Well, the first word is one that Marco, you've already talked a little bit about today.

64
We talked about fundraiser to raise.
我们谈到了募捐活动来筹集。

65
Well, we do have the verb here to raise enough money.
我们这里有动词“筹集足够的资金”。

66
So raise is a verb that means to collect or gather or to get.
所以“筹集”是一个动词，意思是收集或聚集或获得。

67
That's right.
没错。

68
So you wouldn't really say we are collecting money or we are gathering money.
所以你不会真的说我们在收集钱或我们在聚集钱。

69
You say we are raising money for the victims of the earthquake in Haiti.
你会说我们在为海地地震的受害者筹集资金。

70
That's right.
没错。

71
So the reason we don't say we are earning money is because you're not doing any work.
所以我们不说我们在赚取资金的原因是因为你并没有做任何工作。

72
Right.
对。

73
Really, you're not going to the job at 9 o'clock and leaving the job at 5 o'clock.
其实，你并不是在9点钟上班，5点钟下班。

74
You're actually asking people for donations.

Exactly.
正是如此。

So that's what you're doing.
所以这就是你在做的。

77
You are raising money.
你在筹集资金。

78
And now moving on, another way that you can help people maybe through a charity or donation is also to sponsor.
现在继续，另一种你可以通过慈善或捐款帮助人们的方式是赞助。

79
To sponsor someone or something.
赞助某人或某事。

80
Okay, so people can sponsor events or people and companies can also do this as well.
好吧，人们可以赞助活动或个人，公司也可以这样做。

81
So to sponsor someone is basically to give them money in support of a cause.
所以赞助某人基本上是给他们钱以支持某个事业。

82
For example, have you ever done one of those 5k runs or 10k runs?
例如，你有没有参加过5公里或10公里的跑步？

83
Did you have to collect sponsors basically to find people who would help pay money for you to do this run?
你是否需要收集赞助者，基本上找到愿意为你支付这次跑步的人？

84
Not personally, but I know people who have, who actually get companies interested.
我个人没有，但我知道有些人这样做，他们实际上让公司感兴趣。

85
And maybe that person, for example, is going to run five kilometers in this race in order to raise money for victims of some serious illness.
也许那个人，例如，打算在这场比赛中跑五公里，以筹集资金帮助一些严重疾病的受害者。

86
And so they get sponsors, they get companies to donate money for this cause.
所以他们获得赞助者，让公司为这个事业捐款。

87
You could have a person or a company sponsor you.
你可以有一个人或一个公司赞助你。

88
They could be your sponsor by giving you money that you can then use for this charity or special cause.
他们可以通过给你钱来成为你的赞助者，然后你可以用这些钱用于这个慈善或特殊事业。

89
That's right.
没错。

90
But the difference between a fundraiser and to sponsor something or someone is that sponsoring is not always for a charity or for some sort of non-profit cause, right?
但募捐活动和赞助某事或某人的区别在于，赞助不总是用于慈善或某种非营利事业，对吧？

91
We have many sponsors for concerts or for sporting events.
我们有很多音乐会或体育赛事的赞助商。

92
That's right.
没错。

93
So oftentimes when you see athletes, they have their sponsors or their sponsors' logos written all over their jerseys, the clothes that they wear.
所以当你看到运动员时，他们的赞助商或赞助商的标志通常写在他们的球衣和他们穿的衣服上。

94
So for example, if you're watching Formula One racing, you see the Ferrari and the bank emblems and all these different things.
例如，如果你在看一级方程式赛车，你会看到法拉利和银行的标志以及所有这些不同的东西。

95
That's right.
没错。

96
So those are different ways of sponsoring events or people.
所以这些是赞助活动或个人的不同方式。

97
And now moving on, we have a word that's, well, not really related to money and fundraisers, but it's a very interesting word and very common.
现在继续，我们有一个词，嗯，和钱及募捐活动不太相关，但这是一个非常有趣且非常常见的词。

98
When the kids mentioned that they're selling a bunch of tacky Christmas ornaments.
当孩子们提到他们在卖一堆俗气的圣诞装饰品时。

99
Tacky.
俗气。

100
Tacky.
俗气。

101
Okay.
好的。

102
You're going to hear this a lot.
你会经常听到这个。

103
And the interesting thing about the word tacky is that it means something different to everyone.
有趣的是，"tacky"这个词对每个人的意思都不同。

104
So what I think is tacky might be just normal for Marco.
所以我认为tacky的东西对Marco来说可能只是正常。

105
And what Marco thinks is really tacky might be something that I actually like.
而Marco认为非常tacky的东西可能是我实际上喜欢的。

106
Right.
对。

107
And so tacky is basically a bad thing.
所以tacky基本上是个坏东西。

108
It means something is not good looking or not very...
它意味着某样东西不好看或不太...

109
Not very... Fashionable.
不太... 时尚。

110
Fashionable.
时尚。

111
It's like in bad taste.
就像是品味不好。

112
But as you say, taste is something subjective, right?
但正如你所说，品味是主观的，对吧？

113
So maybe, for example... Sometimes we say that when girls wear too much makeup, it's very tacky.
所以例如... 有时我们说女孩化妆太多是非常tacky。

114
Right.
对。

115
Bright red lipstick and blue eyeshadow.
明亮的红色口红和蓝色眼影。

116
Exactly.
正是如此。

117
So a guy might say, oh, that's so tacky.
所以一个男孩可能会说，哦，那太tacky了。

118
Whereas another person might not think it's tacky at all.
而另一个人可能根本不觉得它tacky。

119
So this happens a lot, and we use this word a lot with decorations, for example.
这种情况经常发生，我们经常用这个词来形容装饰，比如说。

120
For someone's house, you might describe it as tacky or a restaurant or a bar.
对于某人的房子，你可能会形容它为tacky，或者一个餐厅或酒吧。

121
Right.
对。

122
So for maybe sometimes those Italian restaurants that have the red and white checkered tablecloths and other pictures of the Italians with the mustaches, I might think that's a little bit tacky.
所以也许有时那些意大利餐厅有红白格子桌布和其他意大利人留着胡子的图片，我可能会觉得那有点tacky。

123
But maybe you think it's cute.
但也许你觉得它很可爱。

124
Right.
对。

125
So something that's tacky.
所以tacky的东西。

126
And as we say, people use it all the time.
正如我们所说，人们一直在使用它。

127
And it's not necessarily a bad thing.
而这不一定是坏事。

128
You can just say, oh, it's a little bit tacky.
你可以说，哦，这有点tacky。

129
Or I think this thing is a little bit tacky.
或者我觉得这个东西有点tacky。

130
Okay.
好的。

131
And that's it, right?
就这样，对吧？

132
Solicit.
征求。

133
Solicit.
征求。

134
Okay.
好的。

135
And our final word on language takeaway.
这是我们关于语言的最后一个要点。

136
Towards the end of the dialogue, when the kids were reading the sign, the sign said, no soliciting.
在对话的最后，当孩子们在读标志时，标志上写着“禁止推销”。

137
And they didn't understand what that means.
他们不明白这是什么意思。

138
What does it mean when you have a sign that says no soliciting?
“禁止推销”是什么意思？

139
Okay, so to solicit is to try to sell something or to offer a service.
好的，推销是试图销售某物或提供服务。

140
So basically, the sign means please don't come to my house and sell me stuff.
所以基本上，这个标志的意思是请不要来我家卖东西。

141
For example, we have door to door insurance salesmen or makeup salespeople.
例如，我们有上门的保险推销员或化妆品推销员。

142
And these people go to your door and they try to sell you their product.
这些人会到你家门口，试图向你推销他们的产品。

143
And no soliciting means don't come to my house.
而“禁止推销”意味着不要来我家。

144
I'm not going to answer the door if you're trying to sell something.
如果你试图卖东西，我不会开门。

145
So to solicit is to try and sell something.
所以推销是试图销售某物。

146
Okay, but usually in person trying to make a sale uninvited, right?
好的，但通常是面对面地试图进行未邀请的销售，对吧？

147
Because if you're a businessman and you have a meeting, a sales meeting, you're not really soliciting with that other person.
因为如果你是商人，有一个销售会议，你并不是在和那个人推销。

148
No, this is basically trying to sell something to a stranger.
不，这基本上是试图向陌生人销售某物。

149
Exactly.
正是如此。

150
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

151
So a lot of interesting words there.
所以有很多有趣的词。

152
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again?

Fluency Builder.
流利度提升。

188
We wanted to make sure that everyone was comfortable with the verb that goes with doorbells.

189
So Marco, what do you do to a doorbell?
所以Marco，你对门铃做什么？

190
You ring the doorbell.
你按门铃。

191
You ring the doorbell.
你按门铃。

192
So you don't touch it, you don't press it.

193
You can press it, but you ring the doorbell.
你可以按，但你按门铃。

194
That's the verb.
这就是动词。

195
Okay, so for example, when I was little, my brother and I always used to fight about who could ring the doorbell.
好的，例如，当我小时候，我和我哥哥总是争谁能按门铃。

196
Really?
真的？

197
Yes.
是的。

198
I loved ringing the doorbell and so did he.
我喜欢按门铃，他也是。

199
Do you do the long ring or do you do the... Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
你是长按还是...叮，叮，叮，叮，叮，叮。

200
You do it like that.

201
The annoying ring.
讨厌的铃声。

202
Yeah, so to ring the doorbell.
是的，所以按门铃。

203
All right, all right.
好吧，好吧。

204
And well, going back, when we were talking about no soliciting, you said that salespeople go door-to-door selling things.
回到我们谈到的禁止推销，你说推销员挨家挨户地卖东西。

205
So this is an interesting phrase and it's a fixed phrase.
这是一个有趣的短语，是一个固定短语。

206
Going door-to-door.
挨家挨户。

207
Well, think about it.
嗯，想想看。

208
So a salesperson who wants to sell maybe some makeup goes to one house and no one wants to buy any makeup there.
所以一个想卖化妆品的推销员去一个家，但那里没有人想买化妆品。

209
So she goes to the next house.
所以她去下一个家。

210
So she's going from house to house, but we don't really say house to house because she's going to your door to offer the makeup.
她是挨家挨户，但我们不真的说挨家挨户，因为她是去你家门口推销化妆品。

211
So we just say going door-to-door.
所以我们就说挨家挨户。

212
That means going to strangers' homes in order, one door after the next, to sell something.
这意味着去陌生人的家，一个接一个地去卖东西。

213
Very good.
非常好。

214
You go door-to-door.
你挨家挨户。

215
So for example, someone can go door-to-door asking for some sugar.
例如，有人可以挨家挨户地要糖。

216
That's right.
没错。

217
Or we could say he is a door-to-door salesman.
或者我们可以说他是一个挨家挨户的推销员。

218
Door-to-door salesman.
挨家挨户的推销员。

219
Very good.
非常好。

220
All right.
好吧。

221
And now we have an interesting question and it's a very good one because it's a question that comes up a lot.
现在我们有一个有趣的问题，这是一个非常好的问题，因为这个问题经常出现。

222
When somebody asks you if you're studying, for example, what grade are you in?
当有人问你是否在学习时，例如，你上几年级？

223
Okay, what grade are you in?
好吧，你上几年级？

224
So in the American system, for example, we have the very, very bottom grade K, which is kindergarten for maybe a five-year-old.
在美国系统中，例如，我们有非常底层的K年级，适合大约五岁的孩子。

225
And at the very top we have high school grade 12.
在最顶层我们有高中12年级。

226
Right.
对。

227
And so in between we have one, two, three, four, five, you know, and up.
所以在中间我们有一、二、三、四、五，等等。

228
And so basically to find out what year in school a student is, you have to ask him or her what grade are you in.
基本上要找出一个学生在学校的年级，你必须问他或她你上几年级。

229
Right.
对。

230
So then the person would say, I'm in sixth grade, I'm in eighth grade.
所以那个人会说，我上六年级，我上八年级。

231
But this is the way you ask this question for a school, as you said, a kid that's maybe five years old all the way to 18 years old in high school.
但这是你问这个问题的方式，适用于五岁到18岁上高中的孩子。

232
What grade are you in?
你上几年级？

233
Now, if you're in university and you want to ask your friend what year of university that person's in, then you say... What year are you?
现在，如果你在大学，想问你的朋友他上大学的哪一年，你就说... 你上几年？

234
What year are you?
你上几年？

235
Yeah, you don't say grade.
是的，你不说年级。

236
So basically grade refers to like what you said, Marco, those first 12 years of school.
所以基本上年级是指你所说的，马尔科，那12年的学校。

237
And so we call them...
所以我们称之为...

238
So you could ask anybody under the age of 18, what grade are you in?
所以你可以问任何18岁以下的人，你上几年级？

239
But when you go to university or when you're talking about university students, it gets a little bit different.
但当你去大学或谈论大学生时，就有点不同了。

240
So you can say what year are you in or what year are you?
所以你可以说你上几年或你上几年？

241
So if you're not sure about someone's age and you maybe think they're in college, you can ask them, what year are you?
如果你不确定某人的年龄，可能认为他们在大学，你可以问他们，你上几年？

242
But generally, anyone under 18, what grade are you in?
但一般来说，任何18岁以下的人，你上几年级？

243
Okay, good.
好的，好的。

244
All right.
好吧。

245
And our last phrase, and this is kind of an expression, right?
我们最后一个短语，这算是一种表达，对吧？

246
Goodness sake, for goodness sake.
天哪，真是的。

247
Okay, so let's look at the context.
好吧，让我们看看上下文。

248
The kids say, we're in grade seven, and the person at the door says, then for goodness sake, don't you see this sign?
孩子们说，我们上七年级，门口的人说，那么天哪，你没看到这个标志吗？

249
Right, for goodness sake.
对，真是的。

250
So this is an expression that's used to indicate maybe you're a little bit frustrated.
这是一个用来表示你有点沮丧的表达。

251
Yes.
是的。

252
Right?
对吧？

253
So it's like, come on, or my goodness, or for Pete's sake.
所以就像，快点，或者我的天，或者为了彼得的缘故。

254
We have many ways of saying, all right, come on.
我们有很多种说法，好的，快点。

255
I'm a little tired of this.
我有点厌倦了。

256
Right, you're irritating me.
对，你让我烦。

257
Right, so basically the person's saying, you are too old for this.
对，所以基本上那个人在说，你太大了，不应该这样。
