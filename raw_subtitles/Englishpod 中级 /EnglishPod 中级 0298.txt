100
Fluency Builder.
流利表达。

The first phrase we have here is one that I really like and I use very often.

102
It's, I think you have hit the nail on the head.
这是，我认为你说得很对。

103
That's right, to hit the nail on the head.

105
Okay, so think about a nail that you're hammering something.
好吧，想象一下你在锤钉子。

106

107
It's very easy to miss, but boom, when you hit it, hit the nail on the head.

108
It means you have it exactly right.

So this was actually a response to one of the questions because it was a very good question and it had a valid point.
这实际上是对一个问题的回应，因为这是一个非常好的问题，并且有一个有效的观点。

111
So this is why Mr. Ford said, you hit the nail on the head.

113
I completely agree with you.

116
Okay, so now this is obviously he's speaking metaphorically, right?
好吧，这显然是他在比喻地说，对吧？

117
That's right.
没错。

118
So David and Goliath, that's actually a story that we often talk about.
所以大卫与歌利亚，实际上是一个我们经常谈论的故事。

119
It's a biblical story.
这是一个圣经故事。

120
So it comes from Christianity and David and Goliath fought, but David was very, very small and Goliath was a monster.
它来自基督教，大卫和歌利亚作战，但大卫非常非常小，而歌利亚是个怪物。

121
He was very, very huge.
他非常非常巨大。

122
And so everyone said, Goliath will win the fight, but David won the fight.
所以每个人都说，歌利亚会赢得战斗，但大卫赢了。

123
And so this is an example or a story that people often use when they say, listen, it may be the case that you think the big giants will win, but actually the small man or our small company will win.
这就是人们常用的一个例子或故事，当他们说，听着，你可能认为大巨人会赢，但实际上小人或我们的小公司会赢。

124
That's right.
没错。

125
As you said, we many times make reference to this, even not in the biblical sense, but it's just the size.
正如你所说，我们很多时候提到这个，即使不是在圣经的意义上，而只是大小。

126
Maybe we're a small company, we're going to fight this big company.
也许我们是一家小公司，我们要与这家大公司竞争。

127
So we say it's a David and Goliath battle or even athletes, maybe two boxers.
所以我们说这是一个大卫与歌利亚的战斗，甚至运动员，可能是两个拳击手。

128
One is bigger than the other.
一个比另一个大。

129
So they'll say it's a David and Goliath boxing match.
所以他们会说这是一个大卫与歌利亚的拳击赛。

130
That's right.
没错。

131
Okay.
好的。

132
Now, when we got the questions about the technical details of the computer, Mr. Ford said that we are a little bit pressed for time right now.
现在，当我们收到关于计算机技术细节的问题时，福特先生说我们现在有点时间紧迫。

133
That's why we can't really answer that question.
这就是为什么我们不能真正回答那个问题。

134
That's right.
没错。

135
And so to be pressed for time means that you don't have a lot of time.
所以时间紧迫意味着你没有很多时间。

136
You are in a rush.
你很匆忙。

137
That's right.
没错。

138
So if you are pressed for time, you don't have too much time.
所以如果你时间紧迫，你没有太多时间。

139
You can't.

147
Let's take another listen to our dialogue and we'll be right back.
