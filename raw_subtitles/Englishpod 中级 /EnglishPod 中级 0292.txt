Why don't we take a look at that now on Language Takeaway.

51
Language Takeaway So, at the beginning of today's dialogue, we heard a word that's very interesting, an anecdote.
Language Takeaway 在今天对话的开头，我们听到了一个非常有趣的词，轶事。

52
What is an anecdote, Marco?
轶事是什么，Marco？

53
Right, he started telling a story, and that's basically an anecdote, a life experience or a story, something that happened to you and you want to share with people.
对，他开始讲一个故事，这基本上就是轶事，生活经历或故事，发生在你身上的事情，你想与人分享。

54
Right, so an anecdote is a story.

So, he was talking about golfing with a client, and so this is called an anecdote.
所以，他在讲与客户打高尔夫的事情，这就是轶事。

56
He was telling a story about it.

57
After that, though, we realized that he is a little bit distracted.
不过之后，我们意识到他有点分心。

58
He says, I'm afraid I got sidetracked there.
他说，我恐怕有点跑题了。

59
That's right.

60
So, he's obviously talking about the computer and the marketing campaign, and then he starts talking about golf and how great it is.
所以，他显然在谈论电脑和市场推广活动，然后开始谈论高尔夫和它有多好。

61
So, he says, I got sidetracked, and that means that you got distracted or you started talking about something that's not related to the topic.
所以，他说，我跑题了，这意味着你分心了，或者开始谈论与主题无关的事情。

62
So, I really like to eat hamburgers, and I like hamburgers with cheese, actually.

63
But wait, sorry, just got a little sidetracked there.

64
I think we should focus on English right now.

66
So, it happens sometimes.
所以，这种情况有时会发生。

67
Maybe you're even talking to someone and something is happening behind that person.
也许你正在和某人交谈，而在那个人身后发生了什么事情。

68
You get sidetracked and you're not really paying attention.
你分心了，没能真正专注。

69
That's right.

70
And after that, we realized that there's still a problem with the projector, and Mr. Ford asks if it's working yet.
然后我们意识到投影仪仍然有问题，Ford先生问它是否能用了。

71
Jonathan, his assistant, says, no, sorry, IT are still fixing it.

72
Alright, so this acronym, IT, I think many of you have heard it, and it means for information technology.
好吧，这个缩写IT，我想你们很多人都听说过，它代表信息技术。

73
Okay, information technology that has to do with computers, and so when we have a technical problem or a computer problem, we usually call IT.
好吧，信息技术与电脑有关，所以当我们遇到技术问题或电脑问题时，通常会联系IT。

74
That's right.

所以，你的公司可能有IT部门，或者如果你有，正如Catherine所说，电脑出现问题，你只需联系IT让他们帮你修理。

76
Exactly.
完全正确。

77
Another computer-related word comes up later when Mr. Ford says that all of the information about the campaign is on the PowerPoint.
另一个与电脑相关的词在后面出现，当Ford先生说关于广告活动的所有信息都在PowerPoint上。

78
That's right.
没错。

79
So, PowerPoint, this is a computer program that is very well known for giving presentations, so you probably use this if you ever have to give a presentation.
所以，PowerPoint是一个非常著名的电脑程序，用于做演示，所以如果你需要做演示，通常会使用这个程序。

80
That's right, and PowerPoint is a part of the Microsoft Office suite, so you know the program Word or the program Excel.
没错，PowerPoint是Microsoft Office套件的一部分，所以你知道Word程序或Excel程序。

81
So, PowerPoint helps you use your computer to give a presentation, so you often hear us just talk about PowerPoint.

82
Can you help me with this PowerPoint in English?

你没有保留，没有节省任何钱，你就是全力以赴。

135

136
Now, when we were talking about Mr. Ford being distracted and he started talking about golf, he said, oh, I'm sorry, I've lost my thread.
现在，当我们谈到福特先生分心并开始谈论高尔夫时，他说，哦，抱歉，我失去思路了。

137
What was I talking about again?
我刚才在说什么来着？

138
Alright, so this is interesting because the word thread can mean something that you, it's like a string that you use to sew clothes with.
好吧，这很有趣，因为“thread”这个词可以指你用来缝衣服的线。

139
But in this particular case, we're talking about a thread of conversation.
但在这个特定的情况下，我们在谈论的是谈话的线索。

140
And so that's basically the topic that he's talking about.

143
Okay, very good.

144
And Mr. Ford actually faced a couple of questions from the audience members.
而福特先生实际上面临了一些观众的问题。

145
One of them asked about the schedule for the campaign, and he said, you know what, I really don't have that information.
其中一个人问关于宣传的日程，他说，你知道吗，我真的没有那方面的信息。

146
I will have to get back to you on that point.
我得再跟您确认一下。

147
Well, this is a really great way to answer a question you don't actually know how to answer.
嗯，这是一种很好的方式来回答你不知道如何回答的问题。

148
In this case, Mr. Ford doesn't have the answer to this audience member's question, like you said, Marco.
在这种情况下，福特先生没有答案，就像你说的，马尔科。

149
So he just says, I will have to get back to you on that.
所以他只是说，我得再跟您确认一下。

150
I will have to let you know later.
我稍后会告诉您。

151
So it's much better to say, I will get back to you, instead of saying, I don't know.
所以说，我会再跟您确认一下，远比说我不知道要好得多。

152
For example, if your boss asks you, I don't know, how were sales last year compared to this year?
例如，如果你的老板问你，我不知道，去年的销售与今年相比如何？

153
And if you don't know, it's really not recommendable to say, I don't know.

161
When finally he was going to present the ad campaign, he said, So without further ado, the new 420 marketing campaign.
当他最终要介绍广告宣传时，他说，没什么好拖延的，新 420 营销宣传。

162
Alright, this phrase, without further ado, is something that we commonly hear in speeches or more formal occasions.
好吧，这个短语，没什么好拖延的，是我们在演讲或更正式的场合中常听到的。

163

164
We say, we're not going to talk about it anymore.
我们说，我们不再谈论它了。

165
Let's just do it.

169
No, there is actually a very famous play by Shakespeare called Much Ado About Nothing.
不，实际上有一部非常著名的莎士比亚戏剧叫《无事生非》。

170
And that means, you know, that there's a lot of talking and a lot of problems and a lot of drama about this one thing.
这意味着，你知道，有很多谈话、很多问题和很多戏剧围绕着这件事。

171
And so, basically, when we say the phrase without further ado, we're saying, you know, without... Further talking or... Talking about this anymore, yeah.
所以，基本上，当我们说“没什么好拖延的”时，我们是在说，知道吗，不再... 进一步谈论或... 不再谈论这个了，是的。

172
Okay.
好的。

173
So it's a nice way to say, okay, finally we're going to do this.
所以这是一个很好的方式来说，好吧，终于我们要做这个了。

174
Or finally we're going to see this.
或者终于我们要看到这个了。

175
And obviously the video was not the campaign.
显然，视频不是宣传。

176
It was his golfing holiday in Barbados.
它是他在巴巴多斯的高尔夫假期。

177
So he asked someone if he could take five.
所以他问某人是否可以休息五分钟。

178
Alright, this phrase, to take five, is very, very common in English.
好吧，这个短语，take five，在英语中非常常见。

179
And it's just another way to say, can we take a five minute break?
这只是另一种说法，问我们可以休息五分钟吗？

180
So maybe you can ask your teacher, excuse me, can we take five?

182
Yeah, or, hey guys, I need a glass of water, let's take five.
是的，或者，嘿，大家，我需要一杯水，我们休息五分钟。

183
Right, so that means let's have a short break, let's take a five minute break.

184
But it doesn't always necessarily have to be five minutes.
但这并不一定非得是五分钟。

185
No, it can be seven minutes or ten minutes, but take five means a short break.
不，它可以是七分钟或十分钟，但 take five 意味着短暂的休息。

186
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

187
So you don't say, can we take ten or can we take seven?
所以你不说，我们可以休息十分钟或七分钟吗？

188
No, you usually just say take five.
不，你通常只说 take five。

189
Take five, okay.
Take five，好吧。
