And today we have a fun dialogue.
今天我们有一个有趣的对话。

6
That's right.

Well, maybe the language in this lesson you won't use every day, but it's fun, it's interesting, and it's a little bit on the lighter side.
也许这节课的语言你不会每天使用，但它有趣、轻松。

8
That's right.
没错。

9
Today we're going to be looking at baby talk, so we're going to see some of these words that aren't really words.
今天我们要讨论婴儿语言，所以我们会看到一些并不是真正单词的词汇。

10
They're not real words that you can find in the dictionary, but native English speakers use them when they're talking to little babies.
这些不是字典里的真实单词，但母语为英语的人在和小宝宝说话时会用到。

11
Yeah, in many languages there's a rule for how you make baby talk words, right?
是的，很多语言都有关于如何构造婴儿语言的规则，对吧？

12
Right.
对。

13
But in English we don't have really clear rules about how you make a word a baby word, so we're going to teach you a few of these baby words.
但在英语中，我们没有明确的规则来将一个词变成婴儿词，所以我们将教你一些婴儿词。

14
Exactly.
正是如此。

15
So before we listen to the dialogue, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.
在我们听对话之前，先来看看词汇预览。

16
Vocabulary preview.
词汇预览。

17
Okay, we have two words here we're going to hear in the dialogue, and the first one is diaper.
好的，我们这里有两个词将在对话中出现，第一个是尿布。

19
Diaper.

20
Okay, so a diaper, a baby uses a diaper.
好的，尿布是婴儿使用的。

21
That's right.

22
It's a piece of cloth or material that you put around the baby so that it can go to the bathroom and not make a mess.
这是一块布或材料，包裹在婴儿身上，以便他们可以上厕所而不弄得一团糟。

26

27
So Nana is the name we call a grandmother.
Nana是我们称呼祖母的名字。

28
Right, so an informal name, just like in Spanish we would say something like abue or abuelita.
对，所以这是一个非正式的称呼，就像在西班牙语中我们会说abue或abuelita。

29
Or in Italian you might say oma.
或者在意大利语中你可能会说oma。

30
This is another way that we can call grandma or granny.
这是我们称呼奶奶或外婆的另一种方式。

嗯-嗯，但他们使用了一些非常有趣的小词汇，这些词汇相当陌生，所以让我们现在在语言总结中看看它们。

63
Alright so as we mentioned before these words aren't actually words that you won't find them in the dictionary.
好吧，正如我们之前提到的，这些词实际上并不是你在字典中能找到的单词。

64
Right but you'll hear them commonly when people are talking to babies and you might see them in a movie or something like that so why don't we get started with the first one.
