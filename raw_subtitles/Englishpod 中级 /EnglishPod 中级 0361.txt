So first up on Language Takeaway is a very unhealthy food.
首先，语言要点是非常不健康的食物。

25
It's called a chocolate sundae.
它叫巧克力圣代。

26
That's right, we wanted to order hamburger, French fries, and a chocolate sundae.
没错，我们想点汉堡、薯条和巧克力圣代。

27
So chocolate, we know that this is the flavor that comes from cocoa.
所以巧克力，我们知道这是来自可可的味道。

28
But what is a sundae?
但圣代是什么？

29
Well, basically, a sundae is a kind of ice cream dessert.
基本上，圣代是一种冰淇淋甜点。

30
It comes in a cup or a bowl, and it's usually vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce, and then oftentimes a cherry on top.
它通常装在杯子或碗里，通常是香草冰淇淋加巧克力酱，通常上面还会有一颗樱桃。

31
Okay, so as you can see, the word is pronounced exactly like the day, sundae, but it has a different spelling in the end.
好吧，正如你所看到的，这个词的发音和星期天（sundae）完全一样，但最后的拼写不同。

32
S -U-N-D-A-E, sundae.
S -U-N-D-A-E，圣代。

33
Right, so this is a chocolate sundae.
对，所以这是巧克力圣代。

34
So when you see this spelling, a sundae with an E, that's the dessert.
所以当你看到这个拼写，带有E的圣代，那就是甜点。

35
If you see it with a Y, that's the day.
如果你看到带Y的，那就是星期天。

36
Exactly.
正是如此。

37
So chocolate sundae, actually a very delicious dessert, but remember it's ice cream.
所以巧克力圣代，实际上是一种非常美味的甜点，但记住它是冰淇淋。

38
That's right.
没错。

39
Now, all of these types of food, hamburger, chocolate sundae, it's called junk food.
现在，所有这些食物，汉堡、巧克力圣代，都叫垃圾食品。

40
Junk food.

41
Well, food, you know.
嗯，食物，你知道的。

43
What is an example of junk, Marco?
垃圾的例子是什么，Marco？

44
Well, something that's not good or useful anymore.

45
So maybe you have trash that you need to get rid of, like an old TV.
所以也许你有需要处理的垃圾，比如一台旧电视。

46
That's junk.
那就是垃圾。

47
So my mom would always say, throw away this junk.
我妈妈总是说，扔掉这些垃圾。

48
It's stuff that you don't need, so junk is things that you would throw away.
这是你不需要的东西，所以垃圾是你会扔掉的东西。

49
Yeah, junk food is the kind of food that's not healthy for you.
是的，垃圾食品是不健康的食物。

50
It's the food that you shouldn't eat, but it tends to be really delicious.
这是你不应该吃的食物，但它往往非常美味。

51
That's right.
没错。

52
So, for example, the hamburger, French fries, a chocolate sundae, all this would fall under this category of junk food.
所以，例如，汉堡、薯条、巧克力圣代，所有这些都属于垃圾食品的范畴。

53
That's right.
没错。

54
And one of the things about junk food is that it's high in cholesterol.
垃圾食品的一个特点是它的胆固醇很高。

55
Now, what is cholesterol, Marco?
现在，胆固醇是什么，Marco？

56
That's right.
没错。

57
So you always have to be careful.
所以你总是要小心。

58
Your doctor says that you shouldn't have, or you have to be careful about having high cholesterol, and that's just basically, it's a type of fat that is found in animal products.
你的医生说你不应该有，或者你必须小心高胆固醇，这基本上是一种在动物产品中发现的脂肪。

59
So, for example, beef has cholesterol, and it's dangerous because it could maybe cause health problems.
例如，牛肉含有胆固醇，这很危险，因为它可能导致健康问题。

60
That's right.
没错。

61
So my friend needed to lower his cholesterol, and his doctor told him he should eat less red meat, eat more vegetables and fruits instead.
所以我朋友需要降低他的胆固醇，他的医生告诉他应该少吃红肉，多吃蔬菜和水果。

62
That's right.
没错。

63
So cholesterol is, you'll see it all the time when you're shopping, you'll see that it's low in cholesterol, or no sugar, or no calories, stuff like that.
所以胆固醇，你在购物时会经常看到，低胆固醇，或者无糖，或者无卡路里，类似的东西。

64
Exactly.
正是如此。

65
Now, a food that is very, very high in cholesterol is fried chicken, but it's also very delicious.
现在，一种胆固醇非常高的食物是炸鸡，但它也非常美味。

66
That's right.
没错。

67
Fried chicken.
炸鸡。

68
Now, as you see, the first word there is fried, and that means that it was cooked in hot oil.
现在，正如你所看到的，第一个词是炸，这意味着它是在热油中煮的。

69
That's right.
没错。

70
And what's important to remember about most American fried chicken is that the chicken is usually put in a batter, so like a milk, egg, flour, sauce, and then it's fried.
重要的是要记住，大多数美国炸鸡通常会裹上面糊，比如牛奶、鸡蛋、面粉、酱料，然后再炸。

71
So on the outside it's very, very crispy and salty.
所以外面非常脆且咸。

72
That's right.
没错。

73
So it's covered in like a type of bread, like a crispy bread.
所以它被覆盖在一种面包上，像脆皮面包。

74
Yeah, that's right.
是的，没错。

75
It's usually very greasy, so when you eat it you have lots of grease on your fingers.
通常非常油腻，所以当你吃的时候，手上会有很多油。

76
But one of the reasons it tastes so good is because as you say, Marco, it's fried in oil.
但它之所以好吃的原因之一是因为，正如你所说，Marco，它是在油中炸的。

77
That's right.
没错。

78
Very good.

121
That's right.

178
It's very very interesting because actually all food that is usually very very delicious is high in cholesterol or high in calories it's bad for you.
这非常有趣，因为实际上所有通常非常美味的食物都含有高胆固醇或高热量，对你有害。

179
