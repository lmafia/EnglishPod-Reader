We need to spend less.

So in order to control spending today, we're talking about budgeting.
所以为了控制今天的开支，我们要谈论预算。

10
So let's take a look at this very important word in today's vocabulary preview.
让我们先看看今天词汇预览中这个非常重要的词。

11
All right, so as you mentioned, budgeting is... what is to budget?
好的，正如你提到的，预算是……预算是什么？

12
To budget.
预算。

13
That's the verb.
这是动词。

14
So budgeting is deciding how to spend your money, okay?
所以预算是决定如何花费你的钱，明白吗？

15
So that means that we prepare a plan for how to spend money.
这意味着我们要准备一个花钱的计划。

16
All right, so that can be a noun and a verb.
好的，所以这可以是名词也可以是动词。

17
A budget is the plan on how you're going to spend money.
预算是你将如何花钱的计划。

18
And to budget is to execute this plan.
而预算就是执行这个计划。

19

24
Welcome, Mr. and Mrs. Carnwell.

So I understand that your family spending has skyrocketed and you want to start budgeting.
我了解到你们的家庭开支激增，你们想开始制定预算。

28
Yes, that's correct.
是的，没错。

29
Frankly speaking, our household income is relatively high and we have never had any money problems.
坦白说，我们的家庭收入相对较高，从未遇到过金钱问题。

30
But I think this is the main reason as to why our spending has gone out of control.
但我认为这正是我们开支失控的主要原因。

31
We have two kids and with allowances paying their credit cards, hours, and not to mention our mortgage and car payments, with the recent economic downturn, my husband's business has suffered and now we need some advice as how we can prepare a family budget.
我们有两个孩子，给他们的零花钱、信用卡、还有我们的抵押贷款和汽车贷款，加上最近的经济下滑，我丈夫的生意受到了影响，现在我们需要一些建议，如何准备家庭预算。

32
I see.
我明白了。

33
Well, you have come to the right place.
好吧，你们来对地方了。

34
First, what we need to do is determine your cash flow, knowing how much money is coming in, will help us allocate spending to different categories such as mortgage, education, groceries, etc.
首先，我们需要确定你的现金流，了解有多少钱进来，这将帮助我们将开支分配到不同的类别，如抵押贷款、教育、杂货等。

35
Yes, that makes sense.
是的，这很有道理。

36
Secondly, I need you to bring all of your receipts for the last two to three months.
其次，我需要你们带来过去两到三个月的所有收据。

37
That way we can determine what your average expenditures are and see which category you're spending money on the most.
这样我们可以确定你们的平均支出，并查看哪个类别的开支最多。

38
Usually your fixed costs are higher and we can't do much about that, but we can usually trim your variable costs such as entertainment or clothing.
通常你的固定成本较高，我们对此无能为力，但我们通常可以削减可变成本，如娱乐或服装。

39
Great!
太好了！

40
We will do that then.
那我们就这么做。

41
Now how about we treat you to a nice dinner?

42
That's another thing.

43
If you really want to stop spending so much money, throw away at least half of your credit cards.
如果你们真的想停止花那么多钱，至少扔掉一半的信用卡。

44
Alright, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

45
So there were some interesting words and phrases in this dialogue related to budgeting in a lot of financial terms here.

46
So let's get started now on language takeaway.
现在让我们开始语言要点。

47
Language takeaway.

48
This first term is very important because it tells us what kind of a budget we're talking about.
第一个术语非常重要，因为它告诉我们我们在谈论什么样的预算。

49
We're not talking about a company here, we're talking about a family.
我们不是在谈论公司，而是在谈论家庭。

50
Right.
对。

51
And so in this case we use the phrase household.
所以在这种情况下我们使用“家庭”这个词。

52
Okay, so what are we talking about?
好的，那么我们在谈论什么？

53
Household income.
家庭收入。

54
Alright, so income we know is the amount of money that comes in to maybe your wallet, right?
好的，收入是指进入你钱包的金额，对吧？

55
My income, my personal income.
我的收入，我的个人收入。

56
That's how much money you earn.

57
Okay, so a household income is how much money the house earns.

58
So all the people that are living in this house, right?
所以所有住在这个房子里的人，对吧？

59
That's right.
没错。

60
So it could be a family, it could be two married people who are married to each other.
所以可以是一个家庭，也可以是两个彼此结婚的人。

61
So the idea is that it's not one person's income, it's the household income.
所以这个概念是，它不是一个人的收入，而是家庭收入。

62
Think of a house.
想象一下一个房子。

63
Alright, so it's the combined income of everyone that's living there or that's making money that lives in this house.
好的，所以这是住在这里的每个人的总收入，或者是住在这个房子里赚钱的人。

64
Right, so if Marco and I have a household, I earn $10,000 and he earns $10,000, our household income is $20,000.
对，所以如果Marco和我有一个家庭，我赚$10,000，他也赚$10,000，我们的家庭收入就是$20,000。

65
Very good.
非常好。

66
Alright, so then now we know that what our household income is and in this case we have children and we give our kids an allowance.
好的，现在我们知道我们的家庭收入是什么，在这种情况下我们有孩子，我们给孩子零花钱。

67
Okay, so I had an allowance when I was a kid.
好的，我小时候也有零花钱。

68
This is the amount of money I got from my parents every week.
这是我每周从父母那里得到的金额。

69
So I get I think $10 a week and I could spend it on anything I wanted and I didn't have to work because my parents gave the money to me.
我每周得到$10，我可以用它买任何我想要的东西，我不需要工作，因为我的父母给我钱。

70
And so an allowance is this money.
所以零花钱就是这笔钱。

71
It's the money that mom and dad give to their children, maybe every month or maybe every week.
这是父母每月或每周给孩子的钱。

72
Now it's not only related to children, right?
现在这不仅仅与孩子有关，对吧？

73
Because maybe if you have a brother or maybe you're married and your wife is a housewife, maybe you give her an allowance, right?
因为如果你有一个兄弟，或者你结婚了，你的妻子是家庭主妇，也许你给她零花钱，对吧？

74
Or the opposite.
或者相反。

75
Maybe you're a house husband and you get an allowance from your wife.
也许你是家庭丈夫，你从妻子那里得到零花钱。

76
That's right.

You can have an allowance if you're anyone.
任何人都可以有零花钱。

78
You can also have an allowance from your company if you go traveling.
如果你出差，你也可以从公司获得零花钱。

79
So if you have a business trip, your company gives you a food allowance.
所以如果你有商务旅行，你的公司会给你食物津贴。

80
That's the amount of money you can spend on food and you don't have to work for it.
这是你可以花在食物上的金额，你不需要为此工作。

81
That's the best part.
这就是最好的部分。

82
Awesome.
太棒了。

83
All right.
好的。

84
So after these allowances, they were talking about, well, how the economic downturn has affected their income and their spending.
所以在谈到这些零花钱后，他们谈到了经济下滑如何影响他们的收入和开支。

85
Okay, so down, you think this is a negative thing.
好的，下降，你认为这是一个负面事情。

86
You're right.
你说得对。

87
Downturn means when something when a situation gets worse, okay, or slows down.
经济下滑意味着当某种情况变得更糟，或者放缓。

88
And in this case, the economy is what got worse.
在这种情况下，经济变得更糟。

89
And you remember this from last year, things started to get very difficult for people who are in business.
你还记得去年，商业人士的情况开始变得非常困难。

90
And this has affected families.
这影响了家庭。

91
And so we call the situation an economic downturn.
所以我们称这种情况为经济下滑。

103
That's a lot.

So now talking about allowances, you said you had an allowance when you were a kid.
现在谈到零用钱，你说你小时候有零用钱。

195
Did you really have a $10 a week allowance?

No, I think it was like eight.

It started out at $6 or $5 a week.

And then I think the most I got was like 10 or 11.

200
So it was like almost about $1 a day.

201
About that.
大约是这样。

202
But usually the point was that well, I started working when I was 15.
但通常来说，我15岁时开始工作。

203
Because my parents thought it was important for children to learn how money works.
因为我父母认为让孩子了解金钱运作很重要。

204
But I was given that money because at the time, it was enough money to go out one night.
但我得到那笔钱是因为当时这足够让我出去一晚。

205
So on Friday nights, if I wanted to go out with my friends, I could go out to watch a movie and get a slice of pizza.
所以在周五晚上，如果我想和朋友出去，我可以去看电影和吃一片披萨。

206
And $10 was was enough.
10美元就足够了。

207
Now $10 doesn't even buy you a ticket to the movie.
现在10美元连电影票都买不到。

208
But at the time, it was it was more than enough.
但那时，这已经足够多了。

209
So this is important, I guess because you know, different families have different ways of upbringing their children.
所以这很重要，我想因为不同的家庭有不同的教育方式。

210
And in many cases, this doesn't happen, right?
在很多情况下，这并不会发生，对吧？

211
If I want to go out to the movies on a Saturday, then my parents will give me $30.
如果我想在周六去看电影，我的父母会给我30美元。

212
And if I want to go out next weekend, they'll also give me money.
如果我下个周末想出去，他们也会给我钱。

213
So it's a it's interesting to see the contrast.
所以看到这种对比很有趣。

214
Because obviously, when I was a kid, also, I didn't really get this opportunity of going out all the time.
因为显然，当我还是个孩子时，我也没有机会一直出去。

215
And actually, I had to work for it.
实际上，我是要为此工作。

216
So if I wanted to go out on the weekend, I would get an allowance.
所以如果我想在周末出去，我会得到零用钱。

217
But also, I would have to wash the car.
但我也必须洗车。

218
That was typical with my dad, I had to wash the car.
这在我爸爸那里是典型的，我必须洗车。

219
Well, I think it's interesting because it shows that the parents want to teach their children about budgeting.
我觉得这很有趣，因为这表明父母想教孩子们预算。

220
Because if you only have $10, you really have to budget, you have to decide how you will allocate that money, even though it's not very much.
因为如果你只有10美元，你真的必须预算，决定如何分配这笔钱，即使这并不多。

221
So in some ways, it's good practice.
所以在某种程度上，这是很好的练习。

222
Yeah, it is.
是的，确实如此。

223
I think it's done as well.
我认为这做得很好。

224
We're not in debt.
我们没有负债。

225
It's not.
不是。

226
Not yet.
还没有。

227
All right.
好吧。

228
So let us know how allowances work in your country.
所以让我们知道你们国家的零用钱是怎么运作的。

229
Or maybe did you have an allowance when you were a kid?
或者你小时候有零用钱吗？

230
