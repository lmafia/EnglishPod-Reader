134
But it's something we say to be superstitious.
但这是我们说的迷信。

这意味着我们希望它不会。

142
But now that you said that, maybe it will.
但现在你这么说，也许会下。

143
Right, right.
对，对。

144
So it's kind of a superstitious belief that people have that if you cross your fingers, it will bring good luck.
所以这是一种迷信信仰，人们认为如果你交叉手指，就会带来好运。

145
Or what you say will happen, will happen or won't happen.

167
That's right.

你经常会听到这被称为饮水机谈话，因为你不想在饮水机旁进行深入的长谈，但你确实想谈论一些基本的事情，与你有共同点的事情，或者工作上的事情，

you know, how's that paper coming along, or how's that, I heard you had great sales last week.

Right.
