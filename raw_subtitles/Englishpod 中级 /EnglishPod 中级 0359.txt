Let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

And when we come back in a moment, we'll be talking about some of these words and phrases that you're about to hear.
等我们稍后回来时，我们将讨论一些你即将听到的单词和短语。

15

16
He wouldn't lie to me.

17
No, I mean, it seems like someone may have hacked his email account and sent that out.
不，我是说，似乎有人可能黑了他的邮箱并发出了那封邮件。

18
I mean, think about it.
我是说，想想看。

19
Why would he email you instead of calling you?
他为什么要发邮件给你而不是打电话给你？

20
Do you really think someone is trying to scam people into sending money?
你真的认为有人在试图诈骗人们汇钱吗？

21
For sure.
当然。

22
There's so many con artists out there you never really know.
外面有很多骗子，你永远不知道。

23
All right, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

24
So let's take a look at some language on Language Takeaway.
所以让我们看看Language Takeaway中的一些语言。

25
Language Takeaway.
Language Takeaway。

26
In Language Takeaway, Marco, one of the first things we hear is that I got an urgent email from Tom.
在Language Takeaway中，Marco，我们听到的第一件事是我收到了Tom的紧急邮件。

27
That's right.
没错。

28
So this is an adjective, something that is urgent.
这是一个形容词，表示紧急的事情。

29
It's urgent.
它是紧急的。

30
That means it needs to be looked at immediately.
这意味着需要立即查看。

31
It's very important.
这非常重要。

32
That's right.
没错。

33
So you can have an urgent email.
所以你可以有一封紧急邮件。

34
That means it's very important email.
这意味着这是一封非常重要的邮件。

35
Or something, a situation can be urgent.
或者某种情况可以是紧急的。

36
Yeah, like an emergency.
是的，比如紧急情况。

37
So urgent care we talk about at the hospital.
所以我们在医院谈论紧急护理。

38
It's something that needs to be looked at by a doctor immediately.
这是需要医生立即查看的事情。

39
Urgently.
紧急地。

40
That's right.
没错。

41
Urgently.
紧急地。

42
That would be the adverb.
那将是副词。

43
Now we go on to say that the email is urgent because it's from Tom and the email said that he is in London and he got robbed.
现在我们继续说这封邮件是紧急的，因为它来自Tom，邮件说他在伦敦被抢了。

44
All right, he got robbed.
好的，他被抢了。

45
All right, so to Rob is the verb R-O-B, but here it's important to look at the verb got.
好的，抢是动词R-O-B，但这里重要的是要看动词got。

46
This means that whatever is happening, it happened to him, to the friend, by someone else.
这意味着发生的事情是发生在他身上，由其他人造成的。

47
That's right.
没错。

48
So someone robbed him.
所以有人抢了他。

49
All right, he got robbed.
好的，他被抢了。

50
That means someone took his money, right?
这意味着有人拿走了他的钱，对吧？

51
That's right.
没错。

52
So the verb would be to get, and robbed would be an adjective ending E-D.
所以动词是get，被抢则是以ED结尾的形容词。

53
But we also have the verb to Rob.
但我们也有动词to Rob。

54
And if you Rob someone, that means that you are stealing his or her money.
如果你抢了某人，那意味着你在偷他的或她的钱。

55
Yeah, if I Rob Marco, it means I take Marco's money from him.
是的，如果我抢Marco，那意味着我从他那里拿走了钱。

56
But if I got robbed by Marco, it means he took my money.
但如果我被Marco抢了，那意味着他拿走了我的钱。

57
That's right.
没错。

58
So remember, if you use the verb to Rob by itself, that means that you are doing the action, or someone is stealing from another person.
所以记住，如果你单独使用动词to Rob，那意味着你在进行这个动作，或者某人正在从另一个人那里偷东西。

59
But if you get robbed, or a person got robbed, that means he or her got money taken from him.
但如果你被抢，或者某人被抢，那意味着他或她的钱被拿走了。

60
Now, the friend got robbed, someone took his money, and we've been asked to wire him some money.
现在，朋友被抢了，有人拿走了他的钱，我们被要求给他汇一些钱。

61
Okay, to wire money.
好的，汇款。

62
That's right, to wire money.
没错，汇款。

63
And this basically means to send money.
这基本上意味着发送钱。

64
It's a very old way or form of sending money.
这是一种非常古老的汇款方式。

65
Basically, you're sending money electronically.
基本上，你是通过电子方式发送钱。

66
You don't actually buy an envelope and put some money in it and send it in the mail.
你实际上并不是买一个信封，把钱放进去然后寄出。

67
You go to a bank or Western Union, and you transfer the money electronically.
你去银行或西联汇款，电子转账。

68
That's right.
没错。

69
So to send an electronic transfer of money, we usually say, you wire someone some money.
所以发送电子转账时，我们通常说，你给某人汇钱。

70
Yeah, I'll wire it to you.
是的，我会给你汇款。

71
That's right.
没错。

72
All right, now continuing on, the main topic about today's lesson is about people trying to scam other people.
好的，现在继续，今天课程的主要主题是关于人们试图诈骗其他人。

73
All right, here the verb to scam means to lie or to be dishonest with someone so that you can take their money or to take advantage of them.
好的，这里动词to scam意味着对某人撒谎或不诚实，以便你可以拿走他们的钱或利用他们。

74
That's right.
没错。

75
So to scam means to take advantage of someone, to lie to someone.
所以to scam意味着利用某人，对某人撒谎。

76
But you also have a scam, a noun, which is a situation where people are trying to take your money.
但你也有一个名词scam，表示人们试图拿走你钱的情况。

77
So a very famous scam might be people in a big city like Paris saying, oh, I'm a tourist, I'm lost, can you help me?
所以一个非常著名的骗局可能是在像巴黎这样的大城市里，有人说，哦，我是游客，我迷路了，你能帮我吗？

78
Can you give me some money to go to the train station?
你能给我一些钱去火车站吗？

79
And really, these people, they're not lost.
而实际上，这些人并没有迷路。

80
They just want you to give them money.
他们只是想让你给他们钱。

81
That's right.
没错。

82
This is called a scam.
这被称为骗局。

83
And what they're doing is they are trying to scam you.
他们正在试图诈骗你。

84
That's right.
没错。

85
And so we actually have a word for these type of people.
所以我们实际上有一个词来形容这些人。

86
We say they are con artists, they are conning you.
我们说他们是骗子，他们在欺骗你。

87
A con artist.
骗子。

88
Okay, so we know what an artist is.
好的，所以我们知道艺术家是什么。

89
An artist is a person who maybe paints pictures or, you know, makes something creative.
艺术家是一个可能画画或创造一些创意的人。

90
But a con is someone who breaks the law.
但骗子是一个违法的人。

91
All right, so a con artist is someone who creatively breaks the law.
好的，所以骗子是一个创造性地违法的人。

92
That's right.
没错。

93
So these are basically thieves or people who take advantage of other people or steal from other people in a very creative way.
所以这些基本上是小偷或利用他人或以非常创造性的方式从他人那里偷东西的人。

94
So there are situations where they may sell something that doesn't even really belong to them.
所以有些情况下，他们可能会出售一些根本不属于他们的东西。

95
That's right.
没错。

96
So the thing to remember here with a con artist is that there's almost always a story.
所以要记住，关于骗子的事情是几乎总是有一个故事。

97
You know, you have to they give you this story, they make you believe them, and then you give them money or you you give them some help that they don't deserve.
你知道，他们给你这个故事，让你相信他们，然后你给他们钱或你给他们一些他们不值得的帮助。

98
And that that way they take it away from you.
这样他们就从你那里拿走了。

99
That's right.
