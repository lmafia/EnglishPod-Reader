That's right.

208
It's very light conversation, very brief as well.
这是一种非常轻松的对话，也非常简短。

209
That's right.

210
And I would like to add that in American culture, people often think it's very rude to ask someone, how much do you earn?

211
How much is your apartment?
你的公寓多少钱？

213
So, you know, in small talk in American culture, and I think a lot of Western cultures, we don't talk about money or religion.
所以，在美国文化的闲聊中，我认为在许多西方文化中，我们不谈论金钱或宗教。

How's the weather, these things?

Yes, yes, this is exactly, I think, one of the main points that when you're learning a language such as English, not only to understand the language, but also the culture.
是的，是的，我认为这正是当你学习像英语这样的语言时，了解语言的同时也要了解文化的主要要点之一。

220
It's very, very different, especially, for example, in Asian cultures where it's no big deal if you go to the hairdresser and the hairdresser asks you how much you earn.
这非常非常不同，尤其是在亚洲文化中，如果你去理发店，理发师问你赚多少钱，这并不是什么大事。

221
But in the United States or many Western countries, it's not something that you talk about your salary or that you really ask.
但在美国或许多西方国家，谈论你的薪水或真正询问这些并不是常见的事情。

222
It's kind of personal information.
这算是个人信息。

223
It is.
是的。

224
And if you talk about it, you might make people very uncomfortable.
如果你谈论这些，可能会让人感到非常不舒服。

225
And so I recommend talking about some of the things that we've discussed here and some of the things that we've discussed in other lessons in this series about small talk.
所以我建议谈论我们在这里讨论的一些事情，以及我们在这个系列的其他课程中讨论的一些闲聊内容。

226
