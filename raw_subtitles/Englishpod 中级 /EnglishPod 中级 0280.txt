Compared with the X420, it is more expensive and there's no doubt that considering the quality and workmanship that goes into the X420, we really win hands down on value for money.
与X420相比，它更贵，毫无疑问，考虑到X420的质量和工艺，我们在性价比上绝对胜出。

30
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at these phrases on Language Takeaway.
好的，我们回来了，现在让我们看看Language Takeaway中的这些短语。

31
Our first phrase comes from the very first sentence of today's dialogue.
我们的第一个短语来自今天对话的第一句话。

32
We heard this phrase, cutting edge technology.
我们听到了这个短语，尖端技术。

33
Now, Marco, what does cutting edge mean?

34
Okay, so as you see in the dialogue, we're talking about technology.
好的，正如你在对话中看到的，我们在谈论技术。

35
And if technology is cutting edge, it basically means it's new, it's very modern, it's the newest you can get.
如果技术是尖端的，基本上意味着它是新的，非常现代，是你能得到的最新技术。

36
It's the most advanced, perhaps.

38
So, what's an example of a current cutting edge technology?
那么，当前尖端技术的例子是什么？

39

47
This is more of a business phrase.
这是一个更商业的短语。

48

50
So, what is a retail price and how is it different from a regular price?
那么，什么是零售价格，它与常规价格有什么不同？

51
Okay, so the retail price is basically the amount of money that you pay for something at the store.
好的，零售价格基本上是你在商店里为某样东西支付的金额。

52
Exactly.
正是如此。

53
So, if I go to a store and I buy a computer for $1,000, I know that the store, they bought the computer for less money.
所以，如果我去商店买一台电脑，价格是1,000美元，我知道商店是以更低的价格买的电脑。

54
Otherwise, they don't earn any money.
否则，他们就赚不到钱。

55
It's a bad business.
这生意就不好。

56
That's right.
没错。

57
So, the retail price is higher than the actual price, the cost of production.
所以，零售价格高于实际价格，即生产成本。

58
So, retail price just basically means exactly what you said, Marco.
所以，零售价格基本上就是你所说的，Marco。

67
Luxury items, luxury brands are very, very expensive.
奢侈品、奢侈品牌非常非常昂贵。

68
That's right.

So, for example, a car such as a Mercedes Benz might be aimed at the luxury market, whereas a car like a Honda Civic is aimed at maybe more of a middle-class market.
例如，像梅赛德斯-奔驰这样的汽车可能是针对奢侈市场，而像本田思域这样的汽车可能更适合中产阶级市场。

70
Exactly.
正是如此。

71
Or in clothing, you could say Gucci is a luxury brand, whereas the Gap or something is a regular consumer brand.
或者在服装方面，你可以说古驰是奢侈品牌，而Gap或其他品牌是普通消费品牌。

72
That's right.
没错。

73
So, this is what we talk about when we refer to a luxury market.
所以，这就是我们谈论奢侈市场时的意思。

74
Now, moving on to the description of the X420, Mr. Ford says that it's amazing quality and that the workmanship is very, very good.

77

通常，当我们谈论奢侈品时，我们期望工艺是非常高质量的。

78
That means that the way that these things are made is the best.
这意味着这些东西的制作方式是最好的。

79
That's right.
没错。

80
It's not going to break in one day.
它不会在一天内坏掉。

81
Usually, I think when you talk about workmanship or luxury items like this, maybe part of it is made by hand.
通常，我认为当你谈论工艺或这样的奢侈品时，可能部分是手工制作的。

82
So, this is what we talk about workmanship is how skilled that person is, or how skilled his hands are to make this great piece of luxury good.
所以，这就是我们谈论工艺时的意思，指的是那个人的技能，或者他手的技能来制作这件伟大的奢侈品。

83
Exactly.
正是如此。

84
So, a very good example in the world of music is the Stradivarius violin.
所以，音乐界的一个很好的例子是斯特拉迪瓦里小提琴。

85
So, Stradivarius violins are very, very expensive because the workmanship is the best quality in the history of world music.

86
That's right.

88
So, that's what we talk about workmanship.
所以，这就是我们谈论工艺的意思。

89
You can apply it to many different things.

But moving on to our last word for language takeaway today, another nice business phrase that we talk about, specifically in sales, is market share.
但继续到我们今天语言外带的最后一个词，另一个我们特别在销售中谈到的商业短语是市场份额。

91
Now, Marco, describe to me market share because I know what a market is.

92
It's where things are bought and sold.

93
But what is a share, market share?

94
So, in this case, we're talking about computers.
所以，在这种情况下，我们在谈论电脑。

95
So, a market share is how much a company owns in the market or how much they sell in this market.
所以，市场份额是指一家公司在市场上拥有多少或他们在这个市场上销售多少。

96
So, for example, if we have a city of a thousand people and everyone there buys computers, if we sell computers to 500 people of that city, that means we own a 50% market share.
例如，如果我们有一个一千人的城市，那里每个人都买电脑，如果我们向这个城市的500人销售电脑，这意味着我们拥有50%的市场份额。

97
Okay.
好的。
