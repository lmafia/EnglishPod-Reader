Okay, very good.

The top is bigger than the bottom, so the bottom you have some paper to hold on to, and the top is round and maybe a little bit hard.

52
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

We'll post pictures of these on the site so you can see what they look like.

55
But moving on now, we have a type of bread.
但现在继续，我们有一种面包。

56
This is a sourdough bread.
这是一种酸面包。

57
Alright, so there are many, many, many different kinds of breads, but sourdough is very unique, because the flavor is a little bit sour.
好吧，有很多很多不同种类的面包，但酸面包非常独特，因为它的味道有点酸。

58
It's strong.

59
So dough is the substance or what you use to make bread, right?
所以面团是制作面包的物质，对吧？

60
Or before bread is baked.
或者在面包烘烤之前。

61
That's right.
没错。

62
So before you make bread, it's kind of like a liquid.
所以在你制作面包之前，它有点像液体。

63
You have some milk or water that you mix with flour, so you have to hold it in a bowl or a cup.
你有一些牛奶或水与面粉混合，所以你必须把它放在碗或杯子里。

64
And after you bake it, it becomes hard.

66
Right, you've seen it when they're making bread, they have this, it looks like a paste sometimes, and then it becomes hard.
对，你见过他们制作面包时，它看起来有时像糊状，然后变得坚硬。

And sour, obviously, because it has that flavor that you said, a very strong sour flavor.

69
That's right.
没错。

70
And a different kind of bread that we might find is whole wheat bread.
另一种我们可能会找到的面包是全麦面包。

71
Okay, now this is like the healthy choice.
好的，现在这是一种健康的选择。

72
Yes, it's normally the healthy choice.
是的，通常是健康的选择。

73
That's because the flour that we put in the dough is whole wheat flour.
这是因为我们放入面团中的面粉是全麦面粉。

74
It's a little bit healthier.
它稍微健康一些。

75
It's usually a little bit darker than white flour, so it'll be brown.
通常比白面粉稍微深色，所以它是棕色的。

76
So yeah, it's basically the brown bread.
所以是的，基本上就是棕色面包。

77
I think if you've noticed when you go to the store and you can get bread, you'll find one that looks white on the inside.
我想如果你注意到，当你去商店买面包时，你会发现一种看起来内部是白色的面包。

78
And this one actually looks brown on the inside.

79
That's right.

80
And an even more brown colored bread, maybe even black, is rye bread.
还有一种颜色更深的面包，甚至可能是黑色的，是黑麦面包。

81
So what is rye?

82
Rye is another kind of grain, and when you bake this rye bread, it has a very strong flavor, and it's very, very dark, almost black.

所以显然，理解面包之间的差异可能有点困难，但我们会在网站上发布图片，以便你们可以看到它们。

90
And also, you have to go out to the bakery and try them so you can taste the difference.
而且，你必须去面包店尝试它们，这样你才能品尝到差异。

91
That's right.
没错。

92
All right, so now let's move on to language takeaway part two, and talk about a little bit more of the other vocab found in this lesson.
好的，现在让我们继续进行语言外语学习的第二部分，谈谈本课中发现的其他词汇。

93
Welcome to Al's Bakery.
欢迎来到Al的面包店。

94
What can I get you?

95
Hi, let me get a dozen croissants, four blueberry muffins, and a loaf of sourdough bread.
嗨，我要一打可颂，四个蓝莓松饼和一条酸面包。

96
Sure.

97
Would you like to have the loaf sliced?

99
Do you have any whole wheat bread?

Oh, we're out at the moment.
哦，我们现在没有。

101
May I suggest some rye bread?

103
Do you have any cakes?

105
I'll just take a cheesecake.

106
Will that be all?
这就全部吗？

107
Yes.
是的。

108
Your total is $43.20.
你的总共是43.20美元。

109
So when you want to go buy some bread or some baked goods, you have to know how to count those goods.
所以当你想去买面包或烘焙食品时，你必须知道如何计算这些商品。

110
So today we have a couple of words to help you count bread.
所以今天我们有几个词来帮助你计算面包。

111
The first one we have is dozen.
第一个是“打”。

112
That's right.
没错。

113
So for croissants, as you can see, it's a countable noun.
所以对于可颂，正如你所看到的，这是一个可数名词。

114
And so when you ask for a dozen croissants, you're asking for 12.
所以当你要一打可颂时，你就是在要12个。

115
That's right.
没错。

116
So in English, the word dozen means 12.
所以在英语中，“打”这个词意味着12。

117
You can buy a dozen eggs, or in this case, a dozen blueberry muffins maybe.
你可以买一打鸡蛋，或者在这种情况下，可能是一打蓝莓松饼。

118
Okay, so it's a very popular term, a dozen or a half a dozen.
好的，所以这是一个非常流行的术语，一打或半打。

119
Sometimes people just buy six.
有时人们只买六个。

120
That's right.
没错。

121
So half a dozen is six.
所以半打是六个。

122
A whole dozen, just say dozen, is 12.
一整打，直接说“打”，是12。

123
You can also have something special called a baker's dozen.
你还可以有一个特别的东西叫做“面包师的打”。

124
Yes, I've heard about this.
是的，我听说过这个。

125
What is a baker's dozen?
什么是“面包师的打”？

126
Well, a baker's dozen is basically a present the baker gives you.
嗯，“面包师的打”基本上是面包师给你的礼物。

127
So you buy 12, maybe 12 croissants, and the baker gives you one more.
所以你买12个，可能是12个可颂，面包师再给你一个。

128
Wow, so you get 13.
哇，所以你得到13个。

129
Yes, a baker's dozen is 13.
是的，“面包师的打”是13。

130
Do you ask for a baker's dozen, or does the baker say, I'm going to give you the baker's dozen?
你是要求“面包师的打”，还是面包师说，我要给你“面包师的打”？

131
I don't think I've ever asked for it.
我想我从来没有要求过。

132
I think when I've bought bagels, and I say I want a dozen bagels, they give me a baker's dozen.
我觉得当我买百吉饼时，我说我想要一打百吉饼，他们给我一个“面包师的打”。

133
They give me 13.
他们给我13个。

134
Okay.
好的。

135
So when you're buying bread, now obviously you don't really buy a dozen sourdough breads.
所以当你买面包时，显然你并不是真的买一打酸面包。

136
You buy a dozen loaves of sourdough bread.
你买的是一打酸面包。

137
So the countable noun here is a loaf of bread.
所以这里的可数名词是“一条面包”。

138
One loaf, two loaves.
一条面包，两条面包。

139
Now this is very interesting, because in English we don't have that many counting words, measure words.
现在这很有趣，因为在英语中我们没有那么多计数词，量词。

140
But for bread, we do actually have this special word.
但对于面包，我们确实有这个特殊的词。

141
So you can say, I would like two loaves of sourdough bread.
所以你可以说，我想要两条酸面包。

142
Okay.
好的。

143
And a loaf, or loaves in the plural, what is it exactly?
一条面包，或者复数形式的面包，究竟是什么？

144
It's one big piece.
它是一大块。

145
So for example, you have maybe one little piece of bread.
例如，你可能有一小块面包。

146
It's called a slice.
它叫做一片。

147
That's what you eat.
那是你吃的。

148
But when you buy the bread, you have many, many, many slices together before you cut the bread.
但当你买面包时，你有很多很多片在切面包之前。

149
That's called a loaf.
那叫做一条面包。

150
Very good.
非常好。

151
So actually this is the reason why the baker, or the person attending the shop, asked if he would like to have the loaf sliced.
所以实际上这就是面包师，或者店员，问他是否想要把面包切片的原因。

152
Would you like the loaf sliced?
你想要把面包切片吗？

153
That means, would you like us to cut pieces of bread from this loaf?
这意味着，你想让我们从这条面包上切出几片吗？

154
Because sliced bread is how you eat it.
因为切片的面包是你吃的方式。

155
Right, exactly.
对，确切地说。

156
You don't really take a whole loaf of bread and start eating it like that.
你不会真的拿着一整条面包就这样开始吃。

157
Like an animal.
像动物一样。

158
No, you cut it into slices.
不，你把它切成片。

159
And so sliced bread, we say, is one option.
所以我们说切片的面包是一种选择。

160
You can also have unsliced, which means when you go home, you cut it yourself.
你也可以选择不切，这意味着回家后你自己切。

161
So this is a very particular word as well, because you have the adjective to have sliced bread, right?
所以这也是一个非常特别的词，因为你有形容词“切片的面包”，对吧？

162
You also have the verb to slice the bread.
你还有动词“切面包”。

163
That means to cut it into slices.
这意味着把它切成片。

164
And of course you have the noun slices of bread.
当然你还有名词“面包片”。

165
So you have the individual pieces.
所以你有单独的片。

166
So it can be a verb, an adjective, and a noun.
所以它可以是动词、形容词和名词。

167
That's right.
没错。

168
So it can be a little confusing, but I recommend you all check out the website and practice a little bit in the comments section.
所以这可能有点混淆，但我建议你们都去网站上看看，并在评论区练习一下。

169
All right, good.
好的，好的。

170
So let's take a listen to the dialogue one last time.
所以让我们最后再听一遍对话。

171
Welcome to Al's Bakery.
欢迎来到阿尔的面包店。

Yes.
是的。

186
Your total is $43.20.
你的总共是43.20美元。

187
All right, so speaking about breads now, there is some particular ingredients that we don't mention in the dialogue, obviously, but they're worth mentioning.
好的，所以说到面包，现在有一些特别的成分我们在对话中没有提到，显然，但值得一提。

188
What is the one main characteristic that most breads have?
大多数面包的一个主要特征是什么？

189
Yeast.
酵母。

190
Yeast.
酵母。

191
That's right.
没错。

192
Y-E-A-S-T.
Y-E-A-S-T。

193
Yeast.
酵母。

194
And yeast is actually alive.
而且酵母实际上是活的。

195
It's an animal.
它是一种动物。

196
It's like a bacteria.
它像细菌一样。

197
That's right.
没错。

198
And so you wonder why are some breads flat and why are some breads big, poofy, large?
所以你会想，为什么有些面包是扁平的，而有些面包又大又蓬松？

199
Well, yeast is why.
嗯，酵母就是原因。

200
Basically, you can't have a big poofy bread, a big, large, tall bread, unless you have this yeast.
基本上，除非你有这种酵母，否则你不能做出大而蓬松的面包。

201
So yeast is what makes the bread rise.
所以酵母是让面包发酵的原因。

202
Yes.
是的。

203
And we also mentioned flour, which is basically just a powder made out of some type of grain, usually.
我们还提到了面粉，基本上就是由某种谷物制成的粉末，通常是这样。

204
Yeah, usually it's made out of wheat.
是的，通常是由小麦制成的。

205
Obviously, whole wheat is a little bit different from the white flour, which would be different processed wheat.
显然，全麦和白面粉有点不同，白面粉是经过不同加工的小麦。

206
But we also have different things that you can even have rice flour.
但我们也有不同的东西，比如米粉。

207
Right, corn flour.
对，玉米粉。

208
Corn flour.
玉米粉。

209
So corn bread would be, of course, yellow because corn is yellow.
所以玉米面包当然是黄色的，因为玉米是黄色的。

210
Now, so you can hear that we say the word flour, like a Rose is a flower, but it's actually spelled different.
现在，你可以听到我们说“面粉”这个词，就像“玫瑰是花”，但它的拼写是不同的。

211
F-L-O-U-R, flour.
F-L-O-U-R，面粉。

212
So there's two different things.
所以有两种不同的东西。

213
There's flowers in your garden, and there's flour, F-L-O-U-R, which is something you can cook with.
你花园里的花和可以用来烹饪的面粉，F-L-O-U-R。

214
That's right.
没错。

215
These are called homophones.
这些被称为同音词。

216
So they basically have the same pronunciation, but very different spellings.
所以它们基本上发音相同，但拼写非常不同。

217
And very different meanings.
意义也非常不同。

218
Exactly.
正是如此。

219
So a very interesting lesson for us today.
今天对我们来说是一个非常有趣的课程。

220
Go out, get some bread, try some of these if you have them available, but also come to the questions and comments section and tell us about maybe your local bread.
出去，买些面包，如果有的话尝试一下，但也来问答和评论区告诉我们你当地的面包。
