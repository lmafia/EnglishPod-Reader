So in this first Language Takeaway today, we have words that are about the kinds of food we're eating today.
在今天的第一个语言学习中，我们有关于我们今天吃的食物种类的单词。

So the first one, the character said, I am craving some type of beef.

39
So to crave something.
所以想吃某样东西。

40
Okay, so that is a verb, to crave.

41
And that means that you have a desire, you really want to eat something, to have a particular thing.
这意味着你有一种渴望，你真的想吃某样东西，想要某种特定的东西。

42
That's right, but it's particular, so it's something specific.

43
For example, pregnant women are famous for craving strange foods like pickles.
例如，孕妇以渴望奇怪的食物如腌黄瓜而闻名。

44
Yeah, exactly.
是的，正是如此。

45
So if you say I'm craving some ice cream, you specifically want ice cream or maybe vanilla ice cream.

46
Exactly.

47
And this person wants beef, but unfortunately there is no beef at Indian restaurants because cows are what?
而这个人想吃牛肉，但不幸的是，印度餐厅没有牛肉，因为牛是什么？

48
Cows are a sacred animal, so they are sacred in India.
牛是神圣的动物，所以在印度是神圣的。

例如，可以说这是一个非常神圣的地方，所以请不要使用相机或手机，并脱掉鞋子。

51
That's right.
没错。

52
So the word sacred refers to something that is religious and very important for that religion, specifically in this occasion, we're talking about the Hindu religion.
所以神圣这个词指的是在宗教上非常重要的东西，特别是在这个场合，我们谈论的是印度教。

53
OK, so the Hindu religion or Hinduism is a religion that's widely practiced in the world and maybe most commonly found in India.
好的，印度教或印度教是世界上广泛实践的宗教，可能在印度最常见。

54
So you'll see a lot of Hindu temples in India and people don't eat beef, like we said, because cows are sacred in the Hindu religion.
所以你会在印度看到很多印度教寺庙，人们不吃牛肉，正如我们所说，因为牛在印度教中是神圣的。

56
OK, so now in India or for Indian food, it's common to not use any type of utensil to eat.

OK, so utensils are tools for eating and it's a very general category.

63
So utensils are spoons, forks, knives, everything.

64
Chopsticks are utensils even.
甚至筷子也是餐具。

65
OK, very good.
好的，非常好。

66
And now since we don't use any utensils, you usually eat with your hand and you scoop up the food, the rice or the curry.
现在因为我们不使用任何餐具，通常用手吃饭，舀起食物、米饭或咖喱。

67
OK, to scoop up, this is a verb and usually you use your hands to scoop something.
好的，舀起，这是一个动词，通常你用手舀东西。

68
So in this case, I can use a piece of bread to scoop up or to pick up some food.
所以在这种情况下，我可以用一块面包来舀起或捡起一些食物。

69
That's right.

所以动词舀起，通常意味着你用手做一个小碗或小形状，以便液体或食物能放进去，就像一个小勺或小杯子。

We've been doing them for a couple of weeks now, and this one is no exception.

We talked a little bit today about chicken dishes and vegetable dishes, but a very general kind of dish in Indian food is a curry.

110
You can have chicken curries and vegetable curries and mutton or lamb curries.

So the dishes are usually called curries.

And an example of a curry, we have a chicken tikka masala curry.
咖喱的一个例子是鸡肉提卡马萨拉咖喱。

122
In this case, for the chicken tikka masala, it's a little bit spicy and it's a color red.

125
And usually you eat this with rice or bread.
通常你会和米饭或面包一起吃。

126
But in India, there's a special... There are many different kinds of bread, but the special bread we heard today was called naan bread.
但在印度，有一种特别的……有很多不同种类的面包，但我们今天听到的特别面包叫做烤饼。

127
Right, naan bread.
对，烤饼。

128
And it's just basically a type of bread.

129
Now, it's not like the bread that you usually have at home.

130
It's a flat bread.

133
It's not fluffy.
它不是蓬松的。

134

135
And the way they cook it is they use this special oven and they cook it inside the oven.

137
That's right.
没错。

138
The oven that we heard is a tandoori oven.
我们听到的烤箱是坦杜里烤箱。

139
OK, so tandoori is just the name of this oven.
好的，所以坦杜里只是这个烤箱的名称。

140
It's also a style of cooking in India and is actually one of my favorite kinds of Indian food because you have these many different kinds of grilled meats.
这也是印度的一种烹饪风格，实际上是我最喜欢的印度菜之一，因为你可以吃到许多不同种类的烤肉。

141
You can have tandoori chicken, tandoori mutton, things like that.
你可以有坦杜里鸡、坦杜里羊肉，类似的东西。

142
Exactly.

144
That's why it's called tandoori.
这就是为什么它叫坦杜里。

And many people are also vegetarians.

147
They don't eat any type of meat at all.
他们根本不吃任何类型的肉。

148
So the first vegetable based dish that we heard is a palak paneer.
所以我们听到的第一个基于蔬菜的菜肴是菠菜奶酪。

149
That's interesting, actually, because paneer is is curd or like a cheese type of cheese type of thing.

150

202

203
So what are we having?
那我们吃什么？

204
Chicken?
鸡肉？

205
There are many amazing dishes to choose from.
有很多美味的菜可以选择。

206
We can have some chicken chika masala, which is an amazing curry.

So Indian food has a reputation of being spicy, but it's very, very delicious.
印度菜以辣闻名，但非常美味。

219
That's right.

220
And you know, what people always tell me, at least my Indian friends always tell me, is that Indian food... saying Indian food is like saying Chinese food.
你知道，人们总是告诉我，至少我的印度朋友总是告诉我，印度菜...说印度菜就像说中国菜。

221
We have some general idea, but every different part of India has its own special foods.
我们有一些大致的了解，但印度的每个不同地区都有自己独特的食物。

222
That's right.
没错。

223
And so what we get in America at Indian restaurants might not be the same as what we get at Indian restaurants in India.
所以我们在美国的印度餐厅吃到的可能和在印度的印度餐厅不一样。

224
So I just want to say that.
我只是想说这一点。

225
But generally, you can find these dishes at any Indian restaurant in America.
但一般来说，你可以在美国的任何印度餐厅找到这些菜。

226
That's right.
没错。

227
Actually, if next time you're in an Indian restaurant or if you ever go, ask them from what region or what area of India the food is from.
其实，下次你在印度餐厅时，或者如果你去的话，问他们这些食物来自印度的哪个地区。

228
Because it may be Northern Indian cuisine, and obviously that is going to be a little bit different than maybe the Southern.
因为可能是北印度菜，显然这和南印度的会有些不同。

229
I think the Southern is supposed to be spicy.
我觉得南印度的应该是辣的。

230
Exactly.
正是如此。

231
And it's just like in every country, even in our own home countries, maybe the food from the coast or from the North will be different from the South or the Inlands.
就像在每个国家，甚至在我们自己的国家，沿海或北方的食物可能和南方或内陆的不同。

232
And I just want to make one more comment.
我还想再说一点。

233
One of my favorite things to do that many Indian restaurants offer in America is the lunch buffet.
我最喜欢的事情之一是许多美国的印度餐厅提供的午餐自助餐。

234
So a buffet is basically a self-serve of food.
自助餐基本上是自助取食。

235
So the restaurant will put out many different dishes and you can take as much as you want of each, but you pay one price.
餐厅会提供许多不同的菜肴，你可以根据自己的喜好取，但只需支付一个价格。

236
All right.
好的。

237
So it's $11.99 or something.
所以大约是11.99美元。

238
That's very, very good.
这非常好。

239
And yeah, so I often do this when I'm home in the States and I just, you know, I get to pick my favorite dishes and I eat as much as I want.
是的，所以我在美国时经常这样做，我可以选择我最喜欢的菜，吃多少都可以。

240
And actually I think one other thing that's worth mentioning, we didn't mention in the dialogue, but the Indian sweets and the tea is very, very good.
其实还有一件值得一提的事，我们在对话中没有提到，印度的甜点和茶非常好。

241
The milk tea that they drink in India is delicious and the sweets are very, very good.
他们在印度喝的奶茶很好喝，甜点也非常好。

242
That's right.
没错。

243
They're famous for being very good and not very healthy for you.
他们以非常好而不健康而闻名。

244
Yeah, exactly.
是的，确实如此。

245
They're very sweet.
他们非常甜。

246
If you're in an Indian restaurant, take note, look for these different things and let us know, do you like to eat Indian food?
如果你在印度餐厅，注意看看这些不同的东西，告诉我们，你喜欢吃印度菜吗？

247
If so, what's your favorite dish?
如果喜欢，你最喜欢的菜是什么？

248
All right.
好吧。

249
So we'll see you guys at our website, EnglishPod.com.
