Alright, so breaking up can be a difficult situation, especially if you're the one breaking up, right?
好吧，分手可能是一个困难的情况，尤其是如果你是那个提出分手的人，对吧？

248
Well, I guess it's never happy if you're the person who's being broken up with or you're the person doing the breaking up.
嗯，我想如果你是被分手的人或是提出分手的人，永远都不会快乐。

249
But you know what, I really noticed that a lot of the phrases the girl used to break up were very like cliche, like you said, they were very common, too common, and kind of a joke almost.
但你知道吗，我真的注意到女孩用来分手的很多短语都很陈词滥调，就像你说的，它们太常见，几乎成了笑话。

250
So the phrase, it's not you, it's me, it's one of them.
所以短语“不是你，是我”就是其中之一。

251
Yeah.
是的。

252
And she also said you deserve better.
她还说你值得更好。

253
You deserve someone better.

256
Yeah.

257
But again, it kind of just it loses its meaning, doesn't it?

258
And also another phrase that's very cliche, but it wasn't in her dialogue was, maybe the timing is just not right.
还有另一个非常陈词滥调的短语，但她的对话中没有提到，那就是“也许时机不对”。

259
Yeah, people say that all the time.
是的，人们总是这么说。

260
Yeah.
是的。

261
So they say no, the timing is not right.
所以他们说，不，时机不对。

262
It's not the appropriate time to be together.
现在不是在一起的合适时机。

263
Yeah, that's just an excuse for not wanting to date that special person.
是的，这只是一个不想和那个特别的人约会的借口。

264
Exactly.
正是如此。

265
So it can be a difficult situation and people do it every day through letters, sometimes through the phone.
所以这可能是一个困难的情况，人们每天都通过信件，有时通过电话来处理。

266
In this case, they were breaking up in person.
在这种情况下，他们是面对面分手的。

267
So listeners, why don't you tell us if you have any stories of breaking up with someone or maybe somebody broke up with you?
所以听众，为什么不告诉我们你是否有和某人分手的故事，或者也许是有人和你分手？

268
