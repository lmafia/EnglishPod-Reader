85
And like in the dialogue, when you fumigate a house, basically you fill the house with fumes or gases that kill bugs.
就像在对话中，当你熏蒸一栋房子时，基本上是用气体或烟雾填满房子来杀死虫子。

86
So people, like you and me, we can't be in the house when that happens, right?

Actually, if you see an exterminator, he will always fumigate wearing a mask so he doesn't inhale those poisonous gas.
实际上，如果你看到一个灭虫师，他总是会戴上口罩进行熏蒸，以免吸入那些有毒气体。

Right, so it's very dangerous for people, and you'll have to make sure you talk to your exterminator to make sure that the gases he's using aren't getting into your body.
对，所以对人来说非常危险，你必须确保与你的灭虫师沟通，以确保他使用的气体不会进入你的身体。
