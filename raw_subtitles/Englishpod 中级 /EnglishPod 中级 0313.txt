正如你们所知，我们有一系列关于英语小谈的课程，所以今天的课程是这一系列的一部分。

5
That's right.

Today we're going to listen to two friends, two girlfriends, meeting and they haven't seen each other for a long time, so we're just going to see how they quickly have a small conversation.
今天我们将听两个朋友，两个女友见面，她们很久没见面了，所以我们来看看她们如何快速进行小对话。

Hey, Michelle, is that you?

Wow, Grace, long time no see.

Where have you been?

So how are things with you, Michelle?

17
Are you still seeing Chris?
你还在和Chris交往吗？

18
No, actually, we split up last month.

19
Oh, dear.

20
I'm sorry to hear that.
听到这个我很遗憾。

21
But I met a really cute guy last night at a networking party.

22
So, well, let's just wait and see.

23
Good for you, Michelle.

24
All right, we're back.

25
So now let's take a look at some of the language on Language Takeaway.
现在让我们看看Language Takeaway中的一些语言。

26
Language Takeaway.
Language Takeaway。

27
So the first word we have here today, Marco, is the word promotion.
今天我们要讨论的第一个词是“升职”。

28
Grace says, Well, you see, I got a promotion, so I moved to the new Pudong office.
Grace说，嗯，你看，我升职了，所以我搬到了新的浦东办公室。

29
That's right.
没错。

30
So she got a promotion, and a promotion is work-related.
她升职了，升职是与工作相关的。

31
That means that you got a better position.
这意味着你得到了更好的职位。

32
That's right.
没错。

33
But you didn't change companies.
但你没有换公司。

34
So in your company, you had a job, and you did well in that job, and so your boss gave you a better job in the company, and that's a promotion.
所以在你的公司里，你有一份工作，你在那份工作中表现良好，因此你的老板给了你更好的职位，这就是升职。

35
That's right.
没错。

36
Okay, so she got a promotion.
好的，所以她升职了。

37
That's when they were talking about work, and now they started talking about their personal life, and Grace asked if Michelle is still seeing Chris.
这是她们谈论工作时的情况，现在她们开始谈论个人生活，Grace问Michelle是否还在和Chris交往。

38
Okay, so the verb here is to see someone, to be seeing someone.
好的，所以这里的动词是“见某人”，即“在交往”。

39
We're not actually talking about eyes and looking.
我们实际上并不是在谈论眼睛和看。

40
We're talking about dating.
我们在谈论约会。

41
That's right.
没错。

42
So if you're seeing Chris, it means you are dating Chris.
所以如果你在和Chris交往，那就意味着你在约会Chris。

43
Okay, so that's an interesting way of describing a relationship.
好的，这是一种描述关系的有趣方式。

44
So you say, Yeah, I'm sorry.
所以你可以说，嗯，我很抱歉。

45
I'm seeing someone.
我在和某人交往。

46
I can't date you.
我不能和你约会。

47
I'm seeing someone else.
我在和其他人交往。

48
Or you could ask someone, Are you seeing anyone right now?
或者你可以问某人，你现在在和谁交往吗？

49
That means, Are you dating anyone?
这意味着，你在约会吗？

50
Do you have a boyfriend, basically?
基本上，你有男朋友吗？

51
Okay.
好的。

52
And sadly, no, they are not together anymore.
可悲的是，他们不再在一起了。

53
She says, Actually, we split up last month.
她说，实际上，我们上个月分手了。

54
Alright, so this is another relationship term.
好的，这又是一个关系术语。

55
To split up means to break up, or to stop dating.
“分手”意味着结束交往，或停止约会。

56
To stop seeing each other.
停止见面。

57
So there are two ways of seeing it, as you said, to split up or to break up.
所以有两种说法，正如你所说，分手或结束交往。

58
That's right.
没错。

59
So unfortunately, they split up, or unfortunately, they broke up.
所以不幸的是，他们分手了，或者不幸的是，他们结束了交往。

60
They are no longer seeing each other.
他们不再见面了。

61
That's right.
没错。

62
Okay.
好的。

63
But she said she had some good news because she met a really cute guy at a networking party.
但她说她有好消息，因为她在一个社交聚会上遇到了一个非常可爱的男孩。

64
What is networking?
什么是社交？

65
Alright, so networking is something that you do, especially in the business world.
好的，社交是你在商业世界中做的事情。

66
You go to events, parties, happy hours, and you meet people.
你去活动、聚会、欢乐时光，认识人。

67
You meet strangers, and you talk about work, and you try to meet as many people as you can.
你遇见陌生人，谈论工作，尽量认识尽可能多的人。

68
Okay, so it's not really a social party to actually just go and meet random people.
好的，所以这并不是一个社交聚会，实际上只是去见随机的人。

69
You're trying to meet people that will be interesting for your business, or maybe to get some other ideas.
你是想认识对你的业务有趣的人，或者获取其他想法。

70
It's for a business purpose.
这是出于商业目的。

71
That's right.
没错。

72
So perhaps in your town, you own a small business, and your town has decided to have a Chamber of Commerce networking party, so you can meet other small business owners.
所以也许在你的城镇，你拥有一家小企业，而你的城镇决定举办一个商会的社交聚会，这样你就可以认识其他小企业主。

73
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

74
So that's what we have for language takeaway.
这就是我们关于语言的总结。

75
Let's go back and listen to our dialogue for the second time.
