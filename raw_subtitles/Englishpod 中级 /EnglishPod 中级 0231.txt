Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.
大家好，欢迎来到EnglishPod。

2
My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

3
My name is Katherine, and we're shoe shopping again.
我叫Katherine，我们又要去买鞋了。

4
That's right.
没错。

5
We are going shoe shopping, but this time it's a little bit more complicated because we're getting women's shoes.
我们要去买鞋，但这次有点复杂，因为我们要买女鞋。

6
That's right.
没错。

7
So there are so many different kinds of women's shoes.
女鞋种类繁多。

8
I'm not even sure I know them all myself, but in this intermediate level lesson, we're going to cover some of the basics for you.
我甚至不确定我是否知道所有种类，但在这节中级课中，我们将为你介绍一些基础知识。

9
That's right.
没错。

10
So before we jump into this dialogue, we have a word that we want to preview with you today, and let's take a look at it now on Vocabulary Preview.
在我们开始对话之前，我们有一个想要预览的单词，现在让我们在词汇预览中看看。

11
Okay, so we're shopping today for a certain kind of shoe.
好的，今天我们要买一种特定的鞋。

12
It's not a sports shoe.
这不是运动鞋。

13
It's a dress shoe.
是正装鞋。

14
Okay, that kind of doesn't make sense because a dress is a noun, a shoe is a noun, and so you want to get a shoe that's a dress?
好吧，这有点不合理，因为“正装”是名词，“鞋”也是名词，所以你想要一双“正装”的鞋？

15
No.
不。

16
A dress shoe is a style of shoe.
正装鞋是一种鞋的风格。

17
It means shoes that you wear when you're wearing fancy clothes.
意思是你穿着华丽衣服时所穿的鞋。

18
So it's kind of like a formal shoe.
所以这有点像正式鞋。

19
A dress shoe is for a type of shoe that would go well with a dress.
正装鞋是与裙子搭配的鞋。

20
That's right.
没错。

21
Not sneakers.
不是运动鞋。

22
But don't be fooled.
但不要被误导。

23
This is not about dresses because men can wear dress shoes too.
这与裙子无关，因为男性也可以穿正装鞋。

24
That's right.
没错。

25
It means shoes you would wear to a conference or to a wedding or to church.
这意味着你会穿去会议、婚礼或教堂的鞋。

26
So these are things that are a little bit fancier than everyday shoes.
所以这些鞋比日常鞋稍微华丽一些。

27
Okay, awesome.
好的，太棒了。

28
So we're shopping for a dress shoe and there are so many types and styles of shoes for women, so why don't we listen to our dialogue for the first time and we'll be back in a second.
所以我们在找正装鞋，女鞋有很多种类和风格，为什么我们不先听听对话，然后我们马上回来。

42
They look great on everyone.
它们在每个人身上都很好看。

43
Too shiny.

44
And I wear pantyhose with my shoes, so let's look for a closed-toe shoe.

45
Okay, these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel, so they are very comfortable.
好的，这是一双非常不错的皮鞋，带有两英寸的跟，非常舒适。

They're too tight.

62
The length is right, but the shoe is too narrow, and it's pinching my toes.
长度合适，但鞋子太窄，夹到我的脚趾。

63
And there'd be no room for my insoles.
而且没有空间放我的鞋垫。

64
Oh, you know what?
哦，你知道吗？

65
I don't think I have the Patience for this today.
我今天没有耐心。

66
They just don't make shoes like they used to.
他们就是不再做像以前那样的鞋了。

67
I'll come back another time.
我改天再来。

68
Have a nice day, ma'am.

69
Alright, we're back.

70
So a lot of shoe styles, as you noticed, a lot of them are very... I don't know, I don't even know what they are.
所以很多鞋款，正如你所注意到的，很多我都不知道是什么。

71
So why don't we try and explain them now on Language Takeaway.

So the first kind of shoe we've got here is very popular in the summer.

It's called a strappy sandal.

这是一种不完全覆盖整个脚的鞋，只覆盖底部。

79
It's very open.
它非常开放。

80
And well, what about strappy?
那么，带带呢？

81
Strappy comes from the word strap.
带带来自于“带”这个词。

82
So a strap is like a thin piece of fabric or leather that connects other pieces.
所以带是连接其他部分的薄布或皮革片。

83
And so a strappy sandal means that it's got many of these different little straps on it, many lines everywhere that connect it.
所以带带凉鞋意味着它有很多不同的小带子，四处连接。

84
So it's very open.
所以它非常开放。

85
It's made of many different thin pieces.
由许多不同的薄片组成。

89
And well, she went on to describe a sleek high heel.

90
So this is a two-part thing here.

91
Sleek is an adjective which basically means really cool looking.
时尚是一个形容词，基本上意味着看起来很酷。

92
Or more like it's pretty and fancy and usually sleek things are also kind of simple.
或者更像是它漂亮、华丽，通常时尚的东西也比较简单。

93
Like a Jaguar's very sleek car.
就像一辆捷豹的非常时尚的车。

94
Okay.
好的。

95
And so this is the adjective to describe the high heels.
所以这是用来形容高跟鞋的形容词。

96
So we have high heels.
所以我们有高跟鞋。

97
Okay, we have high heels that are kind of fancy shoe.
好的，我们有高跟鞋，这是一种华丽的鞋。

98
Basically these are shoes that are not flat.
基本上这些鞋子不是平底的。

99
So the heel is very tall.
所以跟非常高。

100
That's right.
没错。

101
So basically this is what a lot of women wear with dresses.
基本上，这就是很多女性穿着裙子时的鞋子。

102
Basically the heel has a piece that kind of sticks out and makes the woman look taller.
基本上，鞋跟有一部分突出，使女性看起来更高。

103
So basically it's like they're walking on the tips of their toes the entire time.
所以基本上她们就像一直在用脚尖走路。

Those are shorter.

110
Okay.
好的。

111
But high heels there are different kinds.
但高跟鞋有不同种类。

112
One kind is pumps.
一种是泵鞋。

113
Pumps, okay.
泵鞋，好吧。

114
In the dialogue we actually saw the salesman describe them as edgy pumps.
在对话中，我们实际上看到销售员把它们描述为前卫泵鞋。

115
So edgy, what does edgy mean?
那么前卫，前卫是什么意思？

116
Edgy means cool or hip.
前卫意味着酷或时髦。

117
So young people like to wear edgy clothes, like rock and roll kind of clothes.

118
Not so much older people.
年长的人就不太喜欢。

119
Okay, and pumps are a type of high heel you say, but what is the difference?
好吧，泵鞋是一种高跟鞋，但有什么区别呢？

120
Well, pumps basically are the kind of simple heel that a woman will wear with a pantsuit or with a skirt to the office.
嗯，泵鞋基本上是女性穿着西装或裙子去办公室的简单鞋跟。

121
And so they usually have a closed toe and they're quite simple heels.
所以它们通常是封闭的鞋头，鞋跟相当简单。

122
Okay, and the opposite or well maybe a little bit different from pumps would be stilettos.
好吧，与泵鞋相对或稍微不同的是细高跟鞋。

123
So stilettos are a very special kind of heel.
所以细高跟鞋是一种非常特殊的鞋跟。

124
Stiletto.
细高跟。

125
It refers basically to the difference in the back of the shoe where you have the heel.
它基本上指的是鞋后跟的不同。

126
Because sometimes heels are kind of thick and heavy and they make the clonk clonk sound.
因为有时鞋跟比较厚重，会发出咣咣的声音。

127
But stilettos are very very very thin and very very tall.
但细高跟非常非常细，非常非常高。

128
Okay, so stiletto heels.
好吧，所以是细高跟鞋。

129
I think it's probably easier to walk with pumps rather than stilettos, right?
我觉得穿泵鞋比穿细高跟鞋更容易走路，对吧？

130
Stilettos are famous for being very very hard to walk in.
细高跟鞋以非常难走而闻名。

131
It's almost like the back of your heel is a chopstick.
几乎就像你的脚后跟是筷子。

132
Wow, I cannot imagine doing that.
哇，我无法想象这样做。

133
Alright, so this is the classification of our high heels.

134
Why don't we move on now to Mary Janes.

135
Okay, so we've got high heels and heels.
好吧，我们有高跟鞋和鞋跟。

136
We also have flats.

137
These are flat shoes.
这些是平底鞋。

138
So one important kind of flats is a Mary Jane.
所以一种重要的平底鞋是玛丽珍鞋。

139
Sounds like a name.
听起来像个名字。

140
Yeah, it is a name, right?
是的，这确实是个名字，对吧？

Usually little girls wear Mary Janes, but they're pretty popular these days with older people too.

146
Okay, so they're round in the front.
好吧，所以它们前面是圆的。

147
They are usually black.
通常是黑色的。

148
And they have one little strap that goes over the top of your foot.
并且有一条小带子在脚背上。

149
Mary Janes.
玛丽珍鞋。

150
Alright, so we've taken a look at Mary Janes now.
好吧，我们现在看过玛丽珍鞋了。

151
Moving on to, I think it's a similar type of shoe, ballerina shoes.
接下来，我认为是类似类型的鞋，芭蕾舞鞋。

152
Well, ballerina shoes are similar because they're flat.
嗯，芭蕾舞鞋相似，因为它们是平底的。

153
But that's about it.
但就这些。

154
Ballerina shoes are very very thin.
芭蕾舞鞋非常非常薄。

They're pink or white or black.
它们是粉色、白色或黑色的。

158
And they're almost like a slipper.

159
Okay, so they don't have the strap on top.
好吧，所以它们没有顶部的带子。

160
No, they're stretchy and you just slide them onto your foot.
不，它们是有弹性的，你只需将它们滑到脚上。

161
It's named after dancers, ballerinas.
这个名字是以舞者，芭蕾舞者命名的。

162
You know, the dancers who wear pink and they put their hair up and they spin around.
你知道，穿粉色衣服的舞者，她们把头发盘起来，旋转。

163
And they're not hard on the bottom.
而且它们底部不硬。

164
They're usually quite soft and they're always flat.
通常相当柔软，并且总是平的。

165
So maybe these ballerina shoes, they're not the specific types of shoes for dancing if you're a ballerina.
所以也许这些芭蕾舞鞋并不是专门为芭蕾舞者跳舞的鞋。

166
But maybe they're more adequate for maybe walking around the house or something.
但也许更适合在家里走动或其他事情。

167
You don't really go out hiking with ballerina shoes.
你不会穿芭蕾舞鞋去远足。

168
No, you don't go out hiking.
不，你不会去远足。

169
But they're very popular to wear now to school or work.
但现在它们在学校或工作中非常受欢迎。

170
Okay.
好的。

171
And the other type of shoes that we had, actually this was really confusing to me.
还有我们提到的另一种鞋，实际上这让我感到困惑。

172
Slingbacks.
吊带鞋。

173
Slingback shoes.
吊带鞋。

174
Well, slingbacks can be hard because they can be heels.
嗯，吊带鞋可能很难，因为它们可以是高跟鞋。

175
They can be pumps.
它们可以是泵鞋。

176
But it basically refers to a part of the shoe.
但它基本上指的是鞋的一部分。

177
So normal shoes, they cover the back of your foot.
所以普通鞋子覆盖你的脚后跟。

178
But slingbacks have one strap in the back.
但吊带鞋在后面有一条带子。

179
So maybe if I look at my foot in a slingback, I can see part of my heel.
所以也许如果我看我的脚在吊带鞋里，我可以看到我的脚后跟的一部分。

180
Right.
对。

181
Okay.
好的。

182
So slingbacks have a little strap on the back of your heel since the shoe doesn't close in the back.
所以吊带鞋在你的脚后跟后面有一条小带子，因为鞋子后面没有封闭。

183
Right.
对。

184
Okay.
好的。

185
But you also have high heels and women's shoes that don't close in the back.
但你也有高跟鞋和不封闭后面的女鞋。

186
But that you don't have a strap in the back either, right?
但你后面也没有带子，对吧？

Those are open shoes.

So yeah, they're open in the back.

189
But a slingback, there's one strap that keeps your shoe on.

Alright, we're back.
好吧，我们回来了。

240
So now let's take a look at five key things on Fluency Builder.
现在让我们看看流利构建器上的五个关键点。

241
Okay, well the reason we're shopping today is because the woman needs a new pair of shoes because her old shoes can't be worn anymore.
好的，今天我们购物的原因是因为这位女士需要一双新鞋，因为她的旧鞋子不能再穿了。

242
What's wrong with them, Marco?
它们有什么问题，马尔科？

243
She said that they were stretched out of shape.
她说它们已经变形了。

244
Okay, so to stretch or to be stretched out, this means that maybe they've been pulled and worn and they're stretched so much that they don't have the original shape anymore.
好的，所以变形意味着它们可能被拉扯和磨损，已经失去了原来的形状。

245
Right.
对。

246
So just imagine you have a new t-shirt and all of a sudden somebody takes you from your t-shirt and pulls you really hard.
想象一下你有一件新T恤，突然有人用力拉扯你。

247
And usually what happens is this t-shirt is going to be stretched out of shape.
通常情况下，这件T恤会变形。

248
You pulled it so hard that it loses its original form.
你拉得太紧，以至于它失去了原来的形状。

249
So now maybe the neck is very low or the t-shirt is too long on one side.
现在可能领口很低，或者T恤一侧太长。

250
Right.
对。

251
So that's what happens when you stretch something out of shape.
这就是当你拉扯某物变形时发生的事情。

252
Great.
很好。

253
Okay.
好的。

254
So her old shoes are stretched out of shape and they don't provide support anymore.
所以她的旧鞋子变形了，已经不再提供支持。

255
Okay.
好的。

256
So to provide support.
所以提供支持。

257
Now what kind of support is she referring to?
她指的是什么样的支持？

258
She's talking about foot support.
她在说脚部支持。

259
So for example, slippers are a kind of shoe basically that don't provide support.
例如，拖鞋基本上是一种不提供支持的鞋子。

260
They're very soft.
它们非常柔软。

261
But can you walk around all day in slippers?
但你能整天穿拖鞋吗？

262
No.
不能。

263
That doesn't help your foot.
这对你的脚没有帮助。

264
But if you're trying to find shoes that are really good for walking, you need to find ones that provide support.
但如果你想找适合走路的鞋子，你需要找那些提供支持的鞋子。

265
That means that always support your foot, the bottom of your foot.
这意味着始终支持你的脚，脚底。

266
Otherwise your foot gets too tired.
否则你的脚会太累。

267
Not only the bottom, but it could be also your ankle.
不仅是脚底，也可能是你的脚踝。

268
For example, you can't really go hiking with shoes like these with sandals because obviously you're walking around rocks and it doesn't provide support on your ankle.
例如，你不能穿这样的凉鞋去远足，因为显然你在走石头，鞋子对脚踝没有支持。

269
Maybe you can hurt your ankle if you don't have it.
如果没有支持，你可能会伤到脚踝。

270
So maybe a hiking boot will provide more support.
所以也许登山靴会提供更多支持。

271
Exactly.
正是如此。

272
Alright.
好吧。

273
And then the woman also mentioned that it's hard for her to find a shoe because she said, I have a high instep.
然后这位女士还提到她很难找到鞋子，因为她说，我有高脚背。
