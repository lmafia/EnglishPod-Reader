But there's a lot of great stuff in this dialogue that we can use in a lot of different situations, so let's take a look at some of these new words in today's language takeaway.
但这个对话中有很多很棒的内容，我们可以在很多不同的情况下使用，所以让我们看看今天语言收获中的一些新词。

47
Language takeaway.
语言收获。

48
Alright, the first word on language takeaway today is sicko.
好吧，今天语言收获中的第一个词是变态。

49
Sicko is also the name of a movie that was a documentary famous in America by Michael Moore, actually.
变态也是一部由Michael Moore拍摄的著名纪录片的名字。

50
But a sicko in this context means someone who is a bit weird in a bad way.
但在这个语境中，变态指的是有点奇怪的坏人。

51
So if you tell somebody you're sick, but like in that tone, right, you're saying you're sick.
所以如果你告诉某人你很变态，但用那种语气，你就是在说你很变态。

52
You're a sick person.
你是个病态的人。

53
You're gross.
你很恶心。

54
Right, you're saying you're gross.
对，你在说你很恶心。

55
Or people who have inappropriate humor who make jokes about not so nice things.
或者那些有不当幽默的人，开关于不太好的事情的玩笑。

56
Right.
对。

57
Yeah, they're sick.
是的，他们很变态。

58
But in this case, sickos are people who maybe like to hurt other people, or people who are a little bit crazy, people who are not normal.
但在这种情况下，变态是指那些可能想伤害其他人，或者有点疯狂、不正常的人。

59
So it's not a nice way of calling someone crazy, right?
所以这不是称某人为疯狂的好方式，对吧？

60
If you say, oh, he's a sicko, it's not really nice.
如果你说，哦，他是个变态，这并不太好。

61
Not at all.
一点也不好。

62
It's a way of saying that you're almost scared of this person because they're kind of weird and almost... they have problems.
这是一种说法，几乎让你害怕这个人，因为他们有点奇怪，几乎...他们有问题。

63
Alright, so sicko.
好吧，所以变态。

64
Moving on to our next word, we saw that the guy was afraid of telemarketers.
接下来我们看到的词是电话推销员。

65
Exactly.
没错。

66
So what are these guys?
那么这些人是什么？

67
Well, we've got two words being put together here, tele and market.
好吧，这里有两个词组合在一起，tele和market。

68
So tele... Like telephone.
所以tele...像电话。

69
Telephone.
电话。

70
Over communication.
过度沟通。

71
So they're not in person.
所以他们不是亲自来。

72
They're people who call you up and market things.
他们是打电话给你并推销东西的人。

73
They try to sell you stuff over the phone.
他们试图通过电话向你销售东西。

74
So this is very common.
所以这很常见。

75
You get a phone call on your cell phone and they ask you if you're happy with your long-distance calling plan or if you need new TV cable or something like that.
你在手机上接到电话，他们问你是否对你的长途电话计划满意，或者你是否需要新的电视有线电视之类的东西。

76
And they always call during dinner or late at night, which drives me nuts.
他们总是在晚餐时间或深夜打电话，这让我很烦。

77
Exactly.
没错。

78
So these are telemarketers.
所以这些就是电话推销员。

79
These are people who call you trying to sell things to you.
这些是打电话给你试图向你销售东西的人。

80
And very similar to these is solicitors.
与此非常相似的是推销员。

81
Exactly.
没错。

82
But the big difference here with solicitors and telemarketers is that solicitors actually go to your house.
但推销员和电话推销员之间的主要区别是，推销员实际上会到你家。

83
They knock on your door.
他们敲你的门。

84
So they're also called door-to-door salesmen or saleswomen.
所以他们也被称为上门推销员。

85
That's right.
没错。

86
So door-to-door salesmen, they go from door to door trying to sell things.
所以上门推销员，他们从一扇门走到另一扇门，试图销售东西。

87
But in this case, a solicitor is someone who comes to your house to try to get you to do something, to buy something.
但在这种情况下，推销员是指来你家试图让你做某事，买某物的人。

88
All right, very good.
好的，非常好。

89
And moving on to our next word, we have a peeping Tom.
接下来我们有一个偷窥狂。

90
That's right.
没错。

91
We heard this a little bit earlier in the dialogue.
我们在对话中稍早听到过这个。

92
And a peeping Tom is again a negative thing to say about someone.
而偷窥狂再次是对某人的负面说法。

93
A peeping Tom, well, the word peep means to look, but kind of like, yeah, it's a quick look.
一个偷窥狂，嗯，peep这个词意味着看，但有点像，是的，是快速的看。

94
So peeping Tom is a person who spies on other people.
所以偷窥狂是一个窥探其他人的人。

95
Okay.
好的。

96
So a synonym of a peeping Tom would be a voyeur.
所以偷窥狂的同义词是偷窥者。

97
A voyeur.
一个偷窥者。

98
So someone who, without getting caught, tries to look at other people while they're in their homes.
所以在不被抓住的情况下，试图看其他人在家里的人。

99
And so it's really bad because it's usually inappropriate.
这真的很糟糕，因为这通常是不当的。

100
It's usually people who are watching women get undressed or... Right.
通常是那些看着女人脱衣服的人，或者...对。

101
So a peeping Tom is just an informal way of saying a voyeur or somebody who is spying on people.
所以偷窥者只是一个非正式的说法，指的是一个窥视者或正在监视他人的人。

102
So those are the words for today in language takeaway.
这些就是今天的语言要点。

103
Let's listen to our dialogue again.
让我们再听一遍对话。

104
And then we'll be right back.
