No.
不。

24
It also says that I'm open-minded with great ambition, but that I can also be reckless and clumsy.

36
So we're going to divide this up into language takeaway parts one and two.
所以我们将把这分成语言收获的第一和第二部分。

37
So let's start with five key words now on language takeaway.
现在让我们开始五个关键单词的语言收获。

38
Language takeaway.
语言收获。

39
The first adjective that came up was adventurous and outgoing.
第一个出现的形容词是冒险和外向。

40
Outgoing, that's a good one.
外向，这是个好词。

41
Outgoing is a great one.
外向是个很棒的词。

42
So think of the word out.
所以想想“外”的这个词。

43
That means moving outgoing.
这意味着外向。

44
Outgoing means someone is very comfortable talking to strangers or talking to people that they don't know very well.
外向意味着某人非常乐于与陌生人交谈或与不太熟悉的人交谈。

45
For example, my brother is very outgoing.
例如，我的兄弟非常外向。

46
He loves meeting new people.
他喜欢结识新朋友。

47
He loves starting conversations with strangers.
他喜欢和陌生人开始对话。

48
So the opposite would be shy.
所以相反的就是害羞。

49
That's the opposite.
这就是相反。

50
Okay, so outgoing.
好的，所以外向。

51
And then it also describes this person as being a little superstitious.
然后它还描述这个人有点迷信。

52
Okay, superstitious is very interesting because it's hard to describe since everyone's superstitions are different.
好的，迷信是个很有趣的词，因为很难描述，因为每个人的迷信都不同。

53
In many cultures there are different superstitions.
在许多文化中有不同的迷信。

54
So for example, in America we say that walking under a ladder is bad luck.
例如，在美国我们说走在梯子下是不吉利的。

55
Okay, or opening an umbrella inside is bad luck.
或者在室内打开伞是不吉利的。

56
So if you believe that your actions will bring you bad luck, you're probably superstitious.
所以如果你相信你的行为会给你带来厄运，你可能就是迷信的。

57
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

58
So if you are superstitious, you believe in superstitions.
所以如果你迷信，你就相信迷信。

59
That's right.
没错。

60
So Marco, are you superstitious?
那么Marco，你迷信吗？

61
Do you think that black cats bring bad luck?
你认为黑猫会带来厄运吗？

62
No, not at all.
不，完全不是。

63
No?
不？

64
No.
不。

65
Interesting.
有趣。

66
Alright, and this is also an interesting word, a way to describe people who are very believing, a person that is naive.
好的，这也是一个有趣的词，描述那些非常相信的人，天真。

67
Okay, you said this already.
好的，你已经说过了。

68
Naive means that someone generally believes most things that you tell them.
天真意味着某人通常相信你告诉他们的大多数事情。

69
Right.
对。

70
So if I told you, Marco, hey, did you know that it's supposed to rain frogs tomorrow?
所以如果我告诉你，Marco，嘿，你知道明天会下青蛙雨吗？

71
No way, really?
不可能，真的吗？

72
Yeah, really.
是的，真的。

73
If Marco believes me, he's naive.
如果Marco相信我，他就是天真。

74
Right.
对。

75
That means that, you know, probably not going to rain frogs tomorrow.
这意味着，明天可能不会下青蛙雨。

76
But he believes everything I say.
但他相信我说的每一句话。

77
So he's a little bit naive, or inexperienced.
所以他有点天真，或者说缺乏经验。

78
So naive is not really a bad way of describing a person, is it?
所以天真并不是描述一个人的坏方式，是吗？

79
No, but it can be.
不，但可能是。

80
So you want to be careful.
所以你要小心。

81
You know, some people, if you say that they're being naive, it's offensive.
你知道，有些人，如果你说他们天真，那是冒犯。

82
So you have to be careful when you say this.
所以你在说这个的时候要小心。

83
Okay.
好的。

84
Moving on, we also had an interesting adjective that described another person, and it was to be reckless.
接下来，我们还有一个有趣的形容词描述另一个人，那就是鲁莽。

85
I can also be reckless.
我也可能很鲁莽。

86
Reckless.
鲁莽。

87
Okay, so someone who is reckless, often does things without thinking, sometimes things that are dangerous.
好的，所以一个鲁莽的人，通常做事不考虑后果，有时做一些危险的事情。

88
For example, Marco, I think that driving a car without wearing your seatbelt is very reckless.
例如，Marco，我认为不系安全带开车是非常鲁莽的。

89
Okay, that means that you're not thinking about safety.
好的，这意味着你没有考虑安全。

90
Right.
对。

91
So a person that is reckless is kind of a synonym of being a little bit dangerous to be around.
所以一个鲁莽的人有点像是和他们在一起有点危险的同义词。

92
That's right.
没错。

93
Or someone who does things without thinking about their consequences, their results.
或者做事不考虑后果。

94
Okay.
好的。

95
And also, along with reckless, the test said that this person was clumsy.
还有，除了鲁莽，测试还说这个人笨拙。

96
Oh, I love this word.
哦，我喜欢这个词。

97
There was a very famous commercial when I was growing up in America on the television.
在我成长的过程中，美国电视上有一个非常著名的广告。

98
It was all about young students at high school who are clumsy, and so they should buy this special folder for their schoolwork to help them because they're so clumsy.
这是关于高中生笨拙的，所以他们应该买这个特殊的文件夹来帮助他们的学校作业，因为他们太笨拙了。

99
And they're dropping their papers and their books.
他们在掉落他们的文件和书籍。

100
Exactly.
没错。

101
So someone who is clumsy often falls down or hits their head or trips or drops their things.
所以一个笨拙的人经常会摔倒、撞到头、绊倒或掉东西。

102
If I drop something on the floor and break it, my mother might say, you're so clumsy, you should be more careful.
如果我把东西掉在地上摔坏了，我妈妈可能会说，你真笨拙，应该更小心。

103
Yeah.
是的。

104
So clumsy, is this insulting if you say, oh, you're so clumsy?
那么笨拙，这样说“哦，你真笨拙”算不算侮辱？

105
No, it's not so bad.
不，这没那么糟。

106
There are worse things to say.
还有更糟糕的说法。

107
But if someone often drops things, you can call them clumsy.
但如果有人经常掉东西，你可以称他们为笨拙。

108
Or you can also say, you're such a butter fingers.
或者你也可以说，你真是个掉东西的人。

109
Butter fingers.
掉东西的人。

110
That means that your fingers are like butter.
这意味着你的手指像黄油一样。

111
They're very slippery.
它们非常滑。

112
You drop everything.
你掉下所有东西。

113
Okay.
好的。

114
So clumsy and reckless, they are negative adjectives, right?
所以笨拙和鲁莽，它们都是负面形容词，对吧？

115
They're saying that you do things wrong.
他们在说你做事做错了。

116
So it's not really a good thing to be reckless or clumsy.
所以鲁莽或笨拙并不是好事。

117
No, it's not really a good thing.
不，这确实不是好事。

118
These are not positive characteristics.
这些都不是积极的特征。

119
Okay, good.
好的，很好。

120
So we took a look at those five, which are very good about one of the people that took the test.
所以我们看了这五个，这些都是关于参加测试的一个人的很好的描述。

121
Let's move on now to more language and more adjectives on language takeaway part two.
现在我们继续讨论更多的语言和更多的形容词，语言收获第二部分。

122
Language takeaway.
语言收获。

123
Alright, so in this part, we're going to take a look at positive attributes about a person, right?
好吧，在这一部分，我们将看看一个人的积极特质，对吧？

124
They're all good things about someone.
这些都是关于某人的好事。

125
That's right.
没错。

126
And this first one is very good.
而第一个是非常好的。

127
Extraverted, extraverted.
外向，外向。

128
A person that's extraverted.
一个外向的人。

129
So a synonym of this word is outgoing.
所以这个词的同义词是外向的。

130
Okay, so it's pretty much the same thing.
好的，所以这几乎是同样的意思。

131
That's right.
没错。

132
Because extra means going out, out.
因为外向意味着出去，外面。

133
So in this case, someone who is extraverted, often meets new people, goes out and does social things, goes to the movies, goes out with friends, meets, meets strangers, talks to strangers.
所以在这种情况下，外向的人经常会遇到新朋友，外出做社交活动，看电影，和朋友出去，见陌生人，和陌生人交谈。

134
Again, it's like being outgoing, someone who's comfortable with with new people.
再次，这就像是外向，和新朋友相处得很舒服的人。

135
And what about the opposite?
那么相反的呢？

136
So we said that shy is the opposite of outgoing.
所以我们说害羞是外向的反义词。

137
What would be the opposite for extraverted?
外向的反义词是什么？

138
Extraverted's opposite is introverted.
外向的反义词是内向。

139
Intro means in, not out.
内向意味着在里面，而不是外面。

140
So that means someone who's very shy, who is uncomfortable with new people.
所以这意味着一个非常害羞的人，对新朋友感到不舒服。

141
Okay.
好的。

142
And well, apart from being extraverted, the test also said that this person is very diligent.
除了外向，测试还说这个人非常勤奋。

143
Ooh, diligent is a great word.
哦，勤奋是个好词。

144
This is a word you want to hear from your teachers and your bosses.
这是你希望从老师和老板那里听到的词。

145
Okay.
好的。

146
If someone says, Marco, you are very diligent at work.
如果有人说，Marco，你在工作中非常勤奋。

147
What does that mean?
这是什么意思？

148
It means you're very careful.
这意味着你非常细心。

149
You always do things very thoroughly.
你总是做事非常彻底。

150
And also quickly, right?
还有快速，对吧？

151
When you tell them to do something, they do it immediately.
当你告诉他们做某事时，他们会立即去做。

152
That's right.
没错。

153
So a diligent worker always does a good job and does it in a timely manner.
所以一个勤奋的工作者总是做得很好，并且及时完成。

154
Okay.
好的。

155
And moving on to our third adjective.
继续我们的第三个形容词。

156
This one is kind of strange.
这个有点奇怪。

157
It kind of sounds like monogamy, but it's magnanimous.
它听起来有点像一夫一妻制，但它是宽宏大量的。

158
Magnanimous.

159
Alright.
好吧。

160
Magnanimous.

161
This is a great word.

185
And our last description for personalities and the way people are is a person that's daring.

186
Well, this can be a good thing or a bad thing.
嗯，这可以是好事也可以是坏事。

187
It depends on who you're talking about, because sometimes daring people are also reckless.
这取决于你在说谁，因为有时敢于冒险的人也很鲁莽。

188
And this can be dangerous.
这可能是危险的。

189
But sometimes someone who is daring can be doing good things like a daring business person might take risks that other people don't take.

So we took a look at basically 10 key words here, a lot of adjectives, but they're a great way to describe yourself.
所以我们基本上看了10个关键词，很多形容词，但它们是描述自己的好方法。

201
Maybe if you're at a job interview, you know, sometimes a typical question is, how would you describe yourself in using three adjectives?

现在进入描述。

238
What are three adjectives that you would use to describe someone that you hate the most?
你会用三个形容词来描述你最讨厌的某个人吗？

239
So going back to describing people, how would you describe one of the main things that really irritate you about someone?

And this means someone who works very, very hard, who is very, very serious, but who's always anxious, always needs to get things done.
这意味着一个工作非常努力、非常严肃，但总是焦虑，总是需要完成事情的人。

249
Right.
对。

250
And so these people can be very hard to work with because they're controlling and they're never calm.
所以这些人可能很难相处，因为他们控制欲强，从不冷静。

251
So they're not easygoing?
所以他们不随和？

No, they're not easygoing.
不，他们不随和。

253
They always want to do what they want to do.
他们总是想做他们想做的事情。

254
They're usually not very good listeners.
他们通常不是很好的倾听者。

255
And so this type A personality is something that I would say I'm not a big fan of at work or even when we're going out, because, you know, with friends, it's hard to be around someone who always has to control you.
所以我会说，我在工作或外出时不太喜欢这种A型性格，因为你知道，和朋友在一起时，很难和一个总是想控制你的人在一起。

256
This is very interesting.
这很有趣。

257
And I'm sure our listeners have a lot of different ways to describe things that irritate them, maybe about people or maybe attributes that they really admire about someone.
我相信我们的听众有很多不同的方式来描述让他们烦恼的事情，可能是关于人，或者是他们非常欣赏的某些特质。
