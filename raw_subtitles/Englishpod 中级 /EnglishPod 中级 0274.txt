Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.
大家好，欢迎来到EnglishPod。

2
My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

3
My name is Catherine, and today we have part two of a very important and very valuable series about giving presentations.
我叫Catherine，今天我们将进行关于演示的重要系列的第二部分。

4
That's right.
没错。

5
As you well know, we started this series.
正如你们所知，我们开始了这个系列。

6
It's a 10-part series, and today we're going to talk about sales and charts and graphs and more or less explaining maybe a PowerPoint presentation.
这是一个10部分的系列，今天我们将讨论销售、图表以及如何解释PowerPoint演示。

7
That's right.
没错。

8
So you're going to learn some wonderful ways of talking about changes in markets and marketing.
所以你将学习一些关于市场和营销变化的精彩表达方式。

9
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what you've heard.
让我们来听听今天的对话，稍后我们会回来讨论你们所听到的内容。

10
As all of you are well aware, competition in the laptop computer sector is intense.
大家都知道，笔记本电脑行业的竞争非常激烈。

11
We continue to fight with our competitors for market share, and this is the case both in the developed markets in the West as well as more developing markets in Asia and Africa.
我们继续与竞争对手争夺市场份额，这在西方的发达市场以及亚洲和非洲的发展中市场都是如此。

12
You may ask yourself, why is this market so cutthroat?
你可能会问，为什么这个市场如此残酷？

13
Well, the answer is simple.
答案很简单。

14
There is a huge untapped potential market out there, with a huge untapped potential for profit.
外面有一个巨大的未开发潜在市场，利润潜力巨大。

15
If I bring up the first graph here, it shows the increase in terms of number of computer owners across the globe.
如果我展示第一张图表，它显示了全球计算机拥有者数量的增加。

16
As you can see, in the 1980s, computer ownership amounted to around 0.5% of the total world population.
如你所见，在1980年代，计算机拥有率约为全球总人口的0.5%。

17
Since the 1990s, computer ownership has risen dramatically.
自1990年代以来，计算机拥有率急剧上升。

18
In the new millennium, we saw an even larger explosion in computer owners, with figures rising to around 4-5%, an increase of 1000% compared with the 1980s.
在新千年，我们看到计算机拥有者数量更大幅度的爆炸性增长，数字上升到约4-5%，与1980年代相比增加了1000%。

19
If we move on to discuss the figures for China specifically, we can see in chart B that the overall figure for computer ownership stands at around 60 million, which represents a huge increase in a very short time period.
如果我们具体讨论中国的数字，我们可以在图表B中看到，计算机拥有总数约为6000万，这在很短的时间内代表了巨大的增长。

20
Now of course, 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare the total population of China.
当然，如果与中国的总人口相比，6000万只是沧海一粟。

21
And this is a key reason why the personal computer market is such a hot market.
这也是个人电脑市场如此火热的关键原因。

22
For us at Alpha, and of course for all of our competitors as well, we have millions of potential customers who are looking to join the Internet generation.
对于我们Alpha公司，以及所有竞争对手来说，我们有数百万潜在客户希望加入互联网时代。

23
If we do this right, we really can reap huge rewards in a very short time frame.
如果我们做对了，我们真的可以在很短的时间内获得巨大的回报。

24
I'd now like to move on to discuss the X420 brand itself and compare and contrast with some of our key competitors.
现在我想讨论一下X420品牌本身，并与一些主要竞争对手进行比较。

25
Alright, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

26
So now let's start with language takeaway.
现在让我们开始语言要点。

27
Okay, so in the first part of what Mr. Ford is saying, he mentions something called market share.
好的，在Ford先生所说的第一部分，他提到了市场份额。

28
Now, Margo, what is market share?
Margo，什么是市场份额？

29
That's right.
没错。

30
Everyone is competing for market share.
每个人都在争夺市场份额。

31
And this is basically a small portion of your available market.
这基本上是你可用市场的一小部分。

32
So for example, if you sell perfumes, women's perfume, then your market share is maybe women who are 18 to 35 years old in your city or in your town or in your country.
例如，如果你销售香水，女性香水，那么你的市场份额可能是你所在城市、城镇或国家中18到35岁的女性。

33
I see.
我明白了。

34
Right.
对。

35
So when we're talking about market share, because we're sharing a piece of this big pie, we're going to talk about that in terms of a percentage.
所以当我们谈论市场份额时，因为我们在分享这块大蛋糕，我们会用百分比来讨论。

36
So 30% or 15%.
比如30%或15%。

37
That's right.
没错。

38
I think maybe one of the clearest examples is Coca-Cola has, I think, a 60% market share of the carbonated beverages market.
我认为最清晰的例子之一是可口可乐在碳酸饮料市场上拥有60%的市场份额。

39
Interesting.
有趣。

40
So you could say that Apple has a 50% market share of the personal computing industry.
所以你可以说苹果在个人计算机行业拥有50%的市场份额。

41
That's right.
没错。

42
Very good.
非常好。

43
So this is what we refer to as market share.
这就是我们所说的市场份额。

44
Now, as we continue to talk about markets, we have two very interesting words when we refer to a developed market and a developing market.
现在，当我们继续谈论市场时，我们有两个非常有趣的词，分别是发达市场和发展中市场。

45
Okay, so a developed market is something that has been polished and grown over time.
好的，发达市场是经过时间打磨和发展的市场。

46
Perhaps we talk about the developed world being Western Europe and America.
也许我们说发达世界是西欧和美国。

47
But then we have developing markets, and those are markets that are still trying to figure out kind of what's going on.
但我们还有发展中市场，那些市场仍在努力弄清楚发生了什么。

48
They're growing.
它们在增长。

49
They're usually growing much faster than a developed market.
通常增长速度远快于发达市场。

50
That's right.
没错。

51
So again, when we're talking about maybe computers, we consider, for example, the United States a developed market.
所以当我们谈论计算机时，我们认为美国是一个发达市场。

52
Many people already have a computer or express the desire to buy one.
很多人已经拥有计算机或表达了购买的愿望。

53
And so maybe a developing market are some of the African countries where they're still growing.
而发展中市场可能是一些非洲国家，它们仍在增长。

54
And so now they're beginning to purchase more and more computers.
现在它们开始购买越来越多的计算机。

55
Okay, so developed and developing.
好的，所以发达和发展中。

56
Two different ways to describe markets.
描述市场的两种不同方式。

57
That's right.
没错。

58
Now, after that, we hear this phrase cutthroat.
之后，我们听到这个词“残酷”。

59
So someone asks, why is this market so cutthroat?
所以有人问，为什么这个市场如此残酷？

60
What does this mean?
这是什么意思？

61
A cutthroat business or a cutthroat industry.
残酷的商业或残酷的行业。

62
It means that it's very, very competitive.
这意味着竞争非常激烈。

63
Okay, so cutthroat, we're actually talking about maybe having a knife and cutting someone else's throat.
好的，残酷，实际上我们在谈论可能用刀切别人的喉咙。

64
But it's just a metaphor.
但这只是一个比喻。

65
It's a way of saying, yes, this is very competitive.
这是一种说法，是的，这非常具有竞争性。

66
So you're not actually cutting someone's throat.
所以你并不是在真的切别人的喉咙。

67
Right.
对。

68
Everyone is fighting for that market share.
每个人都在争夺市场份额。

69
So it's very cutthroat.
所以竞争非常激烈。

70
Everyone is fighting very, very hard.
每个人都在拼尽全力。

71
But you're not literally killing someone or cutting their throats.
但你并不是在字面上杀死或切割某人的喉咙。

72
And you could even use this to talk about a sporting event.
你甚至可以用这个来谈论体育赛事。

73
You could say, you know, it was a cutthroat game.
你可以说，那是一场残酷的比赛。

74
That's right, that's right.
没错，没错。

75
So anything that's very competitive or very close.
所以任何非常竞争或非常接近的事情。

76
So to finish off language takeaway, when Mr. Ford was towards the end of his presentation, he said that the rewards could be very, very big in a very short timeframe.
所以为了结束语言要点，当Ford先生在演讲结束时，他说回报可能在很短的时间内非常大。

77
So when we say the word timeframe, we mean period of time.
所以当我们说“时间框架”这个词时，我们指的是时间段。

78
It's not like, you know, 2 P.M.
这不是像，知道的，下午2点。

79
It's like from May to June.
而是从5月到6月。

80
We have this short timeframe.
我们有这个短时间框架。

81
It's only two months long.
只有两个月。

82
So timeframe is a window or a period.
所以时间框架是一个窗口或一个时期。

83
That's right.
没错。

84
So this is what he is referring to is that in a very short period or in this period of time, they could make a lot of money, a timeframe.
所以他所指的是在很短的时间内，他们可以赚很多钱，一个时间框架。

85
Right, but how long would a long timeframe be?
对，但长时间框架会有多长？

86
Maybe a couple of years.
也许几年。

87
Alright, so you can have a short timeframe and a long timeframe.
好的，所以你可以有短时间框架和长时间框架。

88
That's right.
没错。

89
Okay, why don't we take a look at our dialogue again and we'll be back shortly with Fluency Builder.
好的，为什么我们不再看看我们的对话，我们很快会回来进行流利度提升。

90

在新千年，我们看到计算机拥有者数量更大幅度的爆炸性增长，数字上升到约4-5%，与1980年代相比增加了1000%。

如果我们具体讨论中国的数字，我们可以在图表B中看到，计算机拥有总数约为6000万，这在很短的时间内代表了巨大的增长。

100
Now, of course, 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare the total population of China.
当然，如果与中国的总人口相比，6000万只是沧海一粟。

101

现在我们为你挑选了几个不同的短语。

107
Let's check those out now on Fluency Builder.
让我们现在在流利度构建器上查看一下。

108
So in today's dialogue, we heard Mr. Ford talk about some numbers.
在今天的对话中，我们听到福特先生谈到了一些数字。

109
He's talking about growth and change in the market.
他谈到了市场的增长和变化。

110
And he says, with figures to around 4 to 5%, we've got an overall increase of 1,000%.
他提到，数字大约在4%到5%之间，我们的整体增长达到了1000%。

111
That's right.
没错。

112
So this phrase, an increase of, very, very common when you're talking about growth of maybe revenue or when you're talking about the growth of a company or sales, for example.
所以这个短语“增长”在谈论收入或公司或销售的增长时非常常见。

113
So it's important to remember here that this is a fixed phrase.
所以这里要记住，这是一种固定短语。

114
We say, an increase of 10% or an increase of 30%.
我们说，增长10%或增长30%。

115
But you can use the same phrase with drops in percentages or money.
但你也可以用同样的短语来描述百分比或金钱的下降。

116
So you can say a decrease of 10%.
所以你可以说下降10%。

117
That means that you go down 10% or a decrease of 100%.
这意味着你下降了10%或下降了100%。

118
That's right.
没错。

119
So a very useful phrase when talking about incrementing someone or as you said, decreasing a decrease of 5%.
所以在谈论增加或减少时，这是一个非常有用的短语，比如你说，减少5%。

120
Now Mr. Ford used a very interesting phrase when referring to the Chinese market.
现在福特先生在提到中国市场时使用了一个非常有趣的短语。

121
Obviously, it's a very big market.
显然，这是一个非常大的市场。

122
And he says that the computer ownership stands at around 60 million.
他表示，电脑拥有量大约在6000万左右。

123
But of course, 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare it to the population of China.
但当然，如果与中国的人口相比，6000万只是沧海一粟。

124
That's right.
没错。

125
So what does this mean?
那这意味着什么呢？

126
It's a big percentage or a small percentage?
是一个大百分比还是小百分比？

127
Very, very small.

128
All right.
好的。

129
So what he's saying here is it's like a drop of water in an ocean.
所以他在这里说的就像是海洋中的一滴水。

130
So a drop of water is so small you don't even notice it.
一滴水是如此之小，你甚至都注意不到。

131
You don't even see it because the ocean is so big.
你根本看不见，因为海洋太大了。

132
And so you can use this in many different ways.
所以你可以用很多不同的方式来使用这个短语。

133
You can say, hey, you know, $5 is just a drop in the ocean.
你可以说，嘿，你知道，5美元只是沧海一粟。

134
Right.
对。

135
It's not really important because it's very little money.
这并不重要，因为这笔钱很少。

136
That's right.
没错。

137
That's right.
没错。

138
So it's sort of like a metaphor saying, you know what?
所以这有点像一个隐喻，意思是，你知道吗？

139
It's very insignificant.

140
It's just a drop of water in an ocean.

142
That's right.

143
Just a drop in the ocean.
只是沧海一粟。

144
And now at the very end of today's speech, we heard the phrase to compare and contrast.
在今天演讲的最后，我们听到了“比较和对比”这个短语。

145
So we're talking about the X420 computer brand itself.
所以我们在谈论X420电脑品牌本身。

146
Now, what does Mr. Ford mean when he says to compare and contrast?
那么福特先生说“比较和对比”是什么意思呢？

147
So when we mentioned the word compare, we are basically trying to determine how they are similar in many ways, the characteristics of how they are similar.
当我们提到“比较”这个词时，我们基本上是在试图确定它们在许多方面的相似性，特征。

148
And to contrast is how they are different, right?
而“对比”是指它们的不同，对吧？

149
That's right.
没错。

150
So let's use an example.
那我们用一个例子吧。

151
Perhaps we could say Pepsi and Coca-Cola.
也许我们可以说百事可乐和可口可乐。

152
Let's compare and contrast.
让我们比较和对比。

153
So they're both carbonated beverages.
所以它们都是碳酸饮料。

154
They are both sweet.
它们都是甜的。

155
And they're pretty much the same color.
而且颜色几乎是一样的。

156
That's right.
没错。

157
And they're also fairly cheap.
而且它们的价格也相当便宜。

158
They have about the same price.
它们的价格差不多。

159
But I would say that Coca-Cola tastes more like prune.
但我会说可口可乐的味道更像梅干。

160
So that would be a contrasting characteristic of Coca-Cola, is that maybe it tastes a little bit sweeter.
所以这就是可口可乐的一个对比特征，可能它的味道更甜一些。

161
It does.
确实如此。

162
And you could also say it's easier to find Coca-Cola.
你也可以说可口可乐更容易找到。

163
Pepsi is less easy to find sometimes.
百事可乐有时不太容易找到。

164
That's right.
没错。

165
Another way that they're different.
这是它们不同的另一个方面。

166
So basically to compare and contrast is to point out how two things are similar and how they're different.
所以基本上，比较和对比就是指出两者的相似之处和不同之处。

167
That's right.
没错。

168
So we've had a lot of interesting phrases there.
所以我们有很多有趣的短语。

169
I think very useful if you're talking about business and marketing and sales.
我认为在谈论商业、市场营销和销售时非常有用。

173
And this is the case both in the developed markets in the West as well as more developing markets in Asia and Africa.
这种情况在西方的发达市场以及亚洲和非洲的更发展中市场都是如此。

174
You may ask yourself, why is this market so cutthroat?

175
Well, the answer is simple.
好吧，答案很简单。

176
There is a huge untapped potential market out there with a huge untapped potential for profit.

177
If I bring up the first graph here, it shows the increase in terms of number of computer owners across the globe.

178
As you can see, in the 1980s, computer ownership amounted to around 0.5% of the total world population.

在新千年，我们看到电脑拥有者的数量更是激增，数字上升到约4-5%，与1980年代相比增长了1000%。

181
If we move on to discuss the figures for China specifically, we can see in Chart B that the overall figure for computer ownership stands at around 60 million, which represents a huge increase in a very short time period.
如果我们继续讨论中国的具体数字，我们可以在图表B中看到，电脑拥有量的整体数字约为6000万，这在很短的时间内代表了巨大的增长。

182
Now, of course, 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare the total population of China.
当然，如果与中国的总人口相比，6000万只是沧海一粟。

183
And this is a key reason why the personal computer market is such a hot market.

We're going to keep on talking with Mr. Ford as he discusses business and a lot of other very interesting and useful skills for talking in public.
我们将继续与福特先生交谈，他将讨论商业以及许多其他非常有趣和有用的公共演讲技巧。

所以，这个系列的目标是帮助你在用英语进行演示时感到更自信。

192
We all know it's very, very hard to talk in English when you're still learning, but it's even harder to talk alone, to give a speech or a presentation.
我们都知道，当你还在学习时，用英语说话是非常困难的，但独自发言、进行演讲或演示更是困难。
