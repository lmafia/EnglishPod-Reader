59
Right, it's a sound that you hear when there's a storm.

72
Okay, so an example of a revolutionary product was the home computer.
好的，所以革命性产品的一个例子是家用计算机。

73
Exactly, because the home computer changed the way people typed and communicated and did all these different things.
没错，因为家用计算机改变了人们打字、交流和做各种事情的方式。

And so it's revolutionary because it introduced a big change.
所以它是革命性的，因为它引入了一个重大变化。

75
That's right.
没错。

76
Okay, so revolutionary.
好的，所以革命性。

77
Towards the end of Mr. Ford's dialogue, he said that they're going to have a Q&A section, and he left us with a quote that, according to him, sums up everything we've discussed today.
在Ford先生对话的最后，他说他们将有一个问答环节，并给我们留下一句名言，按照他的说法，这句话总结了我们今天讨论的所有内容。

78
Okay, to sum up, this is very related to the word to summarize.
好的，to sum up，这与总结这个词非常相关。

79
It means to say in fewer words.
它意味着用更少的词来说。

80
Okay, so this quote says what he wants to say, but it says it in a very short space.
好的，所以这句名言表达了他想说的内容，但用非常简短的方式表达。

81
So if we read a book and I ask you to sum up the story, this is basically, I'm asking for a summary.
所以如果我们读一本书，我问你总结一下故事，这基本上就是我在要求一个总结。

82
That's right.

So I could say, you know, the Harry Potter story is a story about a young boy who is a wizard who loses his parents who goes to school with his friends and learns about his powers.
所以我可以说，你知道，哈利·波特的故事是一个关于一个年轻男孩的故事，他是一个失去父母的巫师，和他的朋友们一起上学，学习他的能力。

112
And I think it's important to point out because we've got a verb and a noun that often go together.

113
Mr. Ford said this kind of computer can really satisfy those needs that users that customers have.

125
Okay.

126
As he continued talking about the X420, he said this is just the beginning.
当他继续谈论X420时，他说这只是个开始。

127
All right.

128
So this is something we often say when we have a long project or plan.

129
You can say, you know, yes, things are good now, but this is just the beginning.
你可以说，你知道，现在情况很好，但这只是个开始。

而且，当他继续谈论公司时，他说客户希望我们引领潮流。

138
Okay.
好吧。

139
So this is an interesting phrase because he's making a comparison with other companies.
这是一个有趣的短语，因为他在与其他公司进行比较。

140
And he's saying, listen, our customers have many needs, but they want us to really be ahead of them and to innovate and to make new things and new computers that will be ahead of the competition.
他在说，听着，我们的客户有许多需求，但他们希望我们真正走在他们前面，创新，制造新的东西和新的计算机，超越竞争对手。

141
So take the lead, be in the front.
所以引领潮流，就是你在前面，给人们一条清晰的道路。

142
So basically the phrase to lead the way is for you to be in the front and give people a clear path.
想想博尔特，那个跑步者。

151
And he finishes his monologue by saying, we cannot let them down.

156
This is a great phrase and you can use it about anybody.
这是一个非常重要的短语，因为它意味着让某人失望。

157
And it's a really important phrase because it means to disappoint someone.
例如，马尔科，当你忘记我的生日时，你真的让我失望。

158
So for example, Marco, when you forgot my birthday, you really let me down.
好吧。

159
Okay.
这意味着我让你失望，因为我忘记了你的生日。

160
So that means I disappointed you because I forgot your birthday.
所以让某人失望就是让他们失望，没有做到你被期望做的事情。

161
So to let someone down is to disappoint them to not do what you were expected to do.
正是如此。

162
Exactly.
所以公司也可以这样做。

163
And so a company can do this.
例如，当像丰田这样的公司制造出有许多问题的汽车时，那家公司让客户失望。

164
For example, when a company like Toyota makes a car that has many problems, that company lets down its customers.

165
So you can let someone down.

166
Basically, you have to have the subject.
基本上，你必须有主语。

167
You let someone down or the company let down its customers.
