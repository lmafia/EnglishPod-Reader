69
So, why don't we take a look at language takeaway?
那么，我们来看看语言要点吧。

70
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

71
So, today's language takeaway, like I said at the beginning of the podcast, is all about time.
所以，今天的语言要点，正如我在播客开始时所说，都是关于时间的。

72
So, we're going to look at some of these important time adverbs.
所以，我们将看看一些重要的时间副词。

73
That's right.
没错。

74
These are called adverbs of frequency, and basically, they are telling us how we do things.
这些被称为频率副词，基本上是告诉我们我们做事情的频率。

75
If we do something all the time, or if we never do something.
如果我们总是做某事，或者从不做某事。

76
Or everything in between.
或者介于两者之间的所有情况。

77
Exactly.
正是如此。

78
So, the first couple we have today are very, very common words.
所以，今天我们有的前几个是非常常见的词。

79
You're going to hear these a lot.
你会经常听到这些。

80
The first one is frequently.
第一个是“经常”。

81
Okay, frequently.
好的，频繁。

82
So, if you do something frequently, consider it to be about 75% of the time.
所以，如果你经常做某事，可以认为是大约75%的时间。

83
Maybe a little bit more, almost 85% of the time.
也许稍微多一点，几乎85%的时间。

84
Right.
对。

85
So, it's not always, but it's very often.
所以，这不是总是，但很常见。

86
So, for example, so, I frequently forget to take my keys when I'm leaving the house, which is a very big problem.
例如，我经常忘记在离开家时带上钥匙，这个问题很大。

87
Exactly.
正是如此。

88
So, considering out of seven days, maybe you forget your keys five days.
所以，考虑到七天中，也许你有五天忘记了钥匙。

89
Not so good.
这可不好。

90
All right.
好吧。

91
So, that's frequently.
所以，这就是“经常”。

92
Now, let's move on to another one that's actually a lot less.
现在，让我们继续另一个实际上少得多的。

93
We talk about seldom.
我们谈谈“很少”。

94
Well, Marco has told me that he seldom forgets his keys.
嗯，Marco告诉我他很少忘记钥匙。

95
That means he almost always remembers them.
这意味着他几乎总是记得。

96
Right.
对。

97
So, seldom is a negative adverb.
所以，“很少”是一个否定副词。

98
It's saying that almost never.
它表示几乎从不。

99
Okay.
好的。

100
So, if I say, for example, I seldom go to the movies.
所以，如果我说，例如，我很少去看电影。

101
That's too bad.
真可惜。

102
I like the movies.
我喜欢看电影。

103
Right.
对。

104
Well, that means that I maybe go to the movie theater once a month.
那么，我可能每个月去一次电影院。

105
Yeah.
是的。

106
Not very often.
不太常去。

107
Seldom.
很少。

108
Not very often.
不太常去。

109
Seldom.
很少。

110
All right.
好吧。

111
Now, going back to a positive adverb of frequency, we have often.
现在，回到一个积极的频率副词，我们有“经常”。

112
You described frequently as very often.
你把“频繁”描述为“非常经常”。

113
That's right.
没错。

114
So, I could also say, I often forget my keys.
所以，我也可以说，我经常忘记我的钥匙。

115
Or, it often rains in tropical places.
或者，热带地区经常下雨。

116
This means this is a common thing.
这意味着这是一个常见的事情。

117
Exactly.
正是如此。

118
So, again, let's consider it to be about 70 to 80 percent of the time.
所以，再次考虑一下，大约70%到80%的时间。

119
Now, with pronunciation, some people like to pronounce often, right?
现在，在发音方面，有些人喜欢发音“often”，对吧？

120
They kind of leave out the strong T sound, while other people say often.
他们有点省略了强烈的T音，而其他人则说“often”。

121
That's right.
没错。

122
Both forms are correct, right?
两种形式都是正确的，对吧？

123
Yes.
是的。

124
They're both correct.
它们都是正确的。

125
So, you're safe using either of these.
所以，使用这两种都没问题。

126
Right.
对。

127
Okay.
好的。

128
And our fourth adverb of frequency is also a positive one, and we say usually.
我们的第四个频率副词也是一个积极的，我们说“通常”。

129
Usually means this is something that you do pretty consistently.
“通常”意味着这是你做得相当一致的事情。

130
I usually brush my hair before I go to sleep.
我通常在睡觉前梳理头发。

131
That means not always, but almost every day.
这意味着不是每次，但几乎每天。

132
Right.
对。

133
So, let's consider that of seven days, you do it six times.
所以，假设在七天中，你做六次。

134
Yeah.
是的。

135
I usually do this.
我通常这样做。

136
Okay.
好的。

137
So, usually is, again, very, very common.
所以，“通常”是非常非常常见的。

138
And something in between, maybe 60 percent of the time, 50 percent of the time, we say regularly.
而在两者之间，可能60%的时间，50%的时间，我们说“定期”。

139
Well, I think of the word regularly as being very closely related to regular.
我认为“定期”这个词与“规律”非常相关。

140
So, basically, if I have a schedule, I do the same thing every day.
所以，基本上，如果我有一个日程，我每天做同样的事情。

141
I do it regularly.
我是定期做的。

142
But sometimes there's a special occasion.
但有时会有特殊的场合。

143
For example, I regularly run five kilometers after work when I go to the gym.
例如，我在下班后去健身房时，定期跑五公里。

144
But sometimes when I want to go out with my friends, I don't run.
但有时当我想和朋友出去时，我就不跑。

145
So, it's not always, but it is pretty regular.
所以，这不是每次，但确实相当规律。

146
Exactly.
正是如此。

147
So, regularly means you do it very often, but there are some exceptions.
所以，“定期”意味着你做得非常频繁，但有一些例外。

148
Okay.
好的。

149
Now, those are our adverbs of frequency, but we have a couple of other phrases that are very similar.
现在，这些是我们的频率副词，但我们还有几个非常相似的短语。

150
So, we want to take a look at those as well.
所以，我们也想看看这些。

151
Let's go back to the beginning of Stephanie's routine when she said that every day I wake up.
让我们回到斯蒂芬妮的日常生活开始时，她说每天我都醒来。

152
Okay.
好的。

153
So, every day means 100 percent of the time every single day.
所以，每天意味着100%的时间，每一天。

154
Monday to Sunday.
从周一到周日。

155
Exactly.
没错。

156
So, obviously, you wake up every day.
所以，显然，你每天都醒来。

157
Or I brush my teeth twice every day.
或者我每天刷两次牙。

158
So, that's 100 percent of the time.
所以，这就是100%的时间。

159
Now, if we say every second day, what does that mean?
现在，如果我们说“每隔一天”，那是什么意思？

160
That means Monday yes, Tuesday no, Wednesday yes, Thursday no, or any day.
那意味着周一是，周二不是，周三是，周四不是，或任何一天。

161
So, basically, she says I wash my hair every second day.
所以，基本上，她说我每隔一天洗一次头。

162
That means one day I wash my hair, but the next day I don't.
这意味着一天我洗头，第二天我不洗。

163
The day after that, though, I wash it again.
但接下来的一天，我又洗一次。

164
Every second day.
每隔一天。

165
Okay.
好的。

166
So, you can say every second day, and I think you can also say every other day.
所以，你可以说每隔一天，我认为你也可以说“每其他一天”。

167
Every other day.
每其他一天。

168
So, every other day or every second day.
所以，每其他一天或每隔一天。

169
He calls his mother every other day.
他每隔一天给母亲打电话。

170
Very good.
非常好。

171
All right.
好的。

172
And she also said that every now and then I remember to choose my outfit.
她还说，每隔一段时间我记得选择我的服装。

173
Okay.
好的。

174
Well, this one's interesting.
这个有趣。

175
This is not very frequent.
这不是很频繁。

176
This is basically saying sometimes.
这基本上是在说有时。

177
Sometimes.

178
So, now and then.
所以，偶尔。

179
Every now and then means I sometimes do it, I sometimes don't do it.
每隔一段时间意味着我有时这样做，有时不这样做。

180
Every now and then I really want to eat chocolate, so I buy a candy bar.
每隔一段时间我真的想吃巧克力，所以我买了一块糖。

181
Okay.
好的。

182
So, maybe you want to eat chocolate twice in a month.
所以，也许你一个月想吃巧克力两次。

183
Yeah, not very often.
是的，不太常见。

184
Not very often.
不太常见。

185
Okay.
好的。

186
And another one that's very similar is from time to time.
另一个非常相似的是“时不时”。

187
So, Marco said that he doesn't go to the movies very frequently, so he goes from time to time.
所以，马尔科说他不经常去看电影，所以他时不时去。

188
Right.
对。

189
So, I can say, I seldom go to the movies or I can say, I like to go to the movies from time to time.
所以，我可以说，我很少去看电影，或者我可以说，我喜欢时不时去看电影。

190
That's right.
没错。

191
Or this girl is describing her appearance.
或者这个女孩在描述她的外貌。

192
She says, from time to time I put my hair up.
她说，时不时我会把头发扎起来。

193
So, that means most of the time.
所以，这意味着大部分时间。

194
That means sometimes it's down, sometimes it's up.
这意味着有时是放下的，有时是扎起来的。

195
Right.
对。

196
So, as you can see, there are many different ways of describing the frequency or how many times you do certain actions or your routine, right?
所以，正如你所看到的，有很多不同的方式来描述频率或你做某些动作或日常的次数，对吧？

197
So, you can use this with a lot of things when you're describing.
所以，当你描述时，你可以用很多东西。

198
And we encourage you to try some of these new ones because a lot of English learners use the same time adverbs whenever they speak.
我们鼓励你尝试一些新的，因为很多英语学习者在说话时使用相同的时间副词。

199
So, try and really use some of these and challenge yourself.
所以，尝试并真正使用一些这些，挑战自己。

200
Exactly.
正是如此。

201
All right.
好的。

202
So, that's all we have for language takeaway.
所以，这就是我们语言学习的要点。

203
Why don't we move on now to fluency builder?
我们现在为什么不继续进行流利度训练呢？

204
Fluency builder.
流利度训练。

205
Okay.
好的。

206
So, using some of these adverbs, I could say, I can say, I regularly make a pot of coffee in the morning.
所以，使用一些这些副词，我可以说，我每天早上定期煮一壶咖啡。

207
Okay.
好的。

208
So, a pot of coffee.
所以，一壶咖啡。

209
You regularly make a pot of coffee.
你定期煮一壶咖啡。

210
That means you like to drink coffee every day.
这意味着你每天都喜欢喝咖啡。

211
That's right.
没错。

212
I always need my cup of coffee in the morning.
我早上总是需要我的一杯咖啡。

213
So, I usually make it first thing.
所以，我通常第一件事就是煮咖啡。

214
So, a pot of coffee, we know what a cup of coffee is, but a pot of coffee, what is a pot?
所以，一壶咖啡，我们知道一杯咖啡是什么，但一壶咖啡，什么是一壶？

215
A pot is basically the container that you use when you brew coffee, when you make it.
一壶基本上是你在冲泡咖啡时使用的容器。

216
So, you put the coffee beans in the machine, and instead of having a cup underneath, you have a bigger container that's a pot.
所以，你把咖啡豆放进机器里，而不是在下面放一杯，而是有一个更大的容器，就是一壶。

217
You can also have a pot of tea.
你也可以有一壶茶。

218
Exactly.
没错。

219
It's many cups, usually eight or ten cups.
通常是八到十杯。

220
All right.

221
And remember that verb, to brew coffee.

冲泡一壶咖啡。

224
I'm brewing some coffee.
我正在冲泡咖啡。

225
All right.
好的。

226
So, apart from coffee and all of these things, let's take a look at some of the specific phrases that she used when she was talking about her hair, because I think her hair is very complicated.
除了咖啡和这些东西，让我们看看她在谈论她的头发时使用的一些具体短语，因为我觉得她的头发很复杂。

227
It is very complicated.
确实很复杂。

228
Sometimes she washes her hair, sometimes she doesn't wash her hair, sometimes she blow dries it straight.
有时她洗头，有时不洗，有时她把头发吹直。

229
Okay.
好的。

230
So, to blow dry means that you use a blow dryer.
所以，吹干意味着你使用吹风机。

231
That's right.
没错。

232
This is a machine that uses electricity to blow hot air on your hair so that your hair will dry quickly.
这是一种使用电力将热空气吹到你头发上的机器，以便你的头发能快速干燥。

233
But you can blow dry your hair in many ways.
但你可以用很多方式吹干头发。

234
Some people have curly hair, and they have special tools for making their hair curly.
有些人有卷发，他们有特殊的工具来让头发卷曲。

235
But she says she blow dries it straight.
但她说她把头发吹直。

236
That means she makes it straight with the hot air.
这意味着她用热空气把头发弄直。

237
Right.
对。

238
So, I think the way you do this is you take the blow dryer and a brush, and you brush while you blow dry, right?
所以，我认为你这样做的方法是你拿着吹风机和一把刷子，同时吹干和刷头发，对吧？

239
Yep.
是的。

240
Making lines.
制造线条。

241
See, I know a little bit about this.
看，我对这个有一点了解。

242
Even though I don't have long enough hair for this.
尽管我没有足够长的头发。

243
No, I guess... Well, maybe you are secretly one of those guys who has a routine like this woman.
不，我想... 好吧，也许你秘密地是那种有像这个女人一样的日常的人。

244
I don't think I can take this much time in the shower and brushing my hair.
我觉得我不能在洗澡和梳头发上花这么多时间。

245
But moving on, actually, I also know this next phrase.
但继续，实际上，我也知道下一个短语。

246
To flat iron your hair.
拉直头发。

247
Okay, so flat iron is a noun and a verb.
好的，所以拉直是名词也是动词。

248
So I use a flat iron or I can flat iron my hair.
所以我使用拉直器，或者我可以拉直我的头发。

249
This is a tool that we use that's very, very hot.
这是我们使用的一个非常非常热的工具。

250
Think of an iron.
想想熨斗。

251
It's very, very hot.
它非常非常热。

252
And it basically presses my hair and makes it very, very, very thin and flat and straight.
它基本上压平我的头发，使其非常非常薄、平坦和直。

253
Right, so I think people that have straight hair don't need to really flat iron their hair.
对，所以我认为有直发的人不需要真的拉直他们的头发。

254
Nah, but if you have very curly hair, then you need it.
不，但如果你有非常卷曲的头发，那你就需要。

255
So what's the difference?
那么有什么区别？

256
Give us the insight here.
给我们一些见解。

257
Why wouldn't you just blow dry it straight?
为什么你不直接吹干它？

258
Why do you need to flat iron it?
为什么你需要拉直它？

259
Because a flat iron makes it more flat.
因为拉直器使它更平。

260
It makes your hair stick together more and it's much, much, much hotter than a blow dryer.
它使你的头发更紧密，温度比吹风机高得多。

261
Okay, so I guess if you use a blow dryer, then you have puffy hair.
好的，所以我想如果你使用吹风机，你的头发就会蓬松。

262
Or like the next word that she described, frizzy hair.
或者像她描述的下一个词，毛躁的头发。

263
Okay, so the adjective to describe this kind of hair is frizzy.
好的，所以形容这种头发的形容词是毛躁的。

264
For example, when it's very rainy, my hair is frizzy.
例如，当天气非常潮湿时，我的头发是毛躁的。

265
That means that it sticks out.
这意味着它会翘起来。

266
It's very thick and not straight.

269
It kind of inflates.
它有点膨胀。

270
That's right.
没错。

271
It's like a little balloon.
就像一个小气球。

272
But the verb here is to frizz.
但这里的动词是毛躁。

273
So my hair is frizzing.
所以我的头发在毛躁。

274
Okay.
