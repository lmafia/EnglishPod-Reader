62
An ounce is a kind of weight.

63
So like a kilogram or a gram or a pound.

But an ounce is a very, very small measurement.

67
But usually, for example, pounds and ounces go together, just like grams and kilograms.
但通常，例如，磅和盎司是一起的，就像克和千克一样。

83
You turn the handle and the door opens.

So a man or a woman can have fat on their hips, and this is called love handles.
所以一个男人或女人可以在他们的臀部有脂肪，这叫做赘肉。

86
Okay.
好吧。

87
So love handles.

88
It's a nice way of saying that extra little fat that people have on their sides.
这是一个说法，表示人们在侧面有的多余脂肪。

89
Alright.
好吧。

90
And now talking more specifically about words related to food, we have one that maybe most of you are familiar with.
现在更具体地谈谈与食物相关的词汇，我们有一个你们可能都熟悉的词。

91
Calories.
卡路里。

92
Calories.
卡路里。

93
So calorie is a measurement of energy in food.
所以卡路里是食物中能量的测量。

94
Right.
对。

95
And so a lot of women and some men too like to avoid eating many calories.
所以很多女性和一些男性也喜欢避免摄入过多的卡路里。

96
They say, oh, that Snickers bar that has 1,000 calories.
他们说，哦，那根士力架有1000卡路里。

97
That's right.

Actually, if you look at your food labels, it usually says that you should have a daily diet should include more or less 2,000 calories.
实际上，如果你查看你的食品标签，通常会说你每天的饮食应该包含大约2000卡路里。

99
Exactly.
正是。

100
Alright.
好的。

101
Another thing to avoid are saturated fats.
另一个需要避免的东西是饱和脂肪。

102
Okay, so there's fat and there's saturated fat.
好吧，脂肪和饱和脂肪是不同的。

103
Marco, what's the difference?
马尔科，区别是什么？

104
I have no idea.

105
Come on.
来吧。

106
There are two different types of fats.
有两种不同类型的脂肪。

107
Some of them are good for you.
有些对你有好处。

108
Your body needs fat, right?
你的身体需要脂肪，对吧？

109
Exactly.
正是如此。

110
But saturated fats are the ones that are more difficult for your body to absorb and to make them work for you.
但饱和脂肪是你身体更难吸收并利用的。

111
So usually they accumulate and that's why maybe they will, for example, make you a fatter.
所以通常它们会积累，这就是为什么它们可能会让你变胖。

112
So a lot of sweets have saturated fats.
所以很多甜食含有饱和脂肪。

113
Oily foods have saturated fats and it's good to avoid those.
油腻食物含有饱和脂肪，最好避免这些。

114
Right.
对。

115
And well, stay away from saturated fats and artificial flavors.
而且，远离饱和脂肪和人造香料。

116
So the word artificial can be used with many different things.
所以“人造”这个词可以用在很多不同的东西上。

117
It means fake, not natural.
它的意思是假的，不自然。

118
So you could say you have artificial flowers or artificial scents.
所以你可以说你有人造花或人造香味。

119
But in this case, we have artificial flavors.
但在这种情况下，我们有的是人造香料。

120
That means fake flavors.
这意味着假的味道。

121
It's orange flavored, but there's no oranges.
它是橙子味的，但里面没有橙子。

122
It never came from an orange.
它从来没有来自橙子。

123
So you have to be careful with these because in many food products, chemicals are used.
所以你必须小心这些，因为在许多食品中使用了化学物质。

124
Right, and sugars, for example.
对，还有糖，例如。

125
So as you said, if you want to make something taste like orange, maybe they will use different chemicals and sugars to make it taste like orange.
所以正如你所说，如果你想让某样东西尝起来像橙子，也许他们会使用不同的化学物质和糖来让它尝起来像橙子。

126
Exactly.
正是如此。

127
The last thing we have to avoid is this word cholesterol.
我们必须避免的最后一个词是胆固醇。

128
Cholesterol.
胆固醇。

129
Okay, so these are found, for example, when eggs have a lot of cholesterol.
好吧，这些通常在鸡蛋中含有很多胆固醇。

130
Or even just meats in general, like red meat.
或者一般的肉类，比如红肉。

131
And so people with heart problems are told to avoid cholesterol because it can actually, it can prevent the blood going to your heart.
所以有心脏问题的人被告知要避免胆固醇，因为它实际上会阻止血液流向你的心脏。

132
It blocks up your heart.
它会堵塞你的心脏。

133
So cholesterol is another bad one.
所以胆固醇是另一个坏东西。

134
All right, so all of these words are nouns and they're related to dieting and to food.
好吧，这些词都是名词，和饮食及食物有关。

135
So I think we should listen to this dialogue again and keep a lookout for these words.
所以我认为我们应该再听一遍这个对话，留意这些词。

136

But that the important thing is that I watch what I eat.
但重要的是我注意我吃的东西。

162

219
So these are some pretty healthy tips, right?
所以这些都是一些相当健康的建议，对吧？

220
Watch what you eat and don't starve yourself.
注意你吃的东西，不要饿自己。

221
Absolutely.
绝对是。

222
Starving yourself I think is, well, obviously very unhealthy.
饿自己我认为，显然是非常不健康的。

223
To starve, to die of starvation, that's the noun.
饿死，死于饥饿，这是名词。

224
Not a very pretty way to go, so... I've actually also heard that people that start to eat less, right, to maybe just eat once a day, their body actually thinks that there isn't much food around, so they start to store up these fats and these calories energy instead of releasing them normally.
这不是一种很好的方式去世，所以……我实际上也听说过，开始少吃的人，可能一天只吃一次，他们的身体实际上会认为食物不多，所以他们开始储存这些脂肪和热量，而不是正常释放它们。

225
So instead of actually losing weight, you actually gain weight because the moment that you eat, your body stores everything.
所以实际上不是减肥，而是因为你吃的那一刻，你的身体储存了一切。

226
Exactly.
正是如此。

227
So instead of getting rid of those good fats, your body stores them with the saturated fats.
所以不是去掉那些好脂肪，而是你的身体把它们和饱和脂肪一起储存。

228
Yeah.
是的。

229
And you are doing the opposite to your body that you should be doing.
你对身体做的事情正好相反。

230
So the best recommendation that I've always heard is to avoid eating too much red meat, balance your diet out, eat lots of fruit as well, have those good sugars, and avoid artificial foods.
所以我一直听到的最佳建议是避免吃太多红肉，均衡饮食，多吃水果，摄入好的糖分，避免人工食品。

231
Drink a lot of water.
多喝水。

232
Drink a lot of water and exercise.
多喝水并锻炼。

233
Exercise, yeah.
锻炼，是的。

234
This is the key thing.
这是关键。

235
I think many people rely only on dieting or like eating less, but actually nothing can take its place more than exercise.
我认为很多人只依赖节食或少吃，但实际上没有什么能比锻炼更有效。

236
And exercise is really great because it tones those muscles, so once you actually lose the weight, you feel good, you have muscles, you have more energy, and it helps you sleep.
而且锻炼真的很好，因为它能塑造肌肉，所以一旦你真正减掉体重，你会感觉良好，有肌肉，精力更充沛，还能帮助你睡眠。

237
Right.
对。

238
