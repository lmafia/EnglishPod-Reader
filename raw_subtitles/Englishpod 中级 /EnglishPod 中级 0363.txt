She said she was tired of me not Manning up and being more independent, which I think is all a bunch of crap.
她说她厌倦了我不成熟和不独立，我觉得这都是胡说八道。

Well, you still live with your parents, so she does have a point.

是的，但你快40了。

16
Plus, you make good money, so there's really no excuse.
而且你赚得不错，所以真的没有借口。

17
It's just simply because you're a mama's boy.

18
Whatever, dude.
随便你说吧，兄弟。

24
Let's agree to disagree.

25
All right, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

26
So now let's take a look at some language on language takeaway.
现在让我们看看一些语言要点。

27
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

28
The first verb we have here is to break up.
我们这里的第一个动词是“分手”。

29
So we heard the guy say, why did your girlfriend break up with you?
所以我们听到那个男孩说，你女朋友为什么和你分手？

30
That's right, so this is a phrasal verb, and to break up in a relationship or in a romantic sense means to end a relationship.
没错，这是一个短语动词，分手在关系或浪漫意义上意味着结束一段关系。

31
So if you break up with your girlfriend, it means you end the relationship.
所以如果你和女朋友分手，意味着你结束了这段关系。

32
That's right, so you think about breaking something, it goes into pieces.
没错，想象一下分开，东西会碎成碎片。

33
Well, in a relationship, it means you both leave each other, you go your separate ways, and so you can say, he broke up with me, or we broke up.
在一段关系中，这意味着你们彼此离开，各自走自己的路，所以你可以说，他和我分手了，或者我们分手了。

34
That's right, and the reason his girlfriend broke up with him is because she said he was not independent, so she wanted him to be more independent.
没错，他女朋友和他分手的原因是因为她说他不独立，所以她希望他更独立。

35
So independent means that you do things on your own.
所以独立意味着你自己做事情。

36
When you're, you know, you do things alone, you don't expect other people to help you.
当你一个人做事情时，你不指望其他人来帮助你。

37
You don't depend on other people.
你不依赖其他人。

38
Exactly, so you can say, he's very independent, he loves to travel alone.
正是如此，所以你可以说，他非常独立，他喜欢一个人旅行。

39
Okay, so it means that you don't really need other people's help, I guess, right?
好的，这意味着你不需要其他人的帮助，对吧？

40
Exactly.
正是如此。

41
Okay, all right, so he's not really very independent, and well, his friend agrees.
好的，所以他并不是很独立，而他的朋友同意这一点。

42
He says, well, you know what?
他说，嗯，你知道吗？

43
I think she has a point.
我觉得她说得对。

44
To have a point means to say something that the other person agrees with.
有道理意味着说出其他人同意的事情。

45
Okay, so you could say, he has a point, I agree with him.
好的，所以你可以说，他有道理，我同意他。

46
That's a good argument.
这是一个很好的论点。

47
Right, so if you, if somebody says something and you agree with that when you say, yeah, you have a point, it means you agree with the argument, you agree with what that person says.
对，所以如果有人说了什么，你同意时说，嗯，你说得对，这意味着你同意这个论点，你同意那个人所说的。

48
All right, and now lastly, because he lives with his parents, his friend is saying that he should move out.
好的，最后，因为他和父母住在一起，他的朋友说他应该搬出去。

49
You should move out.
你应该搬出去。

50
So here's another phrasal verb, to move out.
这是另一个短语动词，搬出去。

51
This means that you leave the house and you find a new house.
这意味着你离开房子，找到一个新家。

52
So when you're with your parents, you want to move out.
所以当你和父母在一起时，你想搬出去。

53
That means you don't live with your parents anymore, but you find your own house.
这意味着你不再和父母住在一起，而是找到自己的房子。

54
That's right.
没错。

55
So, well, in general, when you find your own house, when you leave, and your current place of living, that's moving out, right?
所以，总的来说，当你找到自己的房子，离开你现在的居住地，这就是搬出去，对吧？

56
That's right, so if I'm leaving the city, I move out of my house, and then when I arrive in a new city, I move in to a new house.
没错，所以如果我离开这个城市，我就搬出我的房子，然后当我到达新城市时，我就搬进新房子。

57
Oh, very good.
哦，非常好。

58
So to move out and to move in.
所以搬出去和搬进来。

59
They go hand in hand.
它们是相辅相成的。

60
