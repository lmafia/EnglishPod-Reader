And we're on the road today.
今天我们在路上。

5
We're traveling a little bit.
我们正在旅行。

6
That's right.
没错。

7
Today we have a lesson that was requested by one of our users.
今天我们有一节课是由我们的用户请求的。

8
And I think it's a very handy lesson.
我认为这是一节非常实用的课程。

9
If we're traveling, we are buying tickets at a train station.
如果我们在旅行，我们会在火车站买票。

10
That's right.
没错。

11
So I personally love traveling by train.
我个人非常喜欢坐火车旅行。

12
I think it's a very romantic way to see different countries, different places.
我觉得这是看不同国家、不同地方的非常浪漫的方式。

13
We're going to learn all about how to get tickets and how to talk about different parts of a train.
我们将学习如何购票以及如何谈论火车的不同部分。

14
So let's first listen to our dialogue.
首先，让我们听听对话。

15
Hi, I would like to purchase a one-way ticket to Brussels, please.
你好，我想买一张去布鲁塞尔的单程票。

16
Certainly, sir.
当然，先生。

17
This is our train schedule.
这是我们的火车时刻表。

18
We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at 9 P.M.
我们每天早上都有一班快车，晚上9点有一班过夜列车。

19
How long does it take to get there?
到那里需要多长时间？

20
About 12 hours.
大约12小时。

21
We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train.
我们目前只有快车的一等票可供出售。

22
If you'd like, you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train, which is a bit less expensive.
如果您愿意，可以选择过夜列车的卧铺，价格稍微便宜一些。

23
Yeah, I think that's the best option.
是的，我觉得这是最好的选择。

24
Do you serve food on a train?
火车上提供餐食吗？

25
12 hours is such a long time.
12小时真是太长了。

26
Yes, of course.
是的，当然。

27
There is a dining car towards the end of the train where they serve meals at all times.
火车后面有一个餐车，随时提供餐食。

28
We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers.
我们为所有乘客提供免费的水和咖啡。

29
Great.
太好了。

30
I'll take it.
我就要这个。

31
Here you are, sir.
给您，先生。

32
Your train leaves from platform number 9 at 9 on the dot.
您的火车在9点整从9号站台出发。

33
Remember to be here at least 30 minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train.
请记得至少提前30分钟到达，否则您可能会错过火车。

34
I understand.
我明白了。

35
Thank you very much.
非常感谢。

36
Have a great trip.
祝您旅途愉快。

37
Alright, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

38
So now we're going to take a look at a couple of words that we've picked out for you on Language Takeaway.
现在我们将看看我们为您挑选的一些单词，来自Language Takeaway。

39
Language Takeaway.
Language Takeaway。

40
So there are many different kinds of tickets you can purchase, you can buy for your train journey.
您可以购买多种不同类型的票，适用于您的火车旅行。

41
The first count we're going to talk about is maybe the fastest.
我们要讨论的第一种票可能是最快的。

42
This is called an express train.
这叫做快车。

43
That's right.
没错。

44
So as the name says, it's an express train.
正如名字所示，这是快车。

45
That means it's a very fast train.
这意味着它是一列非常快的火车。

46
And it depends because in different places, sometimes they call it the fast train, sometimes they call it the express train.
这取决于不同地方，有时他们称之为快车，有时称之为特快列车。

47
But basically the idea is that it's a very fast train.
但基本上这个概念是它是一列非常快的火车。

48
And it's fast usually because it stops very few times.
通常它很快是因为停靠的次数很少。

49
For example, if we want to go on the Paris to Berlin train, it won't stop in every single town, it will probably only stop a couple of times.
例如，如果我们想乘坐巴黎到柏林的火车，它不会在每个小镇停靠，可能只会停几次。

50
Exactly.
正是如此。

51
So apart from the express trains that usually they'll go in the daytime, we have an overnight train.
除了通常在白天行驶的快车外，我们还有过夜列车。

52
Overnight trains are very fun, or at least they can be fun if you have a comfortable place to sleep.
过夜列车非常有趣，或者至少如果您有一个舒适的地方可以睡觉，它们可以很有趣。

53
Basically the idea is you get on the train at night and you sleep on the train and you get off in the morning.
基本上，您在晚上上车，晚上在火车上睡觉，早上下车。

54
That's right.
没错。

55
It's actually a very popular way of traveling, especially if you're on a budget because, well, you're basically saving yourself one night of spending the night at a hotel.
这实际上是一种非常受欢迎的旅行方式，特别是如果您预算有限，因为，嗯，您基本上节省了一晚的酒店费用。

56
That's right.
没错。

57
So you're going to have to find a place to sleep if you're taking the overnight train.
所以如果您乘坐过夜列车，您需要找到一个地方睡觉。

58
There are usually different options.
通常有不同的选择。

59
The most uncomfortable is usually a seat, like a hard seat, but there are oftentimes special cars on a train where you can sleep for these overnight trips.
最不舒服的通常是座位，比如硬座，但通常火车上会有专门的车厢供您在这些过夜旅行中睡觉。

60
What are those called?
那些叫什么？

61
That's right, and those are called a sleeper.
没错，那些叫做卧铺。

62
Sleeper cars, or you choose a sleeper seat.
卧铺车厢，或者您选择一个卧铺座位。

63
Right, so that's pretty easy to remember.
对，所以这很容易记住。

64
Sleep, sleeper.
睡觉，卧铺。

65
The sleeper seats are the seats that fold back like you're lying down, but of course most places like China and India and Vietnam, for example, have actual cars that have beds in them.
卧铺座位是可以向后折叠的座位，就像躺下，但当然大多数地方，比如中国、印度和越南，实际上有带床的车厢。

66
Right, right, yeah.
对，对，是的。

67
So you can, as the name says, you can actually sleep on this train.
所以您可以，正如名字所示，实际上可以在这列火车上睡觉。

68
Now if you're going to buy tickets, you're not going to find a sleeper train on an express train or a train that travels during the day.
现在如果您要买票，您不会在快车或白天行驶的火车上找到卧铺。

69
These are only available at night, usually.
这些通常只在晚上提供。

70
That's right.
没错。

71
So sleeper car is what you want to look for if you're traveling overnight.
所以如果您在过夜旅行，您要寻找的就是卧铺车厢。

72
And in those cases, you oftentimes get hungry.
在这种情况下，您通常会感到饥饿。

73
You need to eat.
您需要吃东西。

74
So where do you go to eat?
那么您去哪里吃？

75
That's right.
没错。

76
We're going to look for the dining car on the train.
我们要在火车上寻找餐车。

77
Okay, so think about the word dining room.
好的，想想餐厅这个词。

78
Dining room, dining car, this means the place where you eat.
餐厅，餐车，这意味着您吃饭的地方。

79
That's right.
没错。

80
So we're going to look for a dining car, and it's usually in the front of the train, I think, and you can just go and get a quick meal over there.
所以我们要寻找餐车，通常在火车的前面，我想，您可以去那里快速吃一顿。

81
That's right.
没错。

82
Dining car.
餐车。

83
And finally, we have another very important word here.
最后，我们还有另一个非常重要的词。

84
It's all about getting on and off the train.
这与上下火车有关。

85
So where do you do that?
那么您在哪里做到这一点？

86
Well, you go to the platform, the specific platform where your train is leaving.
好吧，您要去您火车出发的特定站台。

87
So in this case, this guy has to go to platform number nine.
在这种情况下，这个人必须去9号站台。

88
Okay, so usually that means that there is a cement or a stone block where you stand, the train comes to the station, people get off, you get on.
好的，通常这意味着有一个水泥或石块的地方，您站在那里，火车到达车站，人们下车，您上车。

89
So the place where that all happens is the platform.
所以这一切发生的地方就是站台。

90
That's right.
没错。

91
So remember that in airplanes or in airports, usually you look for a terminal.
所以请记住，在飞机或机场，通常您寻找的是航站楼。

92
For train stations, you're looking for a platform.
对于火车站，您要寻找的是站台。

93
All right.
好的。

94
And that number is going to be very important.
而且那个号码会非常重要。

95
So look at your ticket and find out which platform your train will be arriving or departing from.
所以查看您的票，找出您的火车将从哪个站台到达或出发。

96
That's right.
没错。

97
Okay, so now why don't we review these words?
好的，现在我们来复习这些单词吧。

98
Let's listen to the dialogue again.
让我们再听一遍对话。

99
And we'll be back in a bit.
我们稍后再见。

100
Hi, I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels, please.
你好，我想买一张去布鲁塞尔的单程票。

101

当然，先生。

102
This is our train schedule.
这是我们的火车时刻表。

103

我们每天早上都有一班快车，晚上9点有一班过夜列车。

104
How long does it take to get there?

105
About 12 hours.
大约12小时。

106
We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train.
我们目前只有快车的一等票可供出售。

107
If you'd like you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train, which is a bit less expensive.

108

是的，我觉得这是最好的选择。

109
Do you serve food on a train?
火车上提供食物吗？

110
12 hours is such a long time.
12小时真是太长了。

111

我们为所有乘客提供免费的水和咖啡。

113

117
I understand.
我明白了。

118
Thank you very much.
非常感谢。

119
Have a great trip.
祝您旅途愉快。

120
Okay, so we've got some really great phrases today on Fluency Builder, not that many of them, but they're very useful.
好的，今天在流利表达中我们有一些非常好的短语，虽然不多，但非常实用。

121
The first one is a kind of ticket you can buy.
第一个是您可以购买的一种票。

122
That's right.
没错。

123
We're looking for a one way ticket to Brussels.
我们在找一张去布鲁塞尔的单程票。

124
Okay, so a one way ticket means that you go to Brussels, but you don't come home.
好的，单程票意味着您去布鲁塞尔，但不回家。

125
Maybe you have a flight later or you have a car waiting for you.
也许您稍后有航班，或者有车在等您。

126
You don't need a return ticket on that train.
您不需要那班火车的返程票。

127
One way ticket is the opposite of a round trip ticket.
单程票是往返票的相对概念。

128
That's right.
没错。

129
So usually, for example, if you live in New York and you're going on vacation, you're going to buy a round trip ticket because you need to go back to your to your city.
所以通常来说，例如，如果您住在纽约，去度假，您会买一张往返票，因为您需要回到您的城市。

130
But in this case, we're getting a one way ticket.
但在这种情况下，我们要买一张单程票。

131
So we're just buying a ticket that will only take us there.
所以我们只买一张只带我们去那里的票。

132
It's not going to bring us back.
它不会把我们带回来。

133
Okay, one way ticket.
好的，单程票。

134
And after that, we have a good question.
然后我们有一个好问题。

135
This is something we can ask in many, many different situations.
这是我们可以在许多不同情况下问的问题。

136
Here, the person buying the ticket wants to know, how long does it take to get there?
在这里，买票的人想知道，到那里需要多长时间？

137
He's talking about Brussels.
他在说布鲁塞尔。

138
That's right.
没错。

139
So let's take a look at this structure.
那么我们来看看这个结构。

140
We can say, how long does it take to and then we can add another verb there.
我们可以说，到……需要多长时间，然后我们可以加上另一个动词。

141
So for example, we want to know the amount of time it is going to require.
例如，我们想知道需要多少时间。

142
For example, here we are asking how long does it take to get there in this case to Brussels, we are asking how much time is needed to go to Brussels.
例如，在这里我们在问，到布鲁塞尔需要多长时间。

143
But what if we change the last part?
但如果我们改变最后一部分呢？

144
Well, there's anything we could say anything here, we could say how long does it take to bake a pizza?
嗯，这里可以说任何事情，我们可以说，烤一个比萨饼需要多长时间？

145
Or for example, Marco, how long does it take for you to do your hair in the morning?
或者例如，马尔科，早上你做头发需要多长时间？

146
Like 20 seconds.
大约20秒。

147
Not very long.
不太长。

148
Not very long.
不太长。

149
You could even change the name of the place you're going to.
您甚至可以改变您要去的地方的名称。

150
So how long does it take to get to Beijing?
那么到北京需要多长时间？

151
Exactly.
正是如此。

152
So just remember this structure when you want to ask the amount of time needed.
所以当您想询问所需时间时，请记住这个结构。

153
Of course, there are other ways and sometimes it's very common to make a little bit of mistakes saying, how much time to Beijing or something like this?
当然，还有其他方式，有时说“到北京需要多少时间”这样的表达是很常见的错误。

154
Or how many hours?
或者“多少小时？”

155
We don't really say that in English.
我们在英语中并不这样说。

156
We say how much time so how much time does it take?
我们说“多少时间”，所以“需要多少时间？”

157
All right.
好的。

158
And what about when the when when the person that's selling the tickets said, Okay, the train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot.
那么当售票员说，好的，火车在9点整从9号站台出发时，怎么样？

159
Okay, so I'm not really sure where this idea of a dot comes from.
好的，我不太确定这个“整”的概念来自哪里。

160
But I think it has to do with clocks.
但我认为这与时钟有关。

161
So basically, when you look at a clock, and and all of a sudden the hand comes to 12.
所以基本上，当您看着时钟，突然指针指向12。

162
So it's nine o'clock, the hand is on the 12 that is on the dot.
所以是9点，指针在12上，那就是“整”。

163
That means exactly.
这意味着准确。

164
Okay, so the train is leaving at 900 not 930 not 915.
好的，所以火车在9点出发，不是9点30分，也不是9点15分。

165
It's leaving exactly at nine o'clock.
它在9点整出发。

166
So we can also say this in normal speech when we're talking to our friends, I could say Marco, we're going to leave at six on the dot any later and we'll miss the movie.
所以我们在与朋友交谈时也可以这样说，我可以说马尔科，我们将在6点整出发，晚了就会错过电影。

167
Exactly.
正是如此。

168
So but when you say on the you're usually emphasizing that it leaves promptly, it's not going to be late.
所以当你说“整”的时候，通常是在强调它准时出发，不会迟到。

169
And you're kind of emphasizing a person to be on time.
你在强调一个人要准时。

170
Yes, please don't be late because so 901 or in my case, 604.
是的，请不要迟到，因为9点01分，或者在我这里是6点04分。

171
These are not okay, because they're too late.
这些都不行，因为太晚了。

172
Exactly.
正是如此。

173
So if I say I'm going to pick you up at four o'clock on the dot usually means I don't really want to wait.
所以如果我说我将在4点整接你，通常意味着我不想等。

174
So please be ready at four.
所以请在4点准备好。

175
Alright, so on the dot.
好的，所以“整”。

176
Alright, so now let's listen to our dialogue for the last time.
好的，现在我们最后再听一遍对话。

177
And we'll be back to talk with you a little bit more.
然后我们会回来和您多聊聊。

178

203
Well, I like that trains are kind of slow.
嗯，我喜欢火车的速度比较慢。

204
So when you're... well, many trains are slow.
所以当你……很多火车都很慢。

205
Some trains, as we said, like express trains are faster.
有些火车，比如我们说的特快列车，速度更快。

206
But if you're traveling in a new place, it's a wonderful way to see the country because maybe you're going from one city to another city.
但如果你在一个新地方旅行，这是一个很好的方式去看这个国家，因为你可能是从一个城市到另一个城市。

207
Well, it's nice to see what's in between cities.
嗯，看到城市之间的风景很好。

208
So that's why I like to be on trains.
所以这就是我喜欢坐火车的原因。

209
I actually also really enjoy taking the overnight trains because I sometimes get a little bit uncomfortable if I travel for too long, for example, on an airplane or a car.
我其实也很喜欢坐过夜火车，因为如果我在飞机或汽车上旅行太久，有时会感到不太舒服。

210
So if I fall asleep and I wake up where I wanted to go, it's really nice.
所以如果我睡着了，醒来时正好到达目的地，那真是太好了。

211
Well, and I think it's nice also to be kind of rolled asleep, you know, lulled asleep by the train.
嗯，我觉得被火车摇晃着入睡也很好。

212
Have you had any like very memorable train experiences?

213
Traveling around, I have met some interesting people and actually they, you know, local people.
在旅行中，我遇到了一些有趣的人，实际上他们是当地人。

他们开始和你交谈，对你这个外国人感到好奇，试图了解你，甚至给你一些建议。

215
And if you don't speak the language, it's even a little bit more interesting because you're trying to communicate and you pick up a lot of words.
如果你不会说他们的语言，那就更有趣了，因为你在尝试交流，并且学到很多单词。

216
