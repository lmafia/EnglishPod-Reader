11
Have you ever been to one of these places?

12
Yes, a shooting range.

It's a place, like you say, and it's a place where you can fire your weapons or you can use guns safely, so you don't kill anyone or you don't hurt someone.
这是一个地方，正如你所说的，可以安全地使用武器或开枪，这样就不会伤害到任何人。

14
No, basically, yeah, it's a place to practice shooting.
不，基本上，是的，这是一个练习射击的地方。

15
So maybe, for example, if you want to practice how to shoot guns, you go to this place and they have special things to help you improve your shooting abilities.
所以例如，如果你想练习如何开枪，你可以去这个地方，他们有特别的设施来帮助你提高射击能力。

16
Usually, these are very, very secure.
通常，这些地方非常安全。

17
They have guards and things because you don't want to give the guns out to anybody.
他们有保安等，因为你不想把枪交给任何人。

18
That's right.
没错。

19
But let's listen to today's dialogue about a shooting range and find out what kinds of guns they have.
但让我们听听今天关于射击场的对话，看看他们有什么样的枪。

36
Don't get carried away.

46
Let's do it!
我们开始吧！

47
Alright, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

48
So, obviously, this guy was very excited about using these weapons.
所以，显然，这家伙对使用这些武器非常兴奋。

49
And you may have heard that we're using this word, weapons.
你可能听说过我们使用这个词，武器。

50
It's basically all of these things.
基本上就是这些东西。

51
I guess anything that can be used in defense or hurt someone.
我想任何可以用来防卫或伤害某人的东西。

52
Yes, anything that can be used to hurt someone is a weapon.
是的，任何可以用来伤害某人的东西都是武器。

53
So, a knife can be a weapon, not just guns.
所以，刀也可以是武器，不仅仅是枪。

54
Guns are a kind of weapon.
枪是一种武器。

55
That's right.
没错。

56
So, taking a look at our first type of gun or our first type of weapon, we have a 9mm pistol.
所以，看看我们的第一种枪或第一种武器，我们有一把9毫米手枪。

57
Okay, so the weapon is the pistol.
好的，所以武器是手枪。

58
And the pistol is basically a handgun.
手枪基本上是一种手持武器。

59
But it comes in different sizes.
但它有不同的尺寸。

60
So, that's what the 9mm refers to.
所以，这就是9毫米的意思。

61
That's right.
没错。

62
That's the size of the projectile that will come out of the weapon.
这是从武器中发射出的弹丸的大小。

63
And a pistol, as you said, it's a handgun.
而手枪，正如你所说，是一种手持武器。

64
It's usually small.
通常很小。

65
And it can fit in your hand.
它可以放在你的手中。

66
So, you can use just one hand to use this weapon.
所以，你可以用一只手来使用这个武器。

67
Okay, so there's a similar handgun that's a little bit bigger.
好的，所以有一种类似的手枪，稍微大一点。

68
That's called a revolver.
那叫做转轮手枪。

69
That's right, a revolver.
没错，转轮手枪。

70
So, this one has a revolving chamber.
所以，这个有一个旋转的弹膛。

71
So, you kind of see this in the old western movies when they would have six bullets, right?
所以，你在老西部电影中会看到这种情况，他们会有六发子弹，对吧？

72
And they, like, swing their guns into their side holsters.
他们会把枪摆进侧面枪套里。

73
Yeah.
是的。

74
Well, yeah, that's right.
嗯，是的，没错。

75
The revolver refers to the... Well, to revolve, it means to move around, to spin.
转轮手枪指的是... 嗯，旋转，意味着转动，旋转。

76
That's right.
没错。

77
And so, the place with the bullets basically spins after you shoot the gun.
所以，子弹的地方在你开枪后基本上会旋转。

78
That's right.
没错。

79
So, that's why it's called a revolver.
所以，这就是为什么它叫转轮手枪。

80
Unlike the pistol, the pistol will usually not really have a revolver.
与手枪不同，手枪通常不会有转轮。

81
It will have a magazine.
它会有一个弹匣。

82
Okay?
好吗？

83
Now, moving on to our next type of weapon.
现在，继续我们的下一种武器。

84
We have the very famous machine gun.
我们有非常著名的机枪。

85
That's the one that shoots off really fast.
那是那种发射得非常快的。

86
And so, basically, it's called a machine gun because it's automatically releasing all of these bullets at once.
所以，基本上，它被称为机枪，因为它会自动同时发射所有这些子弹。

87
You just pull the trigger and many, many, many bullets come out.
你只需拉动扳机，很多很多子弹就会出来。

88
That's right.
没错。

89
So, in a pistol or in a revolver, usually you have to press the trigger once and it shoots only once.
所以，在手枪或转轮手枪中，通常你必须按一次扳机，它只会发射一次。

90
But in the machine gun, you can keep it pressed and all these bullets will start flying out.
但在机枪中，你可以保持按下，所有这些子弹就会开始飞出。

91
Very, very dangerous.
非常非常危险。

92
Very dangerous.
非常危险。

93
Okay.
好的。

94
So, now moving on to the next one, we also took a look at a shotgun.
所以，现在继续到下一个，我们还看了一下霰弹枪。

95
Okay, this is... well, this is not the biggest gun we're going to talk about today, but it's a very large gun, very long, and you have to use two hands to hold it.
好的，这个... 嗯，这不是我们今天要谈论的最大枪，但它是一种非常大的枪，非常长，你必须用双手来握住它。

96
This is what you usually use when you go hunting, right?
这通常是你去打猎时使用的，对吧？

97
That's right.
没错。

98
So, as you said, it's a very long gun.
所以，正如你所说，这是一个非常长的枪。

99
It's very loud and it doesn't really shoot bullets.
它非常响，而且实际上并不发射子弹。

100
It shoots little pellets, little cartridges that are filled with little rocks, for example.
它发射小颗粒，小弹药，里面装有小石头，例如。

101
And that's what it shoots.
这就是它的射击方式。

102
And this is why it's not very precise, like a machine gun or a handgun, but it does a lot of damage.
这就是为什么它不太精确，像机枪或手枪，但造成很大伤害。

103
Absolutely.
绝对如此。

104
And what's something else that does a lot of damage?
还有什么东西造成很大伤害？

105
Our next gun will do that.
我们的下一把枪会做到这一点。

106
Well, this guy got a little bit excited and he said he wanted to use a rocket launcher.
好吧，这家伙有点兴奋，他说他想用火箭发射器。

107
Okay, so you know what a rocket is?
好的，你知道火箭是什么吗？

108
A rocket is something that's basically a projectile that goes into the sky and can basically blow up big buildings or cars.
火箭基本上是一个发射到天空的弹丸，可以摧毁大楼或汽车。

109
Mm-hmm.
嗯哼。

110
That's right, and that's what a rocket launcher is.
没错，这就是火箭发射器。

111
Now, maybe you've heard of the word bazooka.
现在，也许你听说过“巴祖卡”这个词。

112
A bazooka is a type of rocket launcher.
巴祖卡是一种火箭发射器。

113
It's the one that's very, very, very wide and it's circular, and you usually see it in movies like Rambo we talked about, where Rambo will hold it on one shoulder.
它非常宽，呈圆形，通常在我们谈论的《第一滴血》等电影中看到，兰博会把它扛在一边肩膀上。

114
It's so big, and the rocket shoots out and can destroy huge buildings.
它非常大，火箭发射出去可以摧毁巨大的建筑。

115
That's exactly right.
正是如此。

116
So that's why it's called a rocket launcher.
所以这就是为什么它叫火箭发射器。

117
Now, for our last type of weapon, we have a flame thrower.
现在，对于我们最后一种武器，我们有火焰喷射器。

118
Okay, well, a flame refers to fire.
好吧，火焰指的是火。

119
So fire has flames.
所以火有火焰。

120
Those are the parts that kind of come up on a fire, the red and orange.
那些是火焰上升的部分，红色和橙色。

121
And a flame thrower is a device, is a weapon, that will shoot flames, not bullets.
火焰喷射器是一种设备，是一种武器，可以喷射火焰，而不是子弹。

122
Yeah, exactly.
是的，正是如此。

123
It was very popular back in World War II to actually shoot the flamethrower into bunkers or into holes, because then, you know, this is how you can get people out of there.
在二战期间，火焰喷射器非常受欢迎，实际上是用来喷射到碉堡或洞里，因为这样可以把人赶出来。

124
And I think flamethrowers are used now to some sort of degree, like to fumigate sometimes or to burn weeds when you're in a field.
我认为火焰喷射器现在在某种程度上仍然被使用，比如有时用来熏蒸或在田地里烧除杂草。

125
Right, they're not really used as weapons anymore, although I think I've seen a number of them in action movies.
对，它们不再真正作为武器使用，尽管我认为我在动作电影中见过很多。

126
Really?
真的？

127
Yeah, in action movies, of course.
是的，当然是在动作电影中。

128
So we have a lot of guns, a lot of different types of weapons.
所以我们有很多枪，很多不同类型的武器。

129
Why don't we go back to the dialogue, let's listen to it again, and we'll be back soon with Fluency Builder.

157
So this first phrase comes from the beginning of today's dialogue when Nick is saying, well, I'm not doing much, I'm just heading over to the shooting range.
所以这个短语来自今天对话的开头，当尼克说，我没做什么，只是去射击场。

158
That's right, so we know what shooting range is, but when he says I'm heading over to the shooting range.
没错，所以我们知道射击场是什么，但当他说我去射击场时。

159
Well, this can be confusing because to head over has nothing to do with the head on your body.

It means I'm going Just another way of saying going to, right?

That's right, so I'm going to my friend's house this afternoon.
