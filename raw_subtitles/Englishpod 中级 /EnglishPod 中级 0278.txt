The first one is trade-in, actually.

This is something that the man says when he goes to the car lot.

43
So this is something that you do in America or other places when you have a car already but you want a new car.
这在美国或其他地方是常见的，当你已经有一辆车但想要一辆新车时。

44
And so the car lot, the place where you can buy the car, they usually give you some money for your old car and you can spend that money on your new car.
所以车场，您可以购买汽车的地方，通常会给您一些钱用于旧车，您可以用这笔钱购买新车。

45
That's right.
没错。

46
So basically you give them your old car plus some extra cash and then you can get a new car.
所以基本上，您给他们旧车加上一些额外现金，然后您就可以得到新车。

47
So that's basically what a trade-in is.
这就是置换的基本概念。

48
And well, as you said, we had a lot of features on this car of the Ford Focus.
正如您所说，我们提到了Ford Focus这辆车的许多特点。

49
First of all, dual-side airbags.

53
But airbags are what's important in this phrase.

Airbags do what exactly, Marco?
气囊到底有什么作用，Marco？

55
They protect you from hitting the front part of the car.
它们保护您免受撞击汽车前部的伤害。

56
So maybe out of the steering wheel, a bag will inflate if you crash.
所以如果您发生碰撞，气囊会从方向盘中充气。

57
So it will prevent you from hitting the steering wheel and getting hurt.
这样可以防止您撞到方向盘而受伤。

58
It's like a big balloon and it protects you from damaging your body.

59
That's right.
没错。

60
So it has two airbags for the passenger and for the driver.

61
All right.
好的。

62
So after that, we also heard about a number of things that are power.
然后，我们还听到了许多与动力相关的东西。

63
Power steering, power windows.
动力转向，电动窗。

64
So what does power steering do?
那么动力转向有什么作用？

65
Power steering, or also called assisted steering, it allows you to turn your car with less effort.
动力转向，或称为辅助转向，它使您可以更轻松地转动汽车。

66
So maybe you've driven a car that didn't have power steering, and so you really have to struggle when you're turning the car, especially if you're parking.
也许您开过没有动力转向的车，所以在转弯时您真的需要费力，尤其是停车时。

67
So you have to turn the wheel and turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it to turn.
所以您必须不停地转动方向盘。

68
But a power steering makes it more automatic.
但动力转向使其更自动化。

69
That's right.
没错。

70
So it's very easy to turn left or right.
所以左转或右转都很容易。

71
That's right.
没错。

72
And the same thing goes for power windows.
电动窗也是一样。

73
So maybe your car doesn't have electric windows.
所以也许您的车没有电动窗。

74
So you have to do it manually with a little lever.
所以您必须用一个小杠杆手动操作。

75
It's a turn it around and around and around.
这是转来转去。

76
But instead with power windows, you just push a button and the window goes down or up.
但使用电动窗，您只需按一个按钮，窗户就会升降。

77
That's right.
没错。

78
And actually, as well, another feature for the windows, we have tinted windows.
事实上，窗户的另一个特点是深色窗户。

82
It's protected from the sun.

So tinted sunglasses, for example, can be very dark.
例如，深色太阳镜可以非常黑。

But tinted windows on a car are black.
但汽车上的深色窗户是黑色的。

85
They don't let much sunlight in so you don't get blinded by the sun or so other people can't see you from outside.
它们不让太多阳光进入，这样您就不会被阳光刺眼，或者其他人无法从外面看到您。

Usually limousines, you will see all limousines have tinted windows.
