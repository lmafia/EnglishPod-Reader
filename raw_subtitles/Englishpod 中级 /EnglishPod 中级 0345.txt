Let's take a look at language takeaway.

Alright, first of all, in today's dialogue, we heard a lot about this person called a personal trainer.
首先，在今天的对话中，我们听到了很多关于私人教练的内容。

34
What does a personal trainer do, Marco?
私人教练的工作是什么，Marco？

35
Basically, you have a person that is your coach, the person that guides you and teaches you how to work out or what you should do.
基本上，你有一个人是你的教练，指导你并教你如何锻炼或你应该做什么。

36
Alright, so personal means it's just for me.

37
This person is only helping me.
这个人只是在帮助我。

38
And a trainer is someone who, like you say, gives me guidance.
而教练是像你说的，给我指导的人。

39
So a personal trainer is someone who will work with me every day or maybe one time a week to really get the most out of my workout.
所以私人教练是一个每天或每周一次和我一起锻炼的人，以便充分利用我的锻炼。

40
That's right.
没错。

41
So that is a personal trainer.

42
And as we said, he's going to help us to build muscle.
正如我们所说，他会帮助我们增肌。

43
We want to build muscle when we go to the gym.
我们去健身房时想要增肌。

44
Alright, so this is an interesting one because the verb is not to grow or to make.
好的，这个有趣，因为动词不是生长或制造。

45
The verb is to build.
动词是建立。

46
So I have muscles, but I want my muscles to get bigger, so I go to build muscles at the gym.
所以我有肌肉，但我想让我的肌肉变大，所以我去健身房增肌。

You might even hear this phrase, a body builder.
你甚至可能会听到这个短语，健美运动员。

49

So you don't get muscle, you don't create muscle, you build muscle.
所以你不是获得肌肉，也不是创造肌肉，而是建立肌肉。

52
And alongside with muscles, not only do you get them big, but you also get muscle tone.
除了肌肉，你不仅让它们变大，还能获得肌肉线条。

53
Alright, so muscle tone basically means definition.
好的，所以肌肉线条基本上意味着轮廓。

54
So maybe before you start to work out, your body is very soft.
所以也许在你开始锻炼之前，你的身体非常柔软。

55
You can't see the muscles.
你看不到肌肉。

56
Well, when you start to see those muscles, you see the lines in your body, your skin gets tighter, not so soft.
当你开始看到那些肌肉时，你会看到身体的线条，皮肤变得紧致，不再那么柔软。

57
That's called muscle tone.
