I'd like to say that without the assistance and support of each and every one of you, we really could not have devised this campaign.
我想说，没有你们每一个人的帮助和支持，我们真的无法制定这个活动。

10
I'd like to take my hat off and really thank you all for the wonderful work you've done so far, not only in helping support our marketing efforts, but also in continuing your commitment to Alpha computers.
我想向你们致敬，感谢你们迄今为止所做的出色工作，不仅支持我们的营销工作，还继续对Alpha电脑的承诺。

我毫不怀疑我们这里有一支优秀的团队，我们可以共同将Alpha电脑推向全新的成功水平。

12
On the subject of the campaign, let me ask you all a question.
关于这个活动，我想问大家一个问题。

13
How do you define the perfect laptop?
你们如何定义完美的笔记本电脑？

14
Is it about affordability, quality, speed, reliability?
是关于价格、质量、速度、可靠性吗？

15
What do you look for in a consumer?
你们在消费者身上寻找什么？

16
Well, I believe the answer lies in a combination of all of these elements.
我相信答案在于这些元素的结合。

17
Our campaign will really hammer home the point that the X420 is a state-of-the-art laptop for all of your computing needs.
我们的活动将强调X420是满足你所有计算需求的尖端笔记本电脑。

18
With our television campaign, we hope to really reach out to a huge audience.
通过我们的电视活动，我们希望真正接触到大量观众。

19
We have a great ad campaign plan focused on the fantastic USPs of the X420.
我们有一个伟大的广告活动计划，专注于X420的独特卖点。

20
We've hired one of the best PR companies to work with us on the campaign and have already completed three separate TV adverts, all focusing on one key feature of the X420.
我们聘请了最好的公关公司之一来协助我们进行活动，并已经完成了三则独立的电视广告，全部聚焦于X420的一个关键特性。

21
I'm excited to say that today, for the first time, we will unveil to all of you here the first of these advertisements.
我很高兴地说，今天我们将首次向大家揭晓这些广告中的第一则。

22
Alright, we're back and now let's take a look at five key words on language takeaway.
好的，我们回来了，现在让我们看看今天挑选的五个关键词。

23
Alright, so first up, Marco, we have a verb.
好的，首先，Marco，我们有一个动词。

24
The verb is to devise.
这个动词是“设计”。

25
That's right, so we devised a campaign.
没错，我们设计了一个活动。

26
Okay, so to devise in this case means to create or to come up with.
好的，在这种情况下，“设计”意味着创造或想出。

27
That's right.
没错。

28
I think in many movies you will hear that someone will devise a plan to destroy the world, for example.
我想在许多电影中你会听到有人设计一个摧毁世界的计划，例如。

29
Right, or to devise a scheme.
对，或者设计一个方案。

30
So that's to create or to come up with a plan or come up with something.
所以这就是创造或想出一个计划或某种东西。

31
And talking about the computers, he mentioned a couple of words that describe it, especially the affordability of the laptop computer.
说到电脑，他提到了一些描述它的词，特别是笔记本电脑的价格。

32
Okay, so yeah, there's this string of nouns that Mr. Ford thinks are very important relating to the perfect laptop.
好的，是的，Ford先生认为与完美笔记本电脑相关的一系列名词非常重要。

33
And in this case, affordability is the first one.
在这种情况下，价格是第一个。

34
So something that is affordable is something that you can have the money to buy.
所以，负担得起的东西是你有钱可以买到的东西。

35
It's not too expensive.
它不是太贵。

36
That's the adjective, affordable.
这是形容词，负担得起。

37
Affordability means whether or not something is expensive.
价格意味着某物是否昂贵。

38
That's right.
没错。

39
So if you think of the adjective affordable, the noun would be affordability.
所以如果你想到形容词“负担得起”，名词就是“价格”。

40
So this is just the way that you can transform an adjective into a noun.
这就是你如何将形容词转化为名词。

41
Right, so this is something that comes up a lot when we're talking about buying things.
对，所以在我们谈论购买东西时，这种情况经常出现。

42
For example, Marco, I could say, what do you look for when you're buying a car?
例如，Marco，我可以说，你在买车时寻找什么？

43
Right, so I can say affordability.
对，所以我可以说价格。

44
And you could also say our next one, which is reliability.
你也可以说我们的下一个词，即可靠性。

45
That's right.
没错。

46
So if you look for a car, you are also looking for reliability.
所以如果你在找车，你也在寻找可靠性。

47
And this comes from the adjective reliable.
这来自形容词“可靠”。

48
All right, so something is reliable if you can depend on it.
好的，如果某物是可靠的，你可以依赖它。

49
It means, you know, in the case of a laptop or a car, it won't break easily.
这意味着，在笔记本电脑或汽车的情况下，它不会轻易坏掉。

50
That's right.
没错。

51
So a person can also be reliable.
所以一个人也可以是可靠的。

52
You can trust that person to help you, for example.
你可以信任那个人来帮助你，例如。

53
Or I could trust that he'll never be late or never forget that we have an appointment.
或者我可以信任他永远不会迟到或忘记我们有约会。

54
That's exactly right.
没错。

55
Well, moving on to the next part of Mr. Ford's speech.
好的，继续Ford先生演讲的下一部分。

56
He talked about the television campaign and how he really hopes to reach out to a huge audience with this television advert.
他谈到了电视活动，以及他真的希望通过这个电视广告接触到大量观众。

57
All right, so the reason we've chosen this is because it's important to remember this as a phrase to reach out to.
好的，我们选择这个是因为记住“接触到”这个短语很重要。

58
That means to connect with.
这意味着与……联系。

59
And I think your example of television is a really great one because television allows people to reach out to many, many, many people.
我认为你提到的电视是一个很好的例子，因为电视可以让人们接触到很多很多人。

60
That's right.
没错。

61
Also, for example, with Internet, you are able to reach out to many people all over the world.
例如，通过互联网，你能够接触到世界各地的许多人。

62
So to reach out to is to connect with.
所以“接触到”就是与……联系。

63
Uh-huh, okay.
嗯，好吧。

64
And for our last word, when he was about to show everyone the TV advert, he said that tonight for the first time we will unveil the first of these advertisements.
对于我们的最后一个词，当他准备向大家展示电视广告时，他说今晚我们将首次揭晓这些广告中的第一则。

65
All right, so to unveil something is actually very exciting because to unveil something is to show it for the very first time.
好的，揭晓某物实际上是非常令人兴奋的，因为揭晓某物就是第一次展示它。

66
That's right.
没错。

67
So maybe you've seen in car shows where they have a car under a big white sheet and on that night they're going to unveil the new model of the, I don't know, the Ford car.
所以也许你在汽车展上看到过，他们在一块大白布下有一辆车，今晚他们将揭晓新款的，我不知道，福特车。

68
So that's what it means to unveil, to take away this veil and show everyone.
所以这就是揭晓的意思，揭开这个面纱并展示给大家。

69
Mm -hmm, to unveil.
嗯，揭晓。

70
All right, so a lot of good key words there.
好的，有很多好的关键词。

71
Why don't we go back and listen to Mr. Ford again and when we return we'll talk about Fluency Builder.
我们为什么不回去再听听Ford先生，然后我们回来谈谈流利度提升。

Fluency Builder So in the beginning, Mr. Ford is talking about this exciting X420 and he says that he would like to say that without the help of each and every one of you the campaign could not have been created.

106
This is something that used to be very polite because when you meet someone or you want to thank someone you take your hat off as a sign of respect.

我们还有四节课，都是关于这个的，它们会变得更复杂，我们将继续讨论，接下来的几节课实际上是在回答公众的问题和许多类似的事情。

165
Yeah, I think they're really useful because sometimes you prepare your presentation, you feel really good about it but those questions at the end can be scary because you don't really know how to answer a question properly in English or you don't know how to anticipate a question that you might get from the crowd.
是的，我认为它们真的很有用，因为有时你准备演示时，感觉很好，但最后的问题可能会让人害怕，因为你不知道如何用英语正确回答问题，或者你不知道如何预见可能会从观众那里得到的问题。
