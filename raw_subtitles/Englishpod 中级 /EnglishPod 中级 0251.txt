40
So the first thing we're talking about today is a basic.
今天我们要谈的第一样东西是基础。

41
Most women carry this around in their purses.
大多数女性都会把这个放在她们的包里。

42
It's called lipstick.
它叫口红。

43
That's right, and as you said, this is a pretty basic thing.
没错，正如你所说，这是一种非常基本的东西。

44
It's the kind of like paint that you put on your lips, and it's called a lipstick because it looks like a little stick.
这就像你涂在嘴唇上的颜料，叫口红是因为它看起来像一根小棒。

45
Right, and you turn it with your fingers, and it comes up, and then you turn it again, and it goes down, basically keeping it from touching all of the things in your purse.
对，你用手指转动它，它就会上升，然后再转动，它就会下降，基本上防止它碰到你包里的所有东西。

46
That's right, so lipstick.
没错，所以是口红。

47
And well, apart from this, we also have nail Polish, and this is also very popular with the ladies.
除此之外，我们还有指甲油，这在女士中也非常受欢迎。

48
When you paint your nails a certain color.
当你给指甲涂上某种颜色时。

49
That's right, so Polish is basically anything that makes something shiny.
没错，所以指甲油基本上是让某物发光的任何东西。

50
It's something that you add to surfaces.
它是你添加到表面的东西。

51
So you could add Polish to wood on a table, but in this case we're putting it on our nails.
所以你可以在桌子的木头上添加指甲油，但在这种情况下，我们把它涂在指甲上。

52
That is fingernails or toenails.
也就是手指甲或脚趾甲。

53
So it's nail Polish.
所以是指甲油。

55
And now we're getting into the specific things.
现在我们进入具体的东西。

56
A lot of makeup that women use on their eyes.
很多女性在眼睛上使用的化妆品。

57
So for example, the first thing she said, she needs to get an eyeliner.
例如，她说的第一样东西，她需要买眼线笔。

58
Okay, so eyeliner is basically a pencil.
好的，眼线笔基本上是一支铅笔。

59
This is what the guy is making fun of her about.
这是那个男的在嘲笑她的地方。

60
He says it's just a pencil or a crayon for your eye.
他说这只是你眼睛的铅笔或蜡笔。

61
And so basically you use it to draw a line on the top or the bottom of your eye, your eyelid.
所以基本上你用它在眼睛的上面或下面画一条线，眼睑上。

62
Okay, so yeah, it kind of looks like a marker, and it comes I think black in different colors, and then you paint little lines around your eyes to make them more pronounced.
好的，所以是的，它看起来有点像记号笔，颜色有黑色和其他不同颜色，然后你在眼睛周围画小线条，让它们更明显。

63
So it's called an eyeliner.
所以叫眼线笔。

64
Okay, and now we have an eyelash curler, and also I think this is very important for the ladies.
好的，现在我们有睫毛夹，我认为这对女士来说也很重要。

65
Yeah, well not everyone uses this.
是的，并不是每个人都使用这个。

66
It's a little bit of a scary instrument.
这是一种有点可怕的工具。

67
It looks like it might pop your eye out.
它看起来可能会把你的眼睛弹出来。

68
It's something you use on your eyelashes.
这是你用在睫毛上的东西。

69
So those are the hairs that come off of your eye, and basically you use this to make them curly or to make them seem a bit longer and prettier.
所以那些是从你眼睛上长出来的毛发，基本上你用这个让它们卷曲或看起来更长更漂亮。

70
So an eyelash curler is something that it's almost like a press or something for your eyelashes.
所以睫毛夹就像是一个压夹，用于你的睫毛。

71
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

72
And well, now that we've got that covered, we move on to eyeshadow, and I think this goes on your eyelid, right?
现在我们已经覆盖了这些，我们继续谈眼影，我认为这涂在眼睑上，对吗？

73
That's right.
没错。

74
Some people make it go further.
有些人会涂得更远。

75
They put it on their face above their eyelid, but that's a little bit crazy.
他们把它涂在眼睑上方的脸上，但那有点疯狂。

76
I think eyeshadow generally goes, like you said, on your eyelid, and it can be in many different colors.
我认为眼影通常涂在眼睑上，可以有很多不同的颜色。

77
So blue, pink, red, whatever.
比如蓝色、粉色、红色等等。

78
People sometimes go crazy with eyeshadow.

Okay, and now what about an eyebrow pencil?

81
Sometimes people like to make their eyebrows look darker or thicker, and so they use this pencil.

82
It's usually brown or black, and they use it on their eyebrows.
通常是棕色或黑色，他们用它在眉毛上。

83
So we've picked up a lot of vocab here related to your eye.
所以我们在这里学到了很多与眼睛相关的词汇。

84
For example, an eyelash, your eyelid.
例如，睫毛、眼睑。

85
Now we're talking about the eyebrows, which are the hairs on top, more or less around your forehead.
现在我们谈论眉毛，它们是大致在额头上方的毛发。

86
And now we also have another type of makeup called mascara.
现在我们还有另一种化妆品叫睫毛膏。

87
This is another basic.
这也是一种基础。

88
So like we said earlier, lipstick is something you almost always find in a woman's purse.
正如我们之前所说，口红几乎总是可以在女性的包里找到。

89
Well, mascara is another one of those things.
而睫毛膏也是其中之一。

90
Almost everybody wears mascara.
几乎每个人都涂睫毛膏。

91
This is kind of like a brush for your eyelashes, and it paints them a different color.
这就像是给睫毛刷的东西，它给睫毛涂上不同的颜色。

92
So most women wear black or brown, and it makes your eyelashes look really long.
所以大多数女性涂黑色或棕色，它让你的睫毛看起来非常长。

93
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

94
So this is kind of like paint for your eyelashes.
所以这就像是给睫毛涂的颜料。

95
And now moving away from your eyelashes, we're gonna have, we're buying also some foundation and liquid foundation.
现在离开睫毛，我们还要买一些粉底和液体粉底。

96
Okay, so foundation is just a kind of base for your face.
好的，粉底就是你脸上的一种基础。

97
So foundation, like a building is the very bottom.
所以粉底，就像建筑物的基础，是最底层。

98
Well, in this case, it's something that you put on your cheeks, on your face, in general, on your forehead to kind of smooth your skin out and make it look all the same color or the same, the same texture.
在这种情况下，它是你涂在脸颊、脸上、额头上的东西，以平滑你的皮肤，使其看起来颜色均匀或质地相同。

99
And so foundation can be like, like we see here, either a powder, which is kind of like a dry substance, or you can use liquid foundation, which is like it says liquid, it's almost like a thick cream.
所以粉底可以是像我们看到的那样，粉状的，像干的物质，或者你可以使用液体粉底，像它所说的液体，几乎像厚奶油。

100
Alright, so foundation is, as you said, I guess you just want to make your skin look the same color, the same texture, because obviously not everyone's skin is perfect.
好吧，所以粉底就是，正如你所说，我想你只是想让你的皮肤看起来颜色均匀，质地相同，因为显然并不是每个人的皮肤都是完美的。

101
We all have some spots maybe or some different color on our face.
我们的脸上可能都有一些斑点或不同的颜色。

102
You say we like you wear foundation too.
你说我们也像你一样涂粉底。

103
Do you wear makeup, Marco?
马尔科，你化妆吗？

104
Well, I mean, we as people, because you know, alright, no, no, no, no, none of this makeup for me, although I have used an eyelash curler once.
嗯，我是说，我们作为人，知道的，好的，不，不，不，我不化妆，虽然我曾经用过一次睫毛夹。

106
Well, my friends dared me to, so okay.
嗯，我的朋友们让我试试，所以好吧。

107
And you loved it.

108
Of course.
当然。

109
Now I use it all the time.
现在我一直在用。

110
No, no.
不，不。

111
But what I do use is now things related to guys.
但我现在用的是与男士相关的东西。

112
So for example, the girlfriend was saying, well, you buy razors and aftershave.
比如说，女朋友说，你买剃须刀和须后水。

113
So what are these things?
那这些东西是什么？

114
Well, razors aren't just a guy thing.
嗯，剃须刀并不仅仅是男士的东西。

115
Everyone can have a razor.

116
It's basically a blade like a very sharp piece of metal that you use to cut hair.
它基本上是一种刀片，像一块非常锋利的金属，用来剃头发。

117
So the hair on your legs, the hair on your face.
所以腿上的毛，脸上的毛。

118
These are these are things that you cut with a razor and men use razors to shave their faces, shave their chins or above their lip.
这些是用剃须刀剃的东西，男人用剃须刀剃脸、剃下巴或上唇。

119
Alright.
好吧。

120
And well, actually, after we shave our beard, we put on a little bit of aftershave, which is basically kind of like alcohol that smells really nice.
实际上，剃完胡子后，我们会涂一点须后水，基本上就像一种闻起来很好的酒精。

121
That's right, because shaving can actually hurt your skin or the hairs under your skin can become really itchy or irritated.
没错，因为剃须实际上可能会伤害你的皮肤，或者皮肤下的毛发可能会变得非常痒或刺激。

122
And so aftershave helps make everything feel better.
所以须后水有助于让一切感觉更好。

123
Okay.
好的。

124
And well, sometimes we also use a little bit of Cologne to smell nice.
有时我们也会用一点香水来闻起来很好。

125
So women usually wear perfume, which is, you know, all the perfumes like CK and Ugo Boss and all that stuff, as well as for guys, it's usually called Cologne.
所以女性通常使用香水，你知道的，所有的香水像CK和乌戈·博斯等等，而男士通常称之为古龙水。

126
Okay, that's right.
好的，没错。

127
It's an important difference there because we don't say perfume for guys, and we don't say Cologne for girls.
这是一个重要的区别，因为我们不对男士说香水，也不对女士说古龙水。

128
So women wear perfume, like you said, but men wear Cologne.
所以女性使用香水，正如你所说，但男性使用古龙水。

129
And this word is very funny looking.
这个词看起来很有趣。

130
It ends with, it's spelled c-o-l-o-g-n-e.
它以c-o-l-o-g-n-e拼写。

131
So you don't It's Cologne.

And it's something that you put on your neck or your face to smell really good if you're a man.
这是你涂在脖子或脸上的东西，让你闻起来很好，如果你是男士。

133
Exactly.
正是。

134
And finally, if you have long hair or maybe you have very spiky hair like I do, you need to wear a little bit of gel to kind of give your head a little bit of shape.
最后，如果你有长发，或者像我一样有非常尖的头发，你需要涂一点发胶来给你的头发一些形状。

135
That's right.
没错。

136
So gel is actually the name of a kind of substance.
所以发胶实际上是一种物质的名称。

137
It's not liquid, but it's not hard either.
它不是液体，但也不是硬的。

138
And it's basically thick like paste that you put in your hair to keep it in one place.

183
So a bite can be a noun, like a thing, like a piece of food that you eat, but it can also be a verb to bite like, you know, the dog bites the man.
所以一口可以是名词，像是你吃的食物的一部分，但它也可以是动词，像是，狗咬人。
