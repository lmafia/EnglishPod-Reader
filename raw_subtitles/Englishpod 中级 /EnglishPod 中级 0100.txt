39
Maybe, but what he does speak is English, and since this is EnglishPod, why don't we look at some of the phrases that they used for Smalltalk and Fluency Builder.
也许，但他会说英语，既然这是EnglishPod，为什么我们不看看他们在小谈话和流利表达中使用的一些短语呢？

40
Alright, so today on Fluency Builder, we're gonna take a look at phrases that both the passenger and the taxi driver use to make Smalltalk.
好的，今天在流利表达中，我们将看看乘客和出租车司机用来进行小谈话的短语。

44
If you don't mind me saying so.

If you don't mind me saying so, I just don't think this is a good idea.

So you can use this phrase in the beginning or at the end of a sentence.

60
Now again, he also apologizes a little bit when he says, excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but... Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy but... Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy but... Okay, so let's take a look at this.

231
Right, you can say, well, how long have you been married?

233
But if a guy asks a girl, oh, are you married?
