90
We call these people the less fortunate.

92
So as you said, we've got three words here that mean poor people, basically.
所以正如你所说，我们这里有三个词，基本上是指穷人。

93
And we don't like to say poor people in English because it's not very nice.
我们不喜欢在英语中说穷人，因为这不是很友好。

94
You know, people can't control their situation in many cases.
你知道，人们在很多情况下无法控制自己的处境。

95
It's more of a situation of not having what others have.

97
So a person that's less fortunate is a person that's poor.

100
Okay.

101
So fortunate is a way of saying that you have fortune or you have luck.

这来自于需要。

111

123
Homeless literally means without a home.
无家可归字面意思是没有家。

124
And so we often talk about the homeless as being a group of people we want to help in society because the homeless live on the streets.
所以我们常常谈论无家可归者，作为我们想要帮助的一个群体，因为无家可归者生活在街头。

125
They live in public and in the winter and times when it's really, really cold it's very dangerous for them.
他们生活在公共场所，在冬天和非常寒冷的时候对他们来说非常危险。

Our first phrase comes from the beginning of the dialogue with Mark, who says, you know, there are some people who are struggling to make ends meet.

If you want to make a circle out of that string, you have to connect the ends.

180

But I say I've been able to make ends meet for a while now because I have a pretty good job.

但基本上这个想法是你志愿服务或捐钱来帮助他人。

201

That's right.
没错。

204

208

What does it mean if you fall on hard times?

212
So not being able to make ends meet, not being able to pay for your food and your housing.
所以无法维持生计，无法支付食物和住房。

213
And so we have the verb to fall.
所以我们有动词“经历”。

214
You've fallen on hard times because you've gone from a place where you're comfortable to a lower place, a place where life is really hard.
你经历了艰难时期，因为你从一个舒适的地方降到一个生活非常艰难的地方。

217
He fell on hard times or they fell on hard times.

218
This means they don't have much money or they can't support themselves or they went bankrupt, for example.
