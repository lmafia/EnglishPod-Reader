Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.
大家好，欢迎来到EnglishPod。

2
My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

3
My name is Catherine, and today we have a very painful lesson for you.
我叫Catherine，今天我们有一节非常痛苦的课程给你们。

4
That's right.
没错。

5
Today we're going to go to one of the worst places for me.
今天我们要去我最不喜欢的地方之一。

6
We're going to go to the dentist.
我们要去看牙医。

7
Okay, so the person in this dialogue has a pain in their mouth, in the tooth area, so let's take a listen to this dialogue, and when we come back, we'll be talking a little bit more about it.
好的，这个对话中的人嘴里有痛，牙齿区域有问题，所以让我们听一下这个对话，回来后我们会再谈谈。

8
What seems to be the problem?
你有什么问题？

9
I have a really bad toothache.
我有很严重的牙痛。

10
My cheek is swollen, and I can't eat anything.
我的脸颊肿了，我什么都吃不下。

11
Let's have a look.
让我们看看。

12
Mmm, this doesn't look too good.
嗯，这看起来不太好。

13
I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth.
我想我们可能需要拔掉你的智齿。

14
It's pressing against your molars, and that's one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain.
它压迫着你的磨牙，这就是你感到如此疼痛的原因之一。

15
When you pull my tooth, will you also have to extract the nerve and the root?
拔我的牙时，你还需要拔掉神经和根吗？

16
First we will take some x-rays and see what we're dealing with.
首先我们会拍一些X光片，看看我们要处理什么。

17
I also noticed a small cavity up front here, so you are going to need a filling.
我还注意到前面有一个小蛀牙，所以你需要补牙。

18
I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day.
我想这就是我不每天三次使用牙线或刷牙的结果。

19
It could be that, or maybe you are eating too many sweets.
可能是这样，或者你吃了太多糖果。

20
In any case, I'll administer an anesthetic and you won't feel a thing.
无论如何，我会给你麻醉剂，你不会感觉到任何东西。

21
Alright, we're back, and obviously we're going to take a look at a lot of vocab related to going to the dentist and experiencing a little bit of pain.
好的，我们回来了，显然我们将要看很多与看牙医和经历一些疼痛相关的词汇。

22
So let's take a look at that in Language Takeaway.
所以让我们在语言收获中看看这些。

23
Ok, first up in Language Takeaway today, we have the root of the problem.
好的，今天语言收获的第一项是问题的根源。

24
It's a toothache.
这是牙痛。

25
That's right, we have a really bad toothache.
没错，我们有很严重的牙痛。

26
Ok, well ache means pain or soreness, and tooth is your tooth.
好的，疼痛意味着痛或酸，而牙齿就是你的牙齿。

27
So, I could say, oh gosh, I have a really bad toothache.
所以，我可以说，哦天哪，我有很严重的牙痛。

28
That's right, that means your tooth, or your teeth, hurt.
没错，这意味着你的牙齿，或者你的牙齿，疼。

29
And basically you can combine it like a stomach ache, or headache.
基本上你可以像胃痛或头痛那样组合。

30
Backache.
背痛。

31
Backache.
背痛。

32
That's right, so usually when you have a toothache, you experience different symptoms, different things happen to you.
没错，所以通常当你有牙痛时，你会经历不同的症状，发生不同的事情。

33
What's one of these things, Marco?
这些事情之一是什么，Marco？

34
Well, in this case, the girl had a swollen cheek.
嗯，在这种情况下，女孩的脸颊肿了。

35
Her cheek is swollen.
她的脸颊肿了。

36
Ouch, so the cheek is the side of the face, it's usually where it's a little bit pink, and when your cheek is swollen, it looks puffy, it looks bigger than normal.
哎呀，所以脸颊是脸的侧面，通常是有点粉红色的，当你的脸颊肿了时，它看起来鼓鼓的，比正常大。

37
That's right, so for example, sometimes you fall and you hurt your finger, and it'll get fat, and it'll get puffy, as you say, it's swollen.
没错，比如说，有时你摔倒了，伤到手指，它会变得肿，正如你所说，它肿了。

38
That's right, so anything can be swollen really.
没错，任何东西都可能肿。

39
When you hit your toe on something hard, and your toe later gets bigger, it's swollen.
当你把脚趾撞到硬物上，脚趾后来变大了，那就是肿。

40
That's right, so obviously her cheek is swollen, and she has a toothache, because apparently her wisdom teeth, or her wisdom tooth, is coming out.
没错，所以显然她的脸颊肿了，她有牙痛，因为显然她的智齿，或者她的智齿，正在长出来。

41
Alright, so wisdom teeth are special teeth.
好的，所以智齿是特殊的牙齿。

42
I don't know if they actually have anything to do with wisdom, which means being smart.
我不知道它们是否真的与智慧有关，智慧意味着聪明。

43
To be wise.
明智。

44
Wise, but wisdom teeth are those four teeth in the very, very, very back of your mouth.
明智，但智齿是你嘴巴最里面的四颗牙齿。

45
That's right, so these are the last teeth that come in, or the last teeth that grow in your mouth, so I think usually you're 18 or 20 when they come in.
没错，所以这些是最后长出来的牙齿，或者是你嘴里最后长出来的牙齿，所以我想通常你18或20岁时它们才会长出来。

46
That's right, a lot of people experience these when they're older, maybe that's why they call them wisdom teeth, because you're older and you're wiser.
没错，很多人在年纪大时经历这些，也许这就是为什么他们称之为智齿，因为你年纪大了，变得更聪明。

47
I had them when I was about 14, 13, so I was very young, but these come in in the very back.
我大约14、13岁时有过，所以我很年轻，但这些是在最里面长出来的。

48
They're the furthest away from your lips.
它们离你的嘴唇最远。

49
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

50
So when they come in, sometimes there's not enough space, and so they start to press against the other teeth in your mouth, specifically against your molars.
所以当它们长出来时，有时空间不够，所以它们开始压迫你嘴里的其他牙齿，特别是磨牙。

51
So molars are other teeth, these are also in the back of your mouth.
所以磨牙是其他牙齿，这些也在你嘴的后面。

52
You can tell which ones are molars, I believe, because they're flat on top, they look like a little square.
我相信你可以分辨出哪些是磨牙，因为它们的顶部是平的，看起来像一个小方块。

53
Those are the ones that you use to chew your food with, mostly.
那些是你主要用来咀嚼食物的牙齿。

54
Exactly, they're not pointy like your front teeth, and so molars are in the back of your mouth, wisdom teeth are in the very back of your mouth, and molars can be very sore when the wisdom teeth push against them, and so in this case you'll have to take your teeth out, or the dentist will take your teeth out, but what's something we say when we talk about taking the whole tooth out?
没错，它们不像前面的牙齿那样尖，所以磨牙在你嘴的后面，智齿在你嘴的最里面，当智齿压迫它们时，磨牙可能会非常疼，所以在这种情况下你需要拔掉牙齿，或者牙医会拔掉你的牙齿，但我们谈到拔掉整颗牙时，我们说什么？

55
Well, in this case, he's going to extract the tooth, but also he's going to extract the nerve and the root.
嗯，在这种情况下，他会拔掉牙齿，但他也会拔掉神经和根。

56
Okay, so nerves are parts of our bodies, we can't see them, but they help us feel things.
好的，所以神经是我们身体的一部分，我们看不见它们，但它们帮助我们感知事物。

57
So maybe when someone hits me, the nerves in my arm, they tell my brain that it hurts.
所以也许当有人打我时，我手臂里的神经会告诉我的大脑疼。

58
Well, we also have nerves in our teeth, and that's what we're talking about here, but what's this other thing?
嗯，我们的牙齿里也有神经，这就是我们在谈论的内容，但还有什么其他的东西？

59
You talked about the nerve and... And the root.
你提到了神经和……根。

60
It's very similar to a plant, for example.
这与植物非常相似。

61
Consider that your teeth are like plants, and they have little roots that go into your gums, and this is how basically you get teeth stay alive.
想象一下你的牙齿就像植物，它们有小根深入你的牙龈，这就是你牙齿保持活力的方式。

62
They are fed, basically, by your body.
它们基本上是由你的身体供养的。

63
Alright, so root, like with a tree or a plant, is the very bottom of something, and in this case, to extract means to take out, or to take away.
好的，所以根，就像树或植物，是某物的最底部，在这种情况下，拔掉意味着取出或移走。

64
So the dentist will have to extract the root and the nerve.
所以牙医必须拔掉根和神经。

65
So that sounds pretty painful.
听起来很痛。

66
It's painful, but they have to do it, right?
这很痛，但他们必须这样做，对吗？

67
So when the dentist has to extract the tooth, in this case, the nerve and the root and everything, in order for you not to feel it, he gives you special drugs.
所以当牙医必须拔掉牙齿，在这种情况下，神经和根以及一切，为了让你不感觉到，他会给你特殊的药物。

68
What are these drugs called?
这些药物叫什么？

69
These are called anesthetics.
这些叫麻醉剂。

70
Okay, so most people, when they are having major surgery, they get anesthetics so that they can't feel anything.
好的，所以大多数人，在进行重大手术时，他们会得到麻醉剂，这样他们就感觉不到任何东西。

71
Remember, we were just talking about nerves.
记住，我们刚刚在谈论神经。

72
Well, anesthetics make it so that you can't feel things through your nerves.
嗯，麻醉剂使你无法通过神经感知事物。

73
That's right.
没错。

74
So obviously, you don't want to feel the pain when somebody's pulling that tooth out of your mouth, so you get an anesthetic, and then you don't really feel anything.
所以显然，当有人把牙齿拔出你的嘴时，你不想感到疼痛，所以你会得到麻醉剂，然后你真的感觉不到任何东西。

75
You kind of feel something, but you don't really feel pain.
你会感觉到一些东西，但你并不真的感到疼痛。

76
Exactly.
没错。

77
So anesthetic basically makes you numb.
所以麻醉剂基本上让你麻木。

78
Numb, that's right.
麻木，没错。

79
That's the word, numb.
这个词，麻木。

80
Okay, so we've taken a look at a lot of vocab.
好的，所以我们看了很多词汇。

81
Molars, wisdom teeth, etc.
磨牙，智齿等等。

82
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.
我们再听一次对话，然后我们会在一会儿后回来进行流利度提升。

83
What seems to be the problem?
你有什么问题？

84
I have a really bad toothache.
我有很严重的牙痛。

85
My cheek is swollen, and I can't eat anything.
我的脸颊肿了，我什么都吃不下。

86
Let's have a look.
让我们看看。

87
Mmm, this doesn't look too good.
嗯，这看起来不太好。

88
I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth.
我想我们可能需要拔掉你的智齿。

89
It's pressing against your molars, and that's one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain.
它压迫着你的磨牙，这就是你感到如此疼痛的原因之一。

90
When you pull my tooth, will you also have to extract the nerve and the root?
拔我的牙时，你还需要拔掉神经和根吗？

91
First we will take some x-rays and see what we're dealing with.
首先我们会拍一些X光片，看看我们要处理什么。

92
I also noticed a small cavity up front here, so you are going to need a filling.
我还注意到前面有一个小蛀牙，所以你需要补牙。

93
I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day.

94
It could be that, or maybe you are eating too many sweets.
可能是这样，或者你吃了太多糖果。

95
In any case, I'll administer an anesthetic and you won't feel a thing.
无论如何，我会给你麻醉剂，你不会感觉到任何东西。

96
All right, so the topic of today's lesson is toothache, but it's also basically about learning that you will have to have your tooth taken out.
好的，所以今天课程的主题是牙痛，但基本上也是关于学习你需要拔掉牙齿。

97
So to say this, we say to pull out a tooth.
所以我们说拔掉一颗牙。

98
Okay, so that's what the dentist said.
好的，这就是牙医所说的。

99
I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth.
我想我们可能需要拔掉你的智齿。

100
Not good news.

101
Okay, so to pull out means to extract.

102
So just remember here, this is a phrase that has pull out.
所以记住，这个短语包含 pull out。

103
Out would be the preposition here.
Out 是这里的介词。

104
We wouldn't say pull off or pull out.
我们不会说 pull off 或 pull out。

105
We'd say pull out.
我们会说 pull out。

106
Like for example, you can pull out a hair or your hair.
比如，你可以拔掉一根头发或你的头发。

107
Exactly.
正是如此。

108
Okay, so we're pulling out the wisdom tooth and the dentist first wants to take some x-rays to see what we're dealing with.
好的，所以我们要拔掉智齿，牙医首先想拍一些 X 光片来看看我们要处理什么。

109
Okay, so to deal with something means to work on it or to have something to do with.
好的，处理某事意味着对其进行处理或与之相关。

110
And so in this case, the dentist wants to know, is this serious?
所以在这种情况下，牙医想知道，这是否严重？

111
What are we dealing with here?
我们在处理什么？

112
That's right.
没错。

113
So he's trying to judge the situation.

114
So maybe what would be another scenario or another situation where you would say, I have to see what we're dealing with.
那么还有什么其他场景或情况你会说，我得看看我们在处理什么。

115
Well, in the case of the weather and the newsmen who report about the weather, maybe they see that a storm is coming but they have to look at the radars and the computer screens to see what they're dealing with.
嗯，在天气和报道天气的新闻工作者的情况下，也许他们看到暴风雨即将来临，但他们必须查看雷达和电脑屏幕来看看他们在处理什么。

117
They have to evaluate.

That's right.
没错。

119

好的，非常好。

120
And so we're gonna see what we're dealing with.
所以我们要看看我们在处理什么。

121
And then the girl, I think, knows that she hasn't really taken good care of her teeth and so she says, I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth.
然后那个女孩，我想，她知道自己没有好好照顾牙齿，所以她说，我想这就是我不使用牙线或刷牙的结果。

122
So that's what you get or that's what I get.
所以这就是你得到的，或者这就是我得到的。

123
Here the pronoun changes.
这里代词发生了变化。

124
I, you, he.

133
That's the consequence for your actions.
这是你行为的后果。

134
Exactly.
正是如此。

135

136
And what about our last phrase?
那我们的最后一句话呢？

137
Well this is something that I hate to hear from doctors and dentists because usually it's a lie.
嗯，这是我讨厌听到医生和牙医说的，因为通常这是谎言。

138
A dentist will say before he gives you a shot or before he takes your tooth out, you won't feel a thing.
牙医会在给你打针或拔掉你的牙齿之前说，你不会感觉到任何东西。

139
That's right.
没错。

140
So he's basically saying you're not going to feel any pain.
所以他基本上是在说你不会感到任何疼痛。

141
But why do we say you won't feel a thing instead of you won't feel anything?
但我们为什么说你不会感觉到任何东西而不是你不会感觉到任何东西？

142
It's just a sad phrase.
这只是一个悲伤的短语。

143
It's something we say, I would remember it like this because it's more likely to be said in this way, you won't feel a thing.
这是我们说的，我会记住这个，因为更可能以这种方式说，你不会感觉到任何东西。

144
I think it basically means not even one little thing.
我认为这基本上意味着连一点点都不会。

145
You're not going to feel that.
你不会感觉到那个。

So for example, I'm about to fix someone's back, you know, when you have to pull them and make their back feel better.
所以例如，我正要给某人的背部做调整，你知道，当你需要拉他们并让他们的背部感觉更好时。

147
I say you won't feel a thing.
我说你不会感觉到任何东西。

148
You fix their back.
你调整他们的背部。

149
Okay.
好的。

150
So you won't feel a thing or you won't feel anything.
所以你不会感觉到任何东西，或者你不会感觉到任何东西。

151
Both are correct but I think it's more common to hear you won't feel a thing.
两者都是正确的，但我认为更常听到的是你不会感觉到任何东西。

152
Okay.
好的。

153
So why don't we go back.
