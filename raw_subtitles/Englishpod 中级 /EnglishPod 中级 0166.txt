59
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

60
Okay, well this first one might be the reason for surgery, not necessarily a kind of surgery, if someone is vain.
好吧，这第一个可能是手术的原因，而不一定是一种手术，如果某人是自恋的。

61
Okay, so if a person is vain, this is an adjective.
好吧，如果一个人是自恋的，这是一个形容词。

62
That means that they are very... they care too much about their appearance, right?
这意味着他们非常……太在乎自己的外貌，对吧？

So, do I look good?
那么，我看起来好吗？

65
I love my face, my eyes.
我爱我的脸，我的眼睛。

66
I look so good.
我看起来太好了。

67
So, a person who is vain thinks very highly of themselves.
所以，一个自恋的人对自己评价很高。

68
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

69
And, well, this person, I think, wanted to get surgery as well because she said she had wrinkles.
而且，我认为这个人也想做手术，因为她说她有皱纹。

70
Okay, wrinkles are little lines on your face, so maybe on your forehead or next to your mouth.
好吧，皱纹是你脸上的小线条，可能在你的额头或嘴旁。

71
And generally, when we get older, people get more and more of these.
通常，当我们变老时，人们会越来越多。

72
Right, so you would say you have... even you have wrinkly skin when you're in the bathtub for too long and you look in your hands, they look like raisins, you have wrinkly skin.
对，所以你会说你有……即使你在浴缸里待太久，看看你的手，它们看起来像葡萄干，你有皱纹的皮肤。

73
That's right, wrinkles are little lines in your skin.
没错，皱纹是你皮肤上的小线条。

74
All right, and, well, you have wrinkles, as you said, around your mouth and eyes, and sometimes under your eyes you also have some sagging skin.
好吧，正如你所说，你在嘴和眼睛周围有皱纹，有时在你眼睛下方你也有一些松弛的皮肤。

75
Or under your chin.
或者在你的下巴下。

76
Under your chin as well, yeah.
在你的下巴下也是，没错。

77
That's right, so sagging means coming down, means it's heavy.
没错，所以松弛意味着下垂，意味着它很重。

78
It's like hanging, right?
就像悬挂，对吧？

79
Yeah, so sagging, something sags.
是的，所以松弛，某物下垂。

80
It's heavy, it pulls down, but if you have sagging skin, that means your skin is no longer tight.
它很重，向下拉，但如果你有松弛的皮肤，那意味着你的皮肤不再紧致。

81
It's kind of loose and it hangs.
它有点松弛，悬挂着。

82
Falling off your face.
从你的脸上掉下来。

83
Okay, and, well, a new popular treatment that is not really surgery is this Botox.
好吧，还有一种新的流行治疗，实际上不是手术，就是肉毒杆菌。

84
That's right, so Botox is something that women and some men do every couple of months, I think, and they have to get shots.
没错，所以肉毒杆菌是一些女性和一些男性每隔几个月做一次，我认为，他们必须打针。

85
Right, they're like injections.
对，它们就像注射。

86
That's in your face, so your forehead, or your eyes, and it makes you look younger for a couple of months.
在你的脸上，所以你的额头或眼睛，它让你看起来年轻几个月。

87
I've heard that they also put them in their lips to make them, like, Fuller, right?
我听说他们还把它们注射到嘴唇里，让它们看起来更丰满，对吧？

88
That's right, and sometimes you can say that someone's had too much Botox because they can no longer smile, or they can't stop smiling.
没错，有时你可以说某人打了太多肉毒杆菌，因为他们再也无法微笑，或者他们无法停止微笑。

89
Exactly, and, well, very related to this is also when people get a facelift.
确切地说，而且，与此非常相关的是，当人们做拉皮手术时。

90
Okay, a facelift, so that means that a doctor, a plastic surgeon, will tighten the skin on your face, so he'll pull your eyes and the skin next to your ears to make your face look younger.
好吧，拉皮手术，这意味着医生，整形外科医生，会收紧你脸上的皮肤，所以他会拉你的眼睛和耳朵旁边的皮肤，让你的脸看起来更年轻。

91
Right, so that's called a facelift, so it's to kind of take away those wrinkles, right, or the sagging skin.
对，所以这叫做拉皮手术，目的是去掉那些皱纹，对吧，或松弛的皮肤。

92
Right, lift means to pull up.
对，提升意味着向上拉。

93
It's the opposite of sag.
这是下垂的反义词。

94
Very good.
非常好。

95
All right, so this dialogue has a lot of rich vocabulary related to surgery, so why don't we listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back with a second part of language takeaway to explain a little bit more.

So what other surgical procedure is in store for us?

124
Well, now the big ones.
嗯，现在是大手术。

125
So we've left the face, and we're talking about the rest of the body.
所以我们已经离开了脸部，开始谈论身体的其他部分。

126
All right.
好的。

127
The first one is a tummy tuck.
第一个是腹部整形。

128
Okay, so a tummy tuck.
好吧，腹部整形。

129
What is that exactly?
那到底是什么？

130
Well, let's look at these two words by themselves, because maybe tummy, people have heard before, this is another way to say stomach.
嗯，让我们单独看这两个词，因为也许“腹部”，人们以前听过，这是另一种说法，指的是“胃”。

131
Usually children say tummy.
通常孩子们会说“肚子”。

132
Right, my tummy hurts.
对，我的肚子疼。

133
My tummy hurts, and doctors, they'll say stomach.
我的肚子疼，医生会说“胃”。

134
But the name of this surgery is tummy tuck, because tuck means to put in or to fold.
但这项手术的名称是腹部整形，因为“tuck”意味着放入或折叠。

135
And so my mom used to say, tuck in your shirt.
所以我妈妈以前会说，把你的衬衫塞好。

136
You know when your shirt comes out of your hands, and that means you put it back in?
你知道当你的衬衫从手中出来时，这意味着你把它放回去？

137
Well, a tuck means to fold your stomach under.
嗯，tuck意味着把你的肚子折叠起来。

138
It means to make your stomach look smaller, and they put staples, or I think they sew you up.
这意味着让你的肚子看起来更小，他们会用钉书钉，或者我想他们会缝合你。

139
Yeah, they sew you up.
是的，他们会缝合你。

140
It's pretty painful, right?
这很痛，对吧？

141
I've heard that.
我听说过。

142
Usually this is because somebody got a liposuction, for example, and that's our next word, liposuction.
通常这是因为有人做了抽脂手术，例如，这就是我们的下一个词，抽脂。

143
Okay, lipo, that's kind of fat, right?
好吧，抽脂，那个是脂肪，对吧？

144
Yeah.
是的。

145
And suction means to pull like a vacuum.
而“suction”意味着像真空一样吸。

146
Right, so that's basically what they do.
对，所以这基本上就是他们所做的。

147
They open the person up and kind of use a sort of vacuum type device and suck all the fat out of the stomach or the balcony areas, you know, the love handles that are also called.
他们打开病人的身体，使用一种真空装置，把肚子或侧面区域的脂肪吸出来，你知道，就是所谓的“爱把手”。

148
And this way, they remove all this excess fat.
通过这种方式，他们去除所有多余的脂肪。

149
And because they do this, sometimes the skin, since it's been stretched out because you were a little bit fat, they need to have a tummy tuck.
由于他们这样做，有时皮肤会因为你有点胖而被拉伸，他们需要做腹部整形。

150
That means to hide the extra skin.
这意味着隐藏多余的皮肤。

151
The extra skin to kind of hide it.
多余的皮肤要隐藏起来。

152
So these two words, these two procedures actually go hand in hand, because maybe if you're very fat, you get a liposuction, but that doesn't solve your problem, because now you have all this sagging skin off your stomach.
所以这两个词，这两个程序实际上是相辅相成的，因为如果你非常胖，你做了抽脂，但这并不能解决你的问题，因为现在你有了松弛的肚子皮肤。

153
That's right.
没错。

154
So you have to have a tummy tuck as well.
所以你也必须做腹部整形。

155
All right, so yeah, very, very dangerous procedure I've heard as well, right?
好吧，所以我听说这是一个非常非常危险的手术，对吧？

156
Yeah, and they usually only do it with people who are very, very fat.
是的，他们通常只对非常非常胖的人进行。

157
That means dangerously fat, because if you do it on a skinny person, you could really hurt them.
这意味着危险的肥胖，因为如果你对一个瘦的人这样做，你可能会真的伤害他们。

158
Yeah, of course, fat is also necessary for our bodies.
是的，当然，脂肪对我们的身体也是必要的。

159
All right, so now moving back up to the face again, a very common procedure, I think one of the most common ones is a nose job.
好吧，现在再回到脸上，一个非常常见的手术，我认为最常见的之一是鼻子手术。

160
A nose job.
鼻子手术。

161
And so nose job is very colloquial.
所以鼻子手术是非常口语化的。

162
You'll hear this on the TV.
你会在电视上听到这个。

163
Nose job means to fix someone's nose, to change the shape or appearance of their nose.
鼻子手术意味着修复某人的鼻子，改变他们鼻子的形状或外观。

164
And so oftentimes people with really big noses want smaller noses.
所以通常有非常大鼻子的人想要更小的鼻子。

165
And so the doctor will take some bone away and will put the skin back.
所以医生会去掉一些骨头，然后把皮肤放回去。

166
Yes, and that's right.
是的，没错。

167
So this is called a nose job, or formerly known as like a nose surgery, right?
所以这叫做鼻子手术，或者以前称为鼻子手术，对吧？

168
That's right, rhinoplasty is the official name.
没错，正式名称是鼻整形。

169
And actually I've heard it's very painful because they have to break your nose before they fix it.
其实我听说这很痛，因为他们必须先打断你的鼻子，然后再修复它。

170
Exactly, wow.
确实，哇。

171
I can't believe people do this.
我无法相信人们会这样做。

172
All right, and well, one of the very common ones among women, most likely, is... I hope so.
好吧，女性中非常常见的手术，最有可能的是... 我希望如此。

173
...our breast implants.
...我们的隆胸手术。

174
That's right, so breast implants.
没错，所以隆胸手术。

175
Am I allowed to say boob job?
我可以说“胸部手术”吗？

176
Yeah, you can.
是的，你可以。

177
Well, the very common phrase for this is boob job.
嗯，这个非常常见的说法是“胸部手术”。

178
Boob is a very colloquial term for breasts.
“胸部”是一个非常口语化的术语，指的是乳房。

179
And breast implants are... well, an implant is something that you put inside something.
而隆胸手术是... 嗯，植入物是你放入某物内部的东西。

180
Okay, and so a breast implant is a piece of silicone.
好吧，所以隆胸手术是一个硅胶的片。

181
So it's like plastic, but it's more like a liquid plastic.
所以它像塑料，但更像液体塑料。

182
Yeah, just imagine like this big plastic bag with like gel right inside of it.
是的，想象一下这个大塑料袋，里面装着凝胶。

183
And they put that inside a woman's chest to make her breasts bigger.
他们把它放进女人的胸部，让她的乳房变大。

184
Right.
对。

185
And so these are very, very popular surgeries, breast implants.
所以这些是非常非常受欢迎的手术，隆胸手术。

186
Right, exactly.
对，没错。

187
I guess many models and many, many types, different types of women get breast implants.
我想很多模特和许多不同类型的女性都会做隆胸手术。

188
That's right, and the verb there is to get.
没错，动词是“做”。

189
So she had, she got breast implants.
所以她做了隆胸手术。

190
Right.
对。

191
Okay, because they're things.
