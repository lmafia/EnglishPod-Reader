31
The first phobia that we have is called aerophobia.

32
That's right, aerophobia.
没错，飞行恐惧症。

33
And that means that you are scared of flying.
这意味着你害怕飞行。

34
Okay, so we can tell because phobia means fear of something but it's not just a fear.

35
It means that if you go on an airplane you get very very upset.
这意味着如果你坐飞机，你会非常非常不安。

36
You think that you're going to die.
你会觉得自己要死了。

37
That's right.

38
Okay, and so phobia is a very serious fear.
所以恐惧症是一种非常严重的恐惧。

39
But aero, like aeroplane, is the prefix.
但“aero”，像飞机，是前缀。

40
So aerophobia is a fear of going on airplanes.
所以飞行恐惧症是对坐飞机的恐惧。

41
That's right.
没错。

42
And another phobia that we have is arachnophobia.
还有另一种恐惧症是蜘蛛恐惧症。

43
So again, as you see in the prefix, arachno is related to a spider.
所以如你所见，前缀“arachno”与蜘蛛有关。

44
That's right.
没错。

45
So this comes from the origins of English.
这源于英语的起源。

46
I'm not sure if it's Greek or Latin but arachnophobia, like arachnid, has to do with spiders.
我不确定是希腊语还是拉丁语，但蜘蛛恐惧症，像节肢动物，和蜘蛛有关。

47
So I'm afraid of spiders if I have arachnophobia.
所以如果我有蜘蛛恐惧症，我就害怕蜘蛛。

48
That is right.
没错。

49
And now taking a look at two more types of phobias here.
现在我们来看另外两种恐惧症。

50
We have acrophobia and glossophobia.
我们有高空恐惧症和公众演讲恐惧症。

51
So let's take a look at the first one, acrophobia.
让我们先看看高空恐惧症。

52
So acrophobia, acro has to do with heights.
高空恐惧症，acro与高度有关。

53
So I don't like to be on tall buildings.

54
I don't like to maybe look down from heights.

That's right.
没错。

57
You're afraid of being at a very high altitude.
你害怕在很高的地方。

58
Acrophobia.
高空恐惧症。

59
Now, glossophobia is an interesting one because this one, you are scared of public speaking.
现在，公众演讲恐惧症是一个有趣的恐惧，因为你害怕公众演讲。

60
Or you get very nervous when you're in front of a group of people.
或者在一群人面前时你会非常紧张。

61
Right.
对。

62
So this is actually a very, very common fear.
所以这实际上是一种非常非常常见的恐惧。

63
But if it's a serious fear, it's a phobia.
但如果它是一种严重的恐惧，那就是恐惧症。

64
So glossophobia means that when you go in front of people, you get very, very anxious, upset, your stomach hurts, you have wet hands.
所以公众演讲恐惧症意味着当你在众人面前时，你会非常非常焦虑，不安，肚子痛，手心出汗。

65
So that's a very serious fear.
所以这是一种非常严重的恐惧。

66
That's right.
没错。

67
And for our last phobia, we have claustrophobia.
对于我们的最后一种恐惧症，我们有幽闭恐惧症。

68
I think it's one of the most common ones.
我认为这是最常见的之一。

69
If you have claustrophobia, you're afraid of smaller, tight spaces.
如果你有幽闭恐惧症，你害怕狭小的空间。

70
That's right.
没错。

71
So people who... so you heard the word claustrophobic.
所以那些...你听到过幽闭恐惧症这个词。

72
People who are claustrophobic or people who suffer from claustrophobia don't like to be in small, tight places like elevators, for example.
患有幽闭恐惧症的人或患有幽闭恐惧症的人不喜欢待在小而狭窄的地方，比如电梯。

73

74
So now you brought up an interesting point.
所以你提到了一个有趣的观点。

75
Our last phobia, we said claustrophobic.
我们最后提到的恐惧症是幽闭恐惧症。

76
And now we must make the difference between, for example, claustrophobia and being claustrophobic.
现在我们必须区分，例如，幽闭恐惧症和幽闭恐惧症的区别。

77
So a phobia, you hear the word I... you hear the ending IA, claustrophobia, is a noun.
所以恐惧症，你听到的词是...你听到的结尾IA，幽闭恐惧症，是名词。

78
Okay, that means I can talk about I have it, I have this fear.
好的，这意味着我可以说我有这种恐惧。

79
But when you're talking about the adjective, something that describes you, you would have to use the IK ending.
但当你谈论形容词，描述你的东西时，你必须使用IK结尾。

80
I'm claustrophobic.
我有幽闭恐惧症。

81
He is acrophobic.
他有高空恐惧症。

82
They are aerophobic.
他们有飞行恐惧症。

83
Okay, so that is the adjective form.
好的，这就是形容词形式。

84
So if I say, I have arachnophobia, it means I have this fear, or I can say, I am arachnophobic.
所以如果我说，我有蜘蛛恐惧症，这意味着我有这种恐惧，或者我可以说，我是蜘蛛恐惧症患者。

85
Great, so this can be used for all other kinds of phobias.
很好，所以这可以用于所有其他类型的恐惧症。

86
So when you learn those words, remember that there's two different kinds.
所以当你学习这些词时，记住有两种不同的类型。

87
There's the IA, there's the IA phobia, which is the noun, and IK, which is the adjective.
有IA，IA恐惧症是名词，IK是形容词。

88
