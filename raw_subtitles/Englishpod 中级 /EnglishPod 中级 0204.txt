You always add your honor before it or something?

52
That's right.

68
This group is called the jury.

So the jury is a group of normal citizens who will listen to both sides of the story and will then decide if the person committed the crime or didn't commit the crime.
所以陪审团是一组普通公民，他们将听取双方的故事，然后决定这个人是否犯了罪。

71
That's right.
没错。

72
A jury.
陪审团。

73
And the big question is, who's fighting?
那么大问题是，谁在争斗？

74
We have two sides.

75
Someone who is upset and someone who is defending themselves.
一方感到不满，另一方为自己辩护。

76
The person who is upset, this is the prosecution.

79
That's right.

80
And they're trying to prove that that person committed the crime.

81
For example, I say that Marco burned down my house.
例如，我说Marco烧了我的房子。

82
I go to court.

83
I say I am the prosecution.
我说我是检方。

84
I want him to pay me for my house.
我想让他赔偿我的房子。

85
So I'm the prosecution.
所以我是检方。

86
Okay.
好的。

87
So you're trying to not only prove that I committed the crime but also trying to get me to pay for the damage that I caused.
所以你不仅试图证明我犯了罪，还试图让我赔偿我造成的损失。

88
Exactly.
正是如此。

89
So in this case the prosecution says this man stole my wallet.
所以在这种情况下，检方说这个人偷了我的钱包。

90
He's a pickpocket.
他是个扒手。

91
And who is the pickpocket or maybe the pickpocket?

The defendant.

94
Defend defendant.

95
Think about the word here.
想想这个词。

96
To defend is to stand up for yourself, to protect yourself.
辩护就是为自己站出来，保护自己。

97
Right.
对。

98
So the defendant says, listen, no, that's not true.
所以被告说，听着，不，这不是真的。

99
I am not a pickpocket.
我不是扒手。

100
I didn't do that.
我没有做过。

101
So we have the prosecution and the defense.
所以我们有控方和辩方。

102
Okay.
好的。

103
And the person who might be guilty, the person who did the thing or didn't do the thing is called the defendant.
可能有罪的人，做了事情或没做事情的人叫被告。

104
Okay.
好的。

105
So in your example again about the crime that maybe I burnt your house down or I didn't, I would be the defendant and my lawyers would constitute my defense.
所以在你的例子中，关于我可能烧了你的房子，或者我没有，我就是被告，我的律师构成了我的辩护。

106
Yeah, they are your defense.
是的，他们是你的辩护。

107
Okay.
好的。

108
Okay.
好的。

109
So very technical words, but the important thing to remember here is defendant.
所以这些是非常专业的词，但这里重要的是被告。

110
All right, good.
好的，很好。

111
So now we have one key element that is also a person.
现在我们有一个关键元素，也是一个人。

112
We have the witness.
我们有证人。

113
Right.
对。

114
So the basic idea, like you said, is we have to tell a story.
所以基本的想法，正如你所说，我们必须讲一个故事。

115
My story is that you burned down my house and you say, no, I didn't prove it.
我的故事是你烧了我的房子，而你说，不，我没有，证明一下。

116
I say, I can.
我说，我可以。

117
Someone saw you with a lighter.
有人看到你拿着打火机。

118
Okay.
好的。

119
So this person is my witness.
所以这个人是我的证人。

120
That means that he or she saw what happened.
这意味着他或她看到了发生的事情。

121
So someone who sees a crime is a witness to that crime.
所以看到犯罪的人是该犯罪的证人。

122
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

123
So a lot of people are in the courtroom.
所以法庭上有很多人。

124
A lot of things are happening.
发生了很多事情。

125
So I think we should listen to the dialogue again.
所以我认为我们应该再听一次对话。

126
And we'll be back to look at some more words on language takeaway part two.
然后我们会回来看看语言收获第二部分的一些词。

127

现在我们要看看语言收获的第二部分，我们有另一组四个词想要看看。

160
Language takeaway.
语言收获。

161
Alright, the first is actually two words.
好的，第一个实际上是两个词。

162
We have two opposites.

166
Innocent.
无辜。

167
What does this mean?

168
So if he is innocent, that means he did not commit the crime.

169
He is not responsible for what happened.
他对发生的事情不负责任。

170
He did not steal the wallets.

Right.
对。

173
They can't do anything.
他们什么都做不了。

174
They can't do anything wrong.
他们不能做错任何事情。

175
Right.
对。

176
So guilty would be the opposite.
所以有罪就是相反的。

177
That's right.
没错。

178
So usually when someone is guilty, they're sad.
所以通常当某人有罪时，他们会感到悲伤。

179
They feel bad.
他们感到不好。

180
You want them to pay you.
你希望他们赔偿你。

181
And they go to jail.

183
If you burn down my house, of course you're going to go to jail.
如果你烧了我的房子，当然你会入狱。

184
Right.
对。

185
Alright, so guilty means you did a crime.
好的，所以有罪意味着你犯了罪。

186
You did a bad thing.
你做了坏事。

187
So we talked about the prosecution and the defense of the defendant.
所以我们谈到了控方和被告的辩护。

188
And what happens is they also present some key elements that will prove if the person is innocent or guilty.
发生的事情是他们还会提出一些关键元素，以证明这个人是无辜还是有罪。

189
And those elements are called evidence.
这些元素被称为证据。

190
That's right.
没错。

191
So back to this idea, we tell a story.
所以回到这个想法，我们讲一个故事。

192
Maybe a witness can help us tell our story.
也许证人可以帮助我们讲述我们的故事。

193
But as you say, evidence is stuff.
但正如你所说，证据是东西。

194
It's things.
它是物品。

195
So in the case of the house, I could say you have matches and you smell like smoke and oil.
所以在房子的案例中，我可以说你有火柴，你闻起来像烟和油。

196
This is evidence for me to use to show that you are guilty.
这是我用来证明你有罪的证据。

197
Right.
对。

198
So in this case, do we have any evidence?
所以在这种情况下，我们有证据吗？

199
There's no evidence, says the defendant.
被告说没有证据。

200
Right.

Alright, so evidence is proof.
好吧，证据就是证明。

202
It's proof.
这是证明。

203
It's physical proof.
这是实物证据。

204
Yeah, and most of the times when you see movies or TV shows, they will find a, I don't know, like maybe a fingerprint.
是的，而且大多数时候，当你看电影或电视节目时，他们会找到一个，我不知道，可能是指纹。

205
That's evidence.

206
Or somebody's glasses.
或者某人的眼镜。

207
A cell phone.
一部手机。

208
Exactly.

209
Alright, so evidence.
好吧，所以证据。

210
This is very important when you want to build a case.
当你想建立一个案件时，这非常重要。

211
Finally, at the end of a trial, we have a verdict.
最后，在审判结束时，我们有一个裁决。

212
Now what is a verdict?
裁决是什么？

213
So a verdict is a final decision or a conclusion in which the jury says, yeah, the person is guilty or he's not guilty.
裁决是陪审团说的最终决定或结论，是的，这个人有罪或他无罪。

214
He's innocent.
他是无辜的。

215
So we use this word usually to reach a verdict.
所以我们通常用这个词来达成裁决。

216
The jury reaches a verdict.
陪审团达成裁决。

217
Now it's interesting why we say to reach because a jury is not just one person.
现在有趣的是为什么我们说达成，因为陪审团不仅仅是一个人。

218
A jury is many people.
陪审团是许多人。

219
And so these people have to decide together.
所以这些人必须一起决定。

220
They have to argue.
他们必须争论。

221
They have to make a conclusion that everyone agrees on.
他们必须得出一个大家都同意的结论。

222
And this is to reach a conclusion, to reach a verdict because they travel there.
这就是达成结论，达成裁决，因为他们一起去。

223
They have to go together and figure it out.
他们必须一起去弄清楚。

224
Right.
对。

225
That's very, very important.
这非常非常重要。

226
So the jury reaches a verdict.
所以陪审团达成裁决。

227
And we did have one other phrase.
我们还有另一个短语。

228
It's very interesting.
这很有趣。

229
It doesn't quite fit with the other ones.
它与其他的并不完全吻合。

230
We heard this phrase from the defendant.
我们从被告那里听到了这个短语。

231
The lawyer says, so these so-called witnesses didn't actually see anything.
律师说，这些所谓的证人实际上什么也没看到。

232
What is so-called?
所谓的是什么？

233
So he's being sarcastic when he uses this phrase.
所以他在使用这个短语时是讽刺的。

234
So called, right?
所谓的，对吧？

235
That's why even his tone changes, these so-called witnesses.
这就是为什么即使他的语气也改变了，这些所谓的证人。

236
So it's a way of expressing sarcasm.
所以这是一种表达讽刺的方式。

237
He's saying they say they're witnesses, but they're not really because they didn't see anything.
他在说他们说自己是证人，但实际上并不是，因为他们什么也没看到。

238
Right, so so-called means you say that they are, but they're not really.
对，所以所谓的意思是你说他们是，但他们实际上并不是。

239
Right.
对。

240
I could also say your so-called lawyer thinks he can help you, but he can't.
我也可以说你所谓的律师认为他可以帮助你，但他不能。

241
Right.
对。

242
That means I don't think your lawyer is very good.
这意味着我认为你的律师并不好。

243
I don't think he's a real lawyer.
我认为他不是一个真正的律师。

244
Right, or sometimes people say my so-called friend stood me up last night.
对，或者有时人们会说我所谓的朋友昨晚放我鸽子。

245
Oh, so it's not really a friend.
哦，所以他并不是真正的朋友。

246
He's not really a friend, exactly.
他并不是真正的朋友，正是如此。

247
So-called.
所谓的。

248
All right, that's another good one.
好吧，这又是一个好例子。

249
Let's listen to this dialogue one more time.
让我们再听一遍这个对话。

250
Really think about some of the words you heard today, and we'll be back in a moment.
真的要考虑一下你今天听到的一些词，我们马上回来。

251

So now, a very interesting situation with the courtroom dramas.
现在，法庭戏剧的一个非常有趣的情况。

280
And I've heard that all the people in the jury have to agree in order for them to reach a verdict, right?
我听说陪审团的所有人必须达成一致才能达成裁决，对吗？

281
So if one of them is not convinced that the person is, for example, guilty, then they have to keep on deliberating.
所以如果他们中的一个人不相信这个人是，例如，有罪的，那么他们必须继续讨论。

282
That's the word, right?
这是那个词，对吧？

283
That's right.
没错。

284
So basically, the jury is always alone in a room.
所以基本上，陪审团总是单独在一个房间里。

285
Maybe they have a guard, but they're not supposed to talk to journalists or friends of the defendant or anyone because their decision is supposed to be pure.
也许他们有一个警卫，但他们不应该与记者或被告的朋友或任何人交谈，因为他们的决定应该是纯粹的。

286
So they talk, and sometimes it takes 10 minutes.
所以他们会交谈，有时需要10分钟。

287
Everyone agrees this person is guilty, or this person is innocent, but sometimes they don't agree.
每个人都同意这个人有罪，或者这个人是无辜的，但有时他们不同意。

288
And it can be one day, two days, a week, two weeks, a month trying to decide what to do.
