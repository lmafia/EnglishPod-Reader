8
But before, we have to call them to make sure that there is a space or room available for us.
但在此之前，我们必须打电话确认是否有空位。

9
All right, so we're going to hear a conversation between a person at a restaurant who works there and a person who would like to go to that restaurant.

14
We heard a different noun.

15
We heard this bistro.
我们听到了“小酒馆”。

16
That's right.
没错。

17
The name of the restaurant is actually Bruno Bistro.

18
So this restaurant, the type of restaurant this is, it's actually a bistro.
所以这家餐厅的类型实际上是小酒馆。

19
That's right.
没错。

20
So Bruno is a name, like Marco or Catherine.

21
But bistro is actually a special kind of small restaurant.
但小酒馆实际上是一种特殊的小餐厅。

22
And I believe it comes from France, right?
我相信它源自法国，对吗？

但它不是一家大餐厅。

27

Right, right.

29
Which usually, I found it means that it's more expensive for some reason.
我发现这通常意味着某种原因下更贵。

30
Because it's a bistro, it's automatically more expensive.

So as you see there, we have a verb there, to make.
如你所见，我们有一个动词，预订。

39
We want to make a reservation.

40
So let's take a look at the noun, a reservation.

43
So this word means to ask the restaurant to hold your seats.

45

51
You call to make a reservation, or you want to make a reservation.
你打电话预订，或者你想要预订。

52
That's right.

53
So the verb is to make.

54
So I could say, for example, hey, Marco, can you please make a reservation for dinner tonight?
我可以说，比如，嘿，Marco，你能帮我预订今晚的晚餐吗？

55
I'm afraid there might not be any tables left if we wait.

非常好。

58
Now we can use the verb reserve as well, right?

So I can say, hey, Marco, can you please reserve a table for dinner tonight?

65
But you have to say, reserve a table.
但你必须说“保留一个桌子”。

66
You can't say, I would like to reserve, please.
你不能说“我想预订，请”。

67
No.

72
So I'm going to reserve a table.

74
Now moving on to another verb, the waiter or the person in charge there asked us, how many people will attend dinner tonight?

75
So how many people will attend?

This is another verb.

To attend means to be there or to come.

80
That's right.
没错。

81
So it's actually a nicer way of saying to come.
所以这实际上是一个更好的说法，表示“来”。

82
Instead of him saying, how many people will come tonight, he says, how many people will attend?
他没有说，今晚有多少人会来，而是说，今晚有多少人会参加？

83
All right.
好的。

84
So that's a question for the person making the reservation.
所以这是给预订者的问题。

85
How many people total?

86
Right.
对。

87
But it's, like you say, very polite.

Quite a simple verb, but just remember that it means to come or to be present at.

All right.

95
Great.

96
So let's take a look at our dialogue again, and then we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.
所以让我们再看看我们的对话，然后我们稍后会回来进行流利度训练。

97
Bruno Bistro, how may I help you?
Bruno Bistro，我能帮您什么？

98
Yes, hello.
是的，您好。

99
I would like to make a reservation, please.
我想预订一个位置。

100
Certainly, sir.
当然，先生。

101
For which day and time, please?
请问是哪一天和时间？

102
Tonight at seven.
今晚七点。

103
I'm sorry, sir, but we are fully booked tonight until eight.
对不起，先生，但我们今晚的预订已满，直到八点。

104
In that case, eight o'clock is fine.
那么，八点可以。

105
Very well.
非常好。

106
And how many people will attend tonight?
今晚有多少人参加？

107
Four people.

108
Lastly, may I please know what name I should make the reservation under?
最后，请问我应该用什么名字来预订？

109
Mark.
马克。

110
All right.
好的。

111
We've picked out three phrases for you.
我们为您挑选了三个短语。

112
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.
现在让我们在流利度提升中看看这些。

113
Fluency Builder All right.
流利度提升，好的。

114
So the first phrase we have on Fluency Builder is actually a phrase you don't want to hear when you're trying to make a reservation.
所以我们在流利度提升中第一个短语实际上是一个您在尝试预订时不想听到的短语。

115
The person at the restaurant, the bistro, said, I'm sorry, we're fully booked until eight.
餐厅的工作人员说，对不起，我们今晚的预订已满，直到八点。

116
That's right.
没错。

117
So a place that is fully booked or maybe a flight that's fully booked means that it's completely full.
所以一个完全预订的地方，或者一个完全预订的航班，意味着它已经满了。

118
There are no available seats or available spots or anything.
没有可用的座位或位置。

119
All the tables have been reserved.
所有的桌子都已被预订。

120
All right.
好的。

121
So this means that we have to change either the day or the time.
所以这意味着我们必须更改日期或时间。

122
That's right.
没错。

123
It's fully booked.
它已满。

124
But the nice thing is that after eight o'clock is not fully booked.
但好的一点是，八点之后并没有满。

125
There are free tables after eight.
八点之后有空桌子。

126
That's right.
没错。

127
So he actually went on to say an interesting phrase to start that sentence.
所以他实际上接着说了一个有趣的短语来开始那个句子。

128
He said, in that case, eight o'clock is fine.
他说，既然如此，八点可以。

129
In that case... So in that case is a great phrase to use when you're having a conversation with someone or a negotiation because it's something that we say when the situation, like reserving a table, is not exactly the way we hoped it would be.
既然如此……所以“既然如此”是一个在与某人交谈或谈判时很好的短语，因为这是我们在情况，比如预订桌子，不完全如我们所希望时所说的。

130
So with today's dialogue, we wanted to book a table at seven o'clock.
所以在今天的对话中，我们想在七点预订一个桌子。

131
There was no table.
没有桌子。

132
So in that case, in that situation, because it changed from what we thought, we had to book a table at eight instead.
所以在这种情况下，因为情况与我们想的不同，我们不得不在八点预订一个桌子。

133
That's right.
没错。

134
So it's usually a response to information that was given to you, right?
所以这通常是对您所获得信息的回应，对吗？

135
So they say, oh, I'm sorry, there are no tickets available for the zoo today, only for tomorrow.
所以他们说，哦，对不起，今天动物园没有票，只有明天有。

136
In that case, why don't we go tomorrow?
那么，为什么我们不明天去呢？

137
That's right.
没错。

138
So I wanted to go today, but the situation changed, or there's a problem.
所以我想今天去，但情况改变了，或者有问题。

139
In that case, let's change our plans.
那么，既然如此，让我们改变计划。

140
That's right.
没错。

141
And lastly, the waiter asked, may I please know what name I should make the reservation under?
最后，服务员问，我可以知道我应该用什么名字来预订吗？

142
What name I should make the reservation under?
我应该用什么名字来预订？

143
All right, now, to make a reservation, we already learned this phrase.
好的，现在，为了预订，我们已经学过这个短语。

144
It means to reserve a table.
这意味着预订一个桌子。

145
Now, to make a reservation under a person's name, this is quite different, right?
现在，以一个人的名字来预订，这很不同，对吗？

146
This means that we're going to save a table, reserve a table, but we have to provide a name.
这意味着我们将保存一个桌子，预订一个桌子，但我们必须提供一个名字。

147
So if we say, okay, one table reserved for four, we don't know who.
所以如果我们说，好吧，一个桌子为四人预订，我们不知道是谁。

148
So this is the name that you will give the waiter when you arrive at the restaurant.
所以这是您到达餐厅时会告诉服务员的名字。

149
That's right.
没错。

150
So that is your table, basically, and that's your reservation.
所以这基本上是您的桌子，这就是您的预订。

151
So if you go to the restaurant, you say, hello, I have a reservation under the name of Mark.
所以如果您去餐厅，您说，您好，我有一个以马克的名字预订的桌子。

152
That's right.
没错。

153
I have a reservation under the name Mark, or I have a reservation for Mark at 8 o'clock.
我有一个以马克的名字预订的桌子，或者我有一个八点的马克的预订。

154
Now, when they ask the question, they're going to say, what name should we make the reservation under?
现在，当他们问这个问题时，他们会说，我们应该用什么名字来预订？

155
That's because... So just think about it as when they make the reservation, and then they have this big book.
这是因为……所以想象一下，当他们进行预订时，他们有一本大书。

156
They write your name, and underneath they write the time.
他们写下您的名字，然后在下面写下时间。

157
What name should we make the reservation under?
我们应该用什么名字来预订？

158
That's right.
没错。

159
Okay.
好的。

160
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab and some really good phrases, so let's listen to the dialogue one last time.
所以我们已经看了很多词汇和一些非常好的短语，所以让我们最后再听一次对话。

161
Bruno Bistro, how may I help you?

For which day and time, please?
请问是哪一天和时间？

今晚七点。

167
I'm sorry, sir, but we are fully booked tonight until 8.

那么，八点可以。

169
Very well.
非常好。

170
And how many people will attend tonight?
今晚有多少人参加？

171
Four people.
四个人。

172
Lastly, may I please know what name I should make the reservation under?

174
Language takeaway.
语言收获。

175
All right, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

176
So making a reservation.
所以预订。

177
Now, this is fairly easy.
现在，这相当简单。

178
This is basically what you're going to experience if you call any restaurant to make a reservation, right?
这基本上是您拨打任何餐厅进行预订时会经历的事情，对吗？

179
That's right, and it's really important to know how to respond because I know in other languages, sometimes you reserve seats instead of tables.
没错，知道如何回应真的很重要，因为我知道在其他语言中，有时您预订的是座位而不是桌子。

180
And so in English, we reserve or we book a table.
所以在英语中，我们预订或预定一个桌子。

181
Now, sometimes you will call a place and you'll say, well, I'd like to make a reservation, and they will say, I'm sorry, we don't accept reservations.
现在，有时您会拨打一个地方，您会说，我想预订一个位置，他们会说，对不起，我们不接受预订。

182
Yes, this is actually a very frustrating situation, especially if a restaurant or bistro is very popular.
是的，这实际上是一个非常令人沮丧的情况，尤其是如果一个餐厅或小酒馆非常受欢迎。

183
Right.
没错。

184
Because if they don't accept reservations, we don't make reservations, that means that you have to go to the restaurant and maybe wait in line for a table.
因为如果他们不接受预订，我们不进行预订，这意味着您必须去餐厅，可能要排队等桌子。

185
That's right.
没错。

186
That's called, I think, first come, first served, right?
这被称为，我想，先到先得，对吗？

187
That's right.
没错。

188
First come, first served.
先到先得。

189
So that means that the first people to arrive at the restaurant are the first people to get a table.
所以这意味着最早到达餐厅的人是最先获得桌子的人。

190
So it's smart to arrive early.
所以提前到达是明智的。

191
That's right.
没错。

192
So that's what happens now.
所以现在发生的就是这样。

193
There are certain restaurants where you can't make a reservation or different... we took a look at a bistro.
有些餐厅您无法进行预订，或者不同……我们看了一个小酒馆。

194
There's another one, for example, very popular in the US, a diner.
还有另一个，例如，在美国非常受欢迎的餐馆。

195
A diner.
餐馆。

196
Now this is not a place you need to make a reservation for.
现在这不是一个需要预约的地方。

197
Normally a diner is a very casual place to eat.
通常餐馆是一个非常随意的用餐地方。

198
You can go at 9 o'clock in the morning for breakfast.
你可以早上9点去吃早餐。

199
It's not very fancy at all.
这地方一点也不华丽。

200
Right.
对。

201
And it's open, I think, 24 hours usually.
我想它通常是24小时营业。

202
Many of them are open 24 hours.
许多地方都是24小时开放的。

203
And that's why I say it's not a place you need to worry about a reservation because they're usually popular at certain times but like 7 o'clock for breakfast or 12 o'clock for lunch.
这就是我说的，不用担心预约，因为它们通常在某些时间很受欢迎，比如早上7点吃早餐或中午12点吃午餐。

204
But you can usually get a table.
但你通常可以找到桌子。

205
Right.
对。
