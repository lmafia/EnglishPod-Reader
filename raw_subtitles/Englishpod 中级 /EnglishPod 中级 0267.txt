39
Why don't we take a look at those on Language Takeaway.

40
Language Takeaway So, Marco, the first word is one that you've already said a couple of times in today's lesson.
Language Takeaway 所以，Marco，第一个词是你今天已经说过几次的。

41
It is to transfer.

Okay, that's right.
没错。

43

44
So, to transfer, what does this verb mean?
那么，转账这个动词是什么意思？

45
So, to transfer means to move from one place to another.

46
In the case of money, you're moving money from one bank to another bank or from one account to another account.
在钱的情况下，您是将钱从一个银行转到另一个银行，或从一个账户转到另一个账户。

47
So, just think of transferring as moving.

48
That's right.
没错。

49
But the bank teller also mentioned something about a wire transfer.
但是银行出纳员还提到了电汇。

50
So, that's basically the same thing, right?
所以，这基本上是同样的事情，对吗？

51
That's right.
没错。

52
So, when you're talking about money, you don't actually take a bag of money and you don't walk to another bank to put it in the account.
所以，当您谈论钱时，您实际上并不是拿着一袋钱走到另一个银行去存入账户。

53
A wire transfer means that the transfer is electronic.
电汇意味着转账是电子的。

54
One bank tells another bank that you're going to exchange this money.
一家银行告诉另一家银行您将要交换这笔钱。

55
So, it's going to move from one person to another person or from one company to another company.
所以，它将从一个人转到另一个人，或从一家公司转到另一家公司。

56
But it's never actually the money itself.
但它从来不是实际的钱。

57
It's always just the number of funds in the account.
它总是账户中的资金数量。

58
That's right.
没错。

59
Okay.
好的。

60
So, a wire transfer, to transfer money electronically from one account to another.
所以，电汇是指从一个账户电子转账到另一个账户。

61
And talking about this word, account, we're talking about a bank account.
说到这个词，账户，我们指的是银行账户。

62
What is this?
这是什么？

63
Well, this is really important even if you're not making a wire transfer or if you're not working at a bank.
嗯，这真的很重要，即使您不进行电汇或不在银行工作。

64
This is something that most people have for their personal use.
这是大多数人个人使用的东西。

65
So, an account is a space for money in a bank that's kind of registered to one person or one company.
所以，账户是银行中为一个人或一家公司注册的资金空间。

66
And there are many, many different kinds of accounts.
而且有很多不同种类的账户。

67
That's right.
没错。

68
Many of you probably have a savings account.
你们中的许多人可能有一个储蓄账户。

69
This is where you keep your money to save for the future.
这是您存钱以备未来的地方。

70
Or many companies or people have a checking account or a default account where basically you put money in but you're also taking money out and paying for bills and paying to go to the movies, etc.
或者许多公司或个人有支票账户或默认账户，基本上是您存钱，但也取钱并支付账单、看电影等。

71
Yeah.
是的。

72
So, these different accounts have different rules.
所以，这些不同的账户有不同的规则。

73
They have rules about how much money you can keep in them or how much money you need to open them.
它们有关于您可以在其中保留多少资金或您需要开设它们的资金多少的规则。

74
So, the basic word here is account.
所以，这里基本的词是账户。

75
And just remember that companies and people can all have accounts at a bank.
只需记住公司和个人都可以在银行拥有账户。

76
That's right.
没错。

77
Okay.
好的。

78
So, when talking about an account, we're talking about transferring money to another account.
所以，当谈论账户时，我们谈论的是将钱转到另一个账户。

79
We don't say we want to transfer money.
我们不说我们想转账。

80
We say we want to transfer funds.
我们说我们想转移资金。

81
Funds.
资金。

82
So, funds, we usually say in the plural funds with an S.
所以，资金，我们通常以复数形式说资金。

83
This means money.
这意味着钱。

84
So, we're talking about transferring funds from one company to another.
所以，我们谈论的是将资金从一家公司转到另一家公司。

85
Or I could say, I need to deposit funds in my account.
或者我可以说，我需要在我的账户中存入资金。

86
That's right.
没错。

87
Now, an interesting word because funds with an S at the end, that's a plural noun as you said.
现在，一个有趣的词，因为资金以S结尾，是一个复数名词，正如你所说。

88
But if we use it in the singular, it could also be a verb, to fund.
但如果我们用它的单数形式，它也可以是一个动词，资助。

89
That's right.
没错。

90
And that means to pay for something or someone.
这意味着为某事或某人支付。

91
So, my grandfather funded my college education.
所以，我的祖父资助了我的大学教育。

92
He paid money for my college education.
他为我的大学教育支付了钱。

93
That's right.
没错。

94
Okay.
好的。

95
So, both words, either the verb or the noun, have to do with money.
所以，这两个词，无论是动词还是名词，都与钱有关。

96
And when we're talking about transferring money, we're talking about a type of transaction, right?
当我们谈论转账时，我们谈论的是一种交易，对吗？

97
A bank transfer or a wire transfer is a type of transaction.
银行转账或电汇是一种交易。

98
That's right.
没错。

99
So, a transaction is a noun and it's something that you do at a bank, for example, usually involving the exchange of money.
所以，交易是一个名词，是您在银行进行的事情，例如，通常涉及资金的交换。

100
So, a wire transfer is a kind of transaction.
所以，电汇是一种交易。

101
But also, depositing or putting money into my savings account is also a kind of transaction.
但是，把钱存入我的储蓄账户也是一种交易。

102
That's right.
对的。

103
So, a transaction is kind of like a business move or a business deal involving money.
所以，交易就像是涉及金钱的商业行为或交易。

104
For example, a transaction can also be buying a car.
例如，交易也可以是买车。

105
That's right.
对的。

106
So, the transaction is I give my money to Marco, the car salesperson, and the transaction is exchanging that money for the car.
所以，交易是我把钱给马尔科，汽车销售员，然后用那笔钱换取汽车。

107
That's right.
对的。

108
Okay.
好的。

109
And lastly, since we needed to pay a bill, we were worried that the bill would be overdue.
最后，由于我们需要支付账单，我们担心账单会逾期。

110
And that's why we really needed to make this wire transfer.
这就是我们真的需要进行这笔电汇的原因。

111
Okay.
好的。

112
So, to be overdue is to be late.
所以，逾期就是迟到。

113
So, think about due.
所以，想想到期。

114
This is the time when something has to be done by.
这是某件事情必须完成的时间。

115
So, for example, if the bill for the electricity is due on Wednesday, but I pay it on Thursday, it's overdue.
例如，如果电费账单在星期三到期，但我在星期四支付，那就是逾期。

116
Okay.
好的。

117
So, it not only has to do with money, it could also be something that is late.
所以，这不仅与金钱有关，也可以是某件事情迟到了。

118
For example, if I visit my grandma after not going there for three months, you would say this visit is long overdue.
例如，如果我三个月没去看我奶奶，你会说这次拜访是很久没去了。

119
That means Marco should have visited his grandmother earlier, but he didn't.
这意味着马尔科应该早些去看他的祖母，但他没有。

120
That's right.
对的。

121
Okay.
好的。

122
So, a lot of great vocab there, all involving banks and the different types of words you may find when transferring funds.
所以，有很多很棒的词汇，都是与银行和转账时可能遇到的不同类型的词汇有关。

123

155
I will take you through the procedure.

我们需要做的所有步骤，您需要填写文件，您需要在这里签名，等等。

161
Right, so we're talking about a wire transfer.

But still, it has different steps and different things that you must do in order to operate.

168
But when we have a bank teller who will take us through the procedure, this means that he or she will help us understand the steps we need to complete.
但是当我们有一个银行出纳员带我们了解流程时，这意味着他或她会帮助我们理解我们需要完成的步骤。

169
That's right.
对的。

170
So, we could also use this in another bank scenario, if maybe my little brother wants to open a bank account.

在这之后，我们发现这个人为什么如此急于转账。

177
The person says, I have a company account, I need to pay a bill.
这个人说，我有一个公司账户，我需要支付一笔账单。

178
So, this is why the money is going to be transferred from one place to another, to pay the bill.
所以，这就是为什么钱要从一个地方转到另一个地方，以支付账单。

179
So, this is something we say not just about, you know, company things or business things, we say about our things at home, like the electricity bill.
所以，这不仅仅是关于公司的事情或商业的事情，我们也会说到我们家里的事情，比如电费账单。

180
That's right.
对的。

181
And actually, this is more and more common.
实际上，这越来越普遍。

182
We pay our bills using our electronic banking services.

So, for example, maybe he needs to pay the electricity bill or the telephone bill and this is why we're transferring money.
例如，也许他需要支付电费账单或电话费账单，这就是我们转账的原因。

184
So, to pay a bill is to cancel the bill.

186
So, I could say, it's time to pay the bills, it's the end of the month.

And now, an interesting phrase here, very specific to making transfers, when we talk about bank routing number, a bank routing number.
现在，这里有一个有趣的短语，非常具体于进行转账，当我们谈论银行路由号码时，银行路由号码。

191
Well, this is pretty simple actually.
嗯，这其实很简单。

192
If you're going to transfer money, you need to be able to tell the bank where the money will go.
如果您要转账，您需要能够告诉银行钱将去哪里。

193
So, you can't just say Mr. Smith, you have to have a number for the account and each number is unique, it's special and it's usually very, very long.
所以，您不能仅仅说史密斯先生，您必须有账户的号码，每个号码都是唯一的，特别的，通常非常非常长。

194
That's right.
对的。

195
And actually, it also has to do with what bank it is because obviously, you can't just say, oh, Bank of USA because, you know, maybe there are two banks with the same name or maybe there's one Bank of USA in the United States and there's another one in, I don't know, in Europe.
实际上，这也与是什么银行有关，因为显然，您不能仅仅说，美国银行，因为，您知道，也许有两家同名的银行，或者也许在美国有一家美国银行，在欧洲还有一家。

196
Right, so each bank will have a certain number or letter combination in the bank routing number and so the kind of account, is it savings or is it a business account and so on and so forth, so that you know exactly where the money will go because you don't want to give the money to the wrong person.
对，所以每家银行在银行路由号码中会有特定的数字或字母组合，因此账户的类型，是储蓄账户还是商业账户等等，以便您确切知道钱将去哪里，因为您不想把钱给错人。

197
That's right.
对的。

198
Okay, so a lot of great things on this lesson.

所以马尔科，这真的非常重要，即使你不是在谈论商业背景，但你也在为个人生活进行交易。

223
Just imagine maybe you're abroad, you're in the United States, and maybe your parents need to send you money.

You can just go up to them and say, I need to transfer money or I need to transfer funds.

230
And so they will send the money from one Western Union to another Western Union.

And then the person at home or wherever will pick up your money.

The wire transferring was...

I don't think it was originally with banks.

I think it was some sort of service similar to Western Union.

238
Or maybe Western Union started it.

Yeah, something like this.
