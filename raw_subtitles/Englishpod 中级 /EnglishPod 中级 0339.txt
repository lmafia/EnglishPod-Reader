Something that many schools do is they have a conference between the teacher and the parent.
很多学校会举行教师与家长之间的会议。

7

As a teacher, it's great seeing the kids' parents assist our parent-teacher conference night.
作为一名教师，看到孩子的家长参加我们的家长教师会议真是太好了。

What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom?

23
Well, it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math.
好吧，重要的是您要和他一起复习作业，帮助他学习数学。

24
I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions.
我还建议他每周放学后参加两次辅导课程。

25
It will really help a lot.
这会有很大帮助。

26
Thanks a lot.
非常感谢。

27

32
Oh yes, I...
哦，是的，我……

33
Alright, we're back.
好吧，我们回来了。

34
So now let's take a look at some language takeaway.
现在让我们来看看一些语言要点。

35
First up in language takeaway, we have the key phrase here, which is parent-teacher conference.
首先在语言要点中，我们有一个关键短语，即家长教师会议。

36
That's right.
没错。

37
So it's a parent-teacher conference.
所以这是一个家长教师会议。

38
A parent-teacher conference.
家长教师会议。

39
And it's basically a meeting between the parent of the child and the teacher of the child.
基本上是孩子的家长和孩子的老师之间的会议。

40
And they talk about how well he is doing or she is doing or where she needs or he needs to improve.
他们讨论孩子的表现如何，或者他/她需要在哪些方面改进。

41
That's right.
没错。

42
So this is something that can happen maybe twice a year, maybe four times a year.
这可能每年发生两次，也可能四次。

43
It depends on the school, but it's just a meeting between the parents or parent of the child and his or her teacher.
这取决于学校，但这只是孩子的家长和他/她的老师之间的会议。

44
That's right.
没错。

45
So it's very common with schools in order to make sure that the parent knows how the child is doing in school and can improve maybe.
所以这在学校中非常普遍，以确保家长知道孩子在学校的表现，并能有所改进。

46
And one of the goals is to provide the parent with insight into how to help the child learn more.
其中一个目标是为家长提供如何帮助孩子更好学习的见解。

47
Okay, so insight is kind of like a better understanding of things.
好吧，见解就像是对事物的更好理解。

48
More clear picture, yeah.
更清晰的画面，是的。

49
So I could say, you know what Marco, I just don't get that woman Cindy.
所以我可以说，你知道吗，Marco，我就是不理解那个女人Cindy。

50
Can you provide some insight into why she made that decision?
你能提供一些关于她为什么做出那个决定的见解吗？

51
That's right.
没错。

52
So you want some more information or some type of explanation as to why she made that decision.
所以你想要更多的信息或某种解释，关于她为什么做出那个决定。

53
Exactly.
正是如此。

54
And so the teacher will then provide this insight by describing what he or she thinks about the student.
所以老师会通过描述他或她对学生的看法来提供这种见解。

55
That's right.
没错。

56
And well the teacher went on to say that Alan is a great student, hard worker, very well behaved.
老师接着说，Alan是个优秀的学生，努力工作，表现很好。

57
So he is a hard worker, that means he is this, it's not an adjective, it's not.
所以他是个努力工作的人，这意味着他不是形容词，不是。

58
He is a hard worker, she is a hard worker.
他是个努力工作的人，她是个努力工作的人。

59
He is very well behaved.
他表现得很好。

60
Now this is a way to describe him.
这是一种描述他的方式。

61
He is not naughty, he is well behaved.
他不是顽皮的，他表现得很好。

62
That means he doesn't start fights, he doesn't talk in class, he doesn't cheat.
这意味着他不打架，不在课堂上说话，不作弊。

63
Okay, so what would be the opposite?
好吧，那么相反的是什么？

64
You say a child or a person is well behaved, what would be the opposite?
你说一个孩子或一个人表现得很好，相反的是什么？

65
I would say the child who is not well behaved is naughty.
我会说不听话的孩子。

66
Okay, so you say he is not well behaved or just he is naughty.
好吧，所以你说他表现不好，或者只是说他顽皮。

67
He is very naughty, he always starts fights in class.
他非常顽皮，总是在课堂上打架。

68
Okay, now the student is having a little bit of problems with math.
好吧，现在学生在数学方面有一点问题。

69
So the parent asks what he can do to complement what he is learning in the classroom.
所以家长问他可以做些什么来补充他在课堂上学到的内容。

70
Okay, so to complement, you might have heard this verb before, but here it means something special.
好吧，补充，你可能以前听过这个动词，但在这里它有特别的意思。

71
It means to add to.
它意味着添加。

72
Alright, so, okay, the boy, Alan, he is learning a lot in school.
好吧，所以，Alan在学校学到了很多。

73
But maybe he is not learning enough because his math scores just aren't good enough.
但也许他学得不够，因为他的数学成绩不够好。

74
So the father wants to know what can he do in addition to school.
所以父亲想知道他可以在学校之外做些什么。

75
Right.
对。

76
You know, what can he do extra to help his boy.

That's right.

所以我们要补充某人，比如说，哦，你今天看起来不错。

80
Or this, in this situation, this verb we are saying to provide more support or extra help to something.
或者在这种情况下，这个动词我们是说提供更多支持或额外帮助。

81
That's right.
没错。

82
So I feel really good about accounting, but I want to take an extra math class to complement my accounting studies, because I'm just not very confident in my math.
所以我对会计感到很自信，但我想上额外的数学课来补充我的会计学习，因为我对数学不太自信。

83

84
Alright, so, and towards the end, well, we're talking about how the child's tuition is overdue.

90
So college tuitions in America are very expensive.

91
That's right.

A bill can be overdue.

That's right.
没错。

98
So you should have paid your bill already, but you haven't, so it's overdue.
所以您应该已经支付账单，但您还没有，所以它逾期了。

99

我觉得有时候对孩子来说甚至有点可怕，因为你的父母要去和老师谈话，可能老师不会说你好的事情。

208
Yeah, this is always very nerve-wracking for children because maybe you didn't tell your mom and dad what you got on your test in science last week and then your teacher will tell your parents and your parents will be angry.
是的，这对孩子来说总是很紧张，因为也许你没有告诉父母你上周科学考试的成绩，然后老师会告诉你的父母，你的父母会生气。

210
So this is the time when the parents can be honest with the teacher and the teacher can be honest with the parents.
所以这是父母可以和老师诚实交流的时候，老师也可以和父母诚实交流。

That's right because sometimes teachers will have a file with maybe your test scores and they will show them to your parents so not only what you get on your report cards but then you actually see the tests and it could be like you say a little nerve-wracking.
没错，因为有时候老师会有一个文件，里面可能有你的考试成绩，他们会把这些给你的父母看，所以不仅仅是你的成绩单，还有实际的考试成绩，这可能会让人感到紧张。

212
I've also heard though it can be nerve-wracking for the teacher because sometimes teachers have to tell parents things that they don't really want to know about their kids.
不过我也听说这对老师来说也可能很紧张，因为有时候老师不得不告诉父母一些他们不想知道的关于孩子的事情。

213
If the teacher says, hey, your boy Alan, he's not very good at math, maybe Alan's dad gets angry and says, yo, no, that's not true.
如果老师说，嘿，你的儿子艾伦，他数学不好，也许艾伦的爸爸会生气，说，不，这不是真的。

He's very good at math.

216
They really help the students.
他们真的帮助学生。

217
Right.
对。

218
Well, it's interesting and actually I haven't really seen parent-teacher conferences to be that common outside of the United States.
嗯，这很有趣，实际上我没有看到家长会在美国以外的地方那么普遍。

219
So maybe if you're a parent, you have attended a parent-teacher conference or maybe when you were a kid, your parents went to your parent-teacher conference.
所以也许如果你是父母，你参加过家长会，或者当你还是孩子的时候，你的父母去参加过你的家长会。
