4
That's right.
没错。

5
Today we're going to talk about a very popular subject many people believe in the horoscope.
今天我们要讨论一个很多人相信的热门话题：星座。

6
So a horoscope is basically a system, a very old system, of determining your future and describing your personality.
星座基本上是一个非常古老的系统，用来预测未来和描述个性。

7
And so it all depends on when you were born and where you were born.
这完全取决于你出生的时间和地点。

8
So what stars were in the sky when you were born.
也就是你出生时天空中的星星。

9
That's right.
没错。

10
So basically, as many of you may know, there are 12 signs.
基本上，正如你们许多人所知，有12个星座。

11
And we're going to talk about a couple of them and a little bit more about horoscopes and this... I don't know, I guess it's kind of like a branch of science?
我们将讨论其中几个，以及更多关于星座的内容……我不知道，我想这算是一种科学的分支吗？

12
Yeah, pseudoscience.
是的，伪科学。

13
Pseudoscience.
伪科学。

14
Yeah, I don't think there's much testing that's going on, but it's definitely something that a lot of people believe in.
是的，我认为没有太多测试在进行，但这绝对是很多人相信的东西。

15
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk more about it.

Looks like we'll both have interesting summers.

32
That's bogus.

33
I don't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically non-existent.
我在工作中没有感到任何压力，我的爱情生活几乎不存在。

34
This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.
这些星座的东西都是一堆胡说八道。

35
No it's not.

36
Your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality.

37
See, it says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize.

That sounds just like you.

好吧，我们回来了。

44
So a very interesting dialogue between these two girls talking about one of them believing in the horoscope and the other one doesn't.
这是两个女孩之间非常有趣的对话，一个相信星座，另一个不相信。

45
But they mentioned a lot of interesting things, so we're going to have two language takeaways today.
但他们提到了很多有趣的事情，所以今天我们将有两个语言要点。

46
Let's start with language takeaway part one.
让我们开始第一部分的语言要点。

47
Language takeaway Alright, so one of the most common things you'll hear when we talk about the horoscope in English is an outlook.
语言要点 好吧，当我们谈论星座时，你最常听到的事情之一就是运势。

48
And an outlook can be positive or negative.
运势可以是积极的或消极的。

49
So what exactly is an outlook?
那么运势到底是什么？

50
Well, if you notice Lydia said, my outlook is very positive.
嗯，如果你注意到Lydia说，我的运势非常积极。

51
So basically she's talking about her future.
所以基本上她在谈论她的未来。

52
So the way that she sees the future or the way that the horoscope talks about the future is a positive one.
她对未来的看法或星座对未来的描述是积极的。

53
So you could say, you know those eight balls?
所以你可以说，你知道那些八球吗？

54
They're black and they have like a message and you shake it and it gives you a message?
它们是黑色的，上面有信息，你摇动它，它会给你一个信息？

55
You ask a question.
你问一个问题。

56
You ask a question and it says outlook positive.
你问一个问题，它说运势积极。

57
That's right.
没错。

58
Things will either be positive or negative.
事情要么是积极的，要么是消极的。

59
So I guess you can apply it, for example, to a company.
所以我想你可以把它应用到公司上。

60
You say that a company has a positive outlook.
你说一个公司有积极的运势。

61
Or even a person.
或者甚至一个人。

62
You know, he's a very positive person, so he has a positive outlook.
你知道，他是一个非常积极的人，所以他有积极的运势。

63
He thinks good things are going to happen.
他认为好事会发生。

64
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

65
So talking about horoscopes, obviously we must mention the 12 zodiac signs.
所以谈到星座，显然我们必须提到12个星座。

66
Okay, so each month has its own sign.
好吧，每个月都有自己的星座。

67
And they're not exactly the months.
它们并不完全是月份。

68
They're a symbol.
它们是一个符号。

69
That's right.
没错。

70
So for example, a lot of August is part of the Leo sign in English.
例如，8月大部分时间属于狮子座。

71
So that's the lion.
所以那是狮子。

72
And so the lion is the animal, the zodiac.
狮子是动物，星座。

73
So the zodiac sign is one of these signs.
所以星座是这些星座之一。

74
Like Leo is one of the zodiac signs.
比如狮子是星座之一。

75
And I guess the all 12 signs are considered the zodiac or the horoscope.
我想所有12个星座都被认为是星座或运势。

76
Exactly.
没错。

77
And you can actually talk about the zodiac in terms of other cultures.
你实际上可以在其他文化中谈论星座。

78
There is a Chinese zodiac.
有中国的星座。

79
So we could say it's the year of the horse.
所以我们可以说这是马年。

80
But that's a little bit different from what we're talking about here with the Western horoscope.
但这与我们在这里谈论的西方运势有点不同。

81
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

82
So all of this actually comes down to the, as we say, the pseudoscience or the branch called astrology.
所以这一切实际上归结为，正如我们所说的，伪科学或称为占星术的分支。

83
Astrology.
占星术。

84
So this is a very hard word for some people to remember because they want to say astronomy.
这是一个对某些人来说很难记住的词，因为他们想说天文学。

85
But it's different.
但这是不同的。

86
Astronomy is the scientific study of the skies, the stars, planets, things like that.
天文学是对天空、星星、行星等的科学研究。

87
Astrology is different.
占星术是不同的。

88
It's what we're talking about here, the horoscope, and reading the stars to understand what our personal futures will hold for us.
这是我们在这里谈论的，运势，以及阅读星星以了解我们的个人未来将会发生什么。

89
That's right.
没错。

90
So astronomy is an exact science part of, I guess, physics where you talk about the stars or the composition of the stars and their movements.
所以天文学是一个精确的科学，属于我想是物理学的一部分，谈论星星或星星的组成及其运动。

91
Whereas in astrology we're talking about zodiacs and horoscopes and basically what star was in the sky when you were born, but in a different way.
而在占星术中，我们谈论的是星座和运势，基本上是你出生时天空中的星星，但以不同的方式。

92
It's not very scientific.
这并不是很科学。

93
That's right.
没错。

94
So astrology is normally what you would see in the newspaper when you're trying to find your horoscope, astrology or horoscope.
所以占星术通常是你在报纸上看到的，当你试图找到你的运势时，占星术或运势。

95
And actually every time you read the newspaper, if you look up your zodiac sign, it makes a prediction about your day or your week or maybe even sometimes a month or year.
实际上每次你阅读报纸时，如果你查找你的星座，它会对你的一天、一周，甚至有时一个月或一年做出预测。

96
That's right.
没错。

97
And so a prediction is basically a guess about what will happen for you.
所以预测基本上是对你将会发生什么的猜测。

98
That's right.
没错。

99
So many times you see that the horoscope will say, finances are in trouble.
所以很多时候你会看到运势说，财务有麻烦。

100
Be careful with how you spend your money.
小心你的花费。

101
So they're making a prediction that in the future maybe you're going to have money problems, so you have to be careful.
所以他们在预测未来你可能会有经济问题，所以你必须小心。

102
Exactly.
正是如此。

103
Or in the dialogue, you will have a passionate summer fling.
或者在对话中，你会有一个热情的夏季恋情。

104
This is a prediction.
这是一个预测。

105
It has not yet happened.
这还没有发生。

106
It will happen.
它会发生。

107
That's right.
没错。

108
That's right.
没错。

109
A prediction.
一个预测。

110
So now talking a little bit more about the zodiac signs that we saw in the dialogue, we mentioned two, Aries and Capricorn.
现在再谈谈我们在对话中看到的星座，我们提到了两个，白羊座和摩羯座。

111
So a lot of people who believe in astrology say that astrological signs are broken up.
很多人相信占星术，认为星座是分开的。

112
They're divided into different kinds of sign.
它们被分为不同类型的星座。

113
We have water signs, air signs, earth signs and fire signs.
我们有水象星座、风象星座、土象星座和火象星座。

114
One of the famous fire signs is Aries, right?
著名的火象星座之一是白羊座，对吧？

115
Aries.
白羊座。

116
It's like the god of war in the Greek mythology.
它就像希腊神话中的战神。

117
That's right.
没错。

118
And so it's pronounced Aries, Aries.
所以它的发音是白羊座，白羊座。

119
A-R-I-E-S.
A-R-I-E-S。

120
Aries.
白羊座。

121
That's right.
没错。

122
And the other one is a Capricorn.
另一个是摩羯座。

123
Capricorn.
摩羯座。

124
So that's like a goat?
那是像山羊吗？

125
Yeah, it's kind of like a ram.
是的，有点像公羊。

126
A ram.
一只公羊。

127
It's like an earth sign.
它是一个土象星座。

128
That's right.
没错。

129
So there are 12.
所以一共有12个。

130
These are just two of them.
这只是其中两个。

131
And obviously there are a lot more.
显然还有很多。

132
I guess off the top of my head, we have Taurus or Leo.
我想起的有金牛座或狮子座。

133
There's also a Scorpio.
还有天蝎座。

134
Sagittarius.
射手座。

135
Sagittarius.
射手座。

136
Gemini.
双子座。

137
Gemini, which are like twins, twin people.
双子座，就像双胞胎，双胞胎的人。

138
There's Pisces.
还有双鱼座。

139
Virgo.
处女座。

140
And Virgo the Virgin.
还有处女座。

141
And I don't know if we're missing anything.
我不知道我们是否遗漏了什么。

142
I can't think now.
我现在想不起来。

143
We'll have to talk about it at the very end of today's lesson.
我们得在今天课程的最后谈谈这个。

144
But we actually have some interesting things to talk about in a minute here.
但我们实际上有一些有趣的事情要在这里讨论。

145
We have to talk about the personality characteristics that are common when you're talking about different zodiac signs.
我们必须谈谈不同星座的共同个性特征。

146
Okay, so before we get to that, let's listen to our dialogue again.
好的，在我们谈到这个之前，让我们再听一遍我们的对话。

147
Hey, Lydia, what are you reading?
嘿，莉迪亚，你在读什么？

148
I'm looking at my horoscope for this month.
我在看这个月的星座运势。

149
My outlook is very positive.

150
It says that I should take a vacation to some place exotic and that I will have a passionate summer fling.

151
What are you talking about?
你在说什么？

让我看看。

153
What are horoscopes?
什么是星座运势？

154
It's a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign.
它是根据你的星座对你这个月的预测。

155
You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in.
你有一个不同的星座，取决于你出生的月份和日期。

156
I was born on April 15th, so I'm an Aries.
我出生在4月15日，所以我是白羊座。

157

让我看看。

160
You're a Capricorn.

161
It says that you'll be feeling stress at work, but you could see new exciting developments in your love life.
它说你会感到工作压力，但你可能会在爱情生活中看到新的令人兴奋的发展。

162
Looks like we'll both have interesting summers.
看起来我们两个都会有有趣的夏天。

163
That's bogus.
这太荒谬了。

164
I don't feel any stress at work, and my love life is practically non-existent.
我在工作中没有感到任何压力，我的爱情生活几乎不存在。

165
This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.
这些星座的东西都是一堆胡说八道。

166
No, it's not.
不，不是的。

167
Your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality.
你的星座可以告诉你很多关于你个性的信息。

168
See?
看吧？

169
It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize.
它说白羊座是充满活力并且喜欢社交的。

170
Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they're so broad they could apply to anyone.
嗯，你确实符合这些标准，但它们太宽泛了，适用于任何人。

171
What does it say about me?
它对我说了什么？

172
A Capricorn is serious minded and practical.
摩羯座是严肃和务实的。

173
She likes to do things in conventional ways.
她喜欢以传统的方式做事。

174
That sounds just like you.
听起来就像你。

175
All right, we're back.
好吧，我们回来了。

176
So now let's take a look at these personality traits on language takeaway part two.
现在让我们看看这些个性特征在语言收获第二部分。

177
Language takeaway.
语言收获。

178
All right, so one of the great words that we heard in today's dialogue was exotic, okay?
好的，今天对话中我们听到的一个很棒的词是异国情调的，对吧？

179
And this is not necessarily describing a person, but usually things or clothes or places.
这并不一定是描述一个人，而通常是指事物、衣服或地方。

180
And in this instance, it was some place exotic.
在这种情况下，它是一个异国情调的地方。

181
That's right.
没错。

182
What's an exotic place?
什么是异国情调的地方？

183
It's basically a place that's very unique, and I guess it's kind of not common to go there or to find.
基本上是一个非常独特的地方，我想去那里或找到那里的人并不常见。

184
For example, many people talk about an exotic getaway going to the jungle, because it's so exotic.
例如，很多人谈论去丛林的异国情调的度假，因为它是如此异国情调。

185
You have so many strange animals and plants and everything is so unfamiliar.
你有很多奇怪的动物和植物，一切都如此陌生。

186
Right.
对。

187
So in my mind, Tahiti is very exotic.
所以在我看来，塔希提是非常异国情调的。

188
All right, it's full of jungle and there's also beaches, and it's very unusual for someone who's from America because it's just so far away.
好吧，那里满是丛林，还有海滩，对于来自美国的人来说非常不寻常，因为它实在太远了。

189
That's right.
没错。

190
Exotic.
异国情调。

191
So someone can also have an exotic personality because maybe they're a little bit strange, or not strange, but not so common, maybe unique.
所以一个人也可以有异国情调的个性，因为他们可能有点奇怪，或者不奇怪，但不那么常见，可能是独特的。

192
Yeah, although exotic is usually kind of a sexy thing when you're talking about people.
是的，尽管当你谈论人时，异国情调通常是有点性感的。

193
That's right.
没错。

194
She looks very exotic.
她看起来非常异国情调。

195
That means she doesn't look like everybody else here.
这意味着她看起来和这里的每个人都不一样。

196
That's right.
没错。

197
But another adjective to describe someone's personality is somebody that's very energetic.
但描述某人个性的另一个形容词是非常充满活力的。

198
All right, so energetic sounds like the word energy.
好吧，充满活力听起来像是能量这个词。

199
That's because they're related.
这是因为它们是相关的。

200
And so someone who is energetic has lots of energy.
所以一个充满活力的人有很多能量。

201
He or she likes to do a lot of things and wants to always go places.
他或她喜欢做很多事情，并且总是想去不同的地方。

202
And you know the energetic person at your office.
你知道你办公室里的那个有活力的人。

203
They always drink coffee.
他们总是喝咖啡。

204
That's right.
没错。

205
Maybe they make everyone else really tired just listening to them.
也许光是听他们说话就让其他人感到疲惫。

206
That's right.
没错。

207
And actually a person that's energetic usually also loves to socialize.
其实一个有活力的人通常也喜欢社交。

208
That's right.
没错。

209
So loves to means they like to, but they like it a lot, right?
所以喜欢社交意味着他们很喜欢，但非常喜欢，对吧？

210
But to socialize means to talk to other people or to go to parties or to meet new people.
但社交意味着与其他人交谈，参加聚会或结识新朋友。

211
So if it's a verb, to socialize means to talk to people, to meet people, to greet people.
所以如果是动词，社交意味着与人交谈，见面，问候。

212
You love to have contact with other people.
你喜欢与其他人接触。

213
So yeah, you're right.
所以是的，你说得对。

214
Very, very common for people who are energetic.
对于有活力的人来说，这非常常见。

215
Okay.
好的。

216
And what about someone that's practical?
那么，实用的人呢？

217
What is that like?
那是什么样的？

218
Someone who is practical does a lot of things.
实用的人做很多事情。

219
Maybe someone who's practical always comes to their activities prepared.
也许实用的人总是为他们的活动做好准备。

220
So in my car, I'm very practical.
所以在我的车里，我非常实用。

221
I have extra water and a spare tire.
我有额外的水和一个备用轮胎。

222
But you can also say, I'm a very practical person.
但你也可以说，我是一个非常实用的人。

223
I like to do things that I can achieve as opposed to someone who always wants to do things that they can't really achieve.
我喜欢做我能实现的事情，而不是总想做那些我无法实现的事情。

224
Okay.
好的。

225
So a practical person is usually very realistic and very down to earth.
所以一个实用的人通常非常现实，非常脚踏实地。

226
Maybe someone that's practical, if they're going on a trip, they'll only take what's necessary, not more than they need.
也许实用的人如果去旅行，他们只会带必要的东西，而不是超过他们需要的。

227
Yeah, exactly.
是的，正是如此。

228
Let me give you a good example.
让我给你一个好例子。

229
I like to go hiking.
我喜欢徒步旅行。

230
And sometimes I see women who have not made very practical decisions about the shoes they wear.
有时我看到一些女性在鞋子的选择上没有做出非常实用的决定。

231
So I like to wear hiking boots.
所以我喜欢穿登山靴。

232
These are very practical.
这些非常实用。

233
Wearing high heels on a mountain is not very practical.
在山上穿高跟鞋并不是很实用。

234
That's right.
没错。

235
Okay.
好的。

236
Very good.
非常好。

237
Now, we also mentioned that a Capricorn is serious minded and conventional in many ways.
现在，我们还提到过摩羯座在许多方面是严肃和传统的。

238
Someone who's serious minded maybe doesn't like to have fun and go out and do things that are silly.
一个严肃的人可能不喜欢玩乐，不喜欢外出做傻事。

239
Someone who's serious minded is usually very practical, I think, and really has a goal, wants to achieve that goal.
我认为一个严肃的人通常非常实用，并且真的有一个目标，想要实现那个目标。

240
No time to be silly, no time to make jokes.
没时间去傻笑，没时间开玩笑。

241
So it doesn't necessarily mean that the person is boring, but they're just very, as you said, practical.
所以这并不一定意味着这个人无聊，但他们确实非常，正如你所说，实用。

242
And what about that a Capricorn also likes to do things in conventional ways?
那么摩羯座也喜欢以传统的方式做事情呢？

243
All right, so doing something in a conventional way means that you're doing it in a traditional way.
好的，所以以传统的方式做某事意味着你以传统的方式去做。

244
So this is a thing we've always done.
这是一件我们一直以来都这样做的事情。

245
We've always done it in this way, and I'm going to continue to do it in this way.
我们一直以这种方式做，我将继续以这种方式做。

246
So the opposite is unconventional.
所以相反的是非传统的。

247
That means doing things in new ways, doing things with your imagination.
这意味着以新的方式做事情，运用你的想象力做事情。

248
And so something that's very conventional is something that has been established, and we're just going to continue doing it that way.
所以非常传统的事情是已经建立的事情，我们将继续以这种方式做。

249
So for example, someone that gets married in a church is the conventional way, but someone that gets married while skydiving is very unconventional.
例如，在教堂结婚是传统的方式，但在跳伞时结婚是非常非传统的。

250
That's right.
没错。

251
Unconventional.
非传统。

252
Absolutely.
绝对正确。

253
Very good.
非常好。

254
So a lot of great vocab here.
所以这里有很多很棒的词汇。

255
Why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time, and we'll be back to talk with you a little bit more.
我们再听一遍对话，然后我们会回来和你聊更多。

256
Hey, Lydia, what are you reading?
