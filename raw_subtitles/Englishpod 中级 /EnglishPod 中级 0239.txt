我真的不觉得我准备好要跳进满是尖锐岩石的河里，坐在橡皮艇上，或者在一个由超大气球支撑的柳条篮子里飞上天。

36
So obviously this tour agency or tour operator has a lot of different options, a lot of them exciting.
显然，这家旅游公司或旅游运营商有很多不同的选择，其中许多都很刺激。

37
So why don't we take a look at some of those on language takeaway.
那么我们为什么不看看一些语言要点呢。

38
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

39
So the first one has to do with water.
第一个与水有关。

40
This is called white water rafting.
这叫做激流泛舟。

41
That's right.
没错。

42
So white water rafting.
所以激流泛舟。

43
Now rafting means that you go in a raft.
现在泛舟意味着您在一个筏子上。

44
That's right.
没错。

45
It's a special kind of boat, not a wooden boat, not like a big boat you see in the ocean.
这是一种特殊的船，不是木船，也不是您在海洋中看到的大船。

46
This is a special boat for rivers maybe.
这是一种专为河流设计的特殊船。

47
That's right.
没错。

48
It's an inflatable rubber boat.
这是一种充气橡皮艇。

49
So he also described it as a rubber boat.
所以他也把它描述为橡皮艇。

50
Okay, rubber is the material it's made out of.
好的，橡胶是它的材料。

51
That's right.
没错。

52
So you go in this boat in a river and it's called white water because it has rapids.
所以您在这条河里乘坐这艘船，它被称为激流，因为它有急流。

53
So the river is moving very quickly and you can see that it's a little bit dangerous to go swimming in a river like this.
所以河水流动得非常快，您可以看到在这样的河里游泳是有点危险的。

54
That's right.
没错。

55
So when the water goes really fast or when it hits some rocks, the color changes from being blue or brown to white.
所以当水流得非常快或撞到一些岩石时，颜色会从蓝色或棕色变为白色。

56
And that's why it's white water rafting.
这就是为什么它叫激流泛舟。

57
That's right.
没错。

58
It's very, very scary and very dangerous.
这非常可怕，也非常危险。

59
That's right, but very exciting.
没错，但非常刺激。

60
So that's considered an adventure sport.
所以这被认为是一种冒险运动。

61
And then the trip was followed by a ride in a hot air balloon.
然后这次旅行之后是热气球之旅。

62
Well, everyone's seen balloons before.
好吧，大家都见过气球。

63
Sometimes we give children balloons at the fair or maybe for their birthday.
有时我们在集市上或为孩子的生日送气球。

64
Balloons are basically rubber filled with air.
气球基本上是充满空气的橡胶。

65
But a hot air balloon is a very special kind of mode of transportation.
但热气球是一种非常特殊的交通工具。

66
Actually, you can travel in a hot air balloon.
实际上，您可以乘坐热气球旅行。

67
That's right.
没错。

68
It's a big, big balloon that has a basket under it.
这是一个非常大的气球，下面有一个篮子。

69
And the person actually described it as a wicker basket.
而且这个人实际上把它描述为柳条篮子。

70
A wicker is the material that's used in the basket, right?
柳条是用在篮子上的材料，对吗？

71
That's right.
没错。

72
You can have wicker furniture like wicker chairs.
您可以有柳条家具，比如柳条椅子。

73
It's just a way to basically make furniture out of this kind of bark or natural material.
这基本上是一种用这种树皮或天然材料制作家具的方法。

74
So a hot air balloon is a very big balloon and it's filled with hot air, usually by some sort of fire that's under it.
所以热气球是一个非常大的气球，里面充满热空气，通常是通过下面的某种火来加热的。

75
And because it's filled with hot air, it goes up in the air.
因为它充满热空气，所以它会上升。

76
And as you say, you can use it as transportation, maybe to go very long distances carried by the wind because there's no real way of of giving it direction or just for fun.
正如您所说，您可以将其用作交通工具，也许是被风带着去很远的地方，因为没有真正的方向控制，或者只是为了好玩。

77
That's right.
没错。

78
It's another dangerous but less dangerous kind of sport.
这是一种危险但相对不那么危险的运动。

79
But after that, we actually have one that I think you have some experience with.
但之后，我们实际上有一个我认为您有一些经验的运动。

80
It's called hang gliding.
这叫做滑翔。

81
That's right.
没错。

82
Hang gliding is it's another type of sport and also a type of flying sport.
滑翔是另一种运动，也是飞行运动的一种。

83
And basically you get on a hang glider.
基本上，您会乘坐滑翔机。

84
Okay, so if you've seen this before, you'll know that it looks like someone is wearing wings.
好吧，如果您以前见过这个，您会知道它看起来像是有人在穿着翅膀。

85
It's a big kite that looks like a triangle like a kite and you fly in it.
这是一种看起来像三角形的巨型风筝，您在里面飞行。

86
So it has no motor it has not like the hot air balloon.
所以它没有发动机，不像热气球。

87
It has no fire.
它没有火。

88
So you just basically glide it you just sail through the the air the the atmosphere sounds very peaceful.
所以您基本上是在空中滑翔，穿越大气，听起来非常宁静。

89
It is but they say that you should go with an instructor.
是的，但他们说您应该和教练一起去。

90
So what kind of instructor does this tour company offer?
那么这家旅游公司提供什么样的教练？

91
That's right.
没错。

92
The tour operator talked about taking you on a hang glider trip with one of experienced instructors.
旅游运营商提到带您与一位经验丰富的教练一起进行滑翔之旅。

93
So experienced is the keyword here.
所以经验丰富是这里的关键词。

94
You want someone who has done this many times before someone who knows what they are doing.
您想要一个之前做过很多次的人，知道自己在做什么。

95
That's right.
没错。

96
So an experienced instructor is a person that has as you say a lot of experience or is a professional.
所以经验丰富的教练是一个如您所说，拥有丰富经验或是专业人士的人。

97
So that's an experienced instructor.
所以这就是经验丰富的教练。

98
Right.
对。

99
You could even say, you know, I want to take flying lessons with an experienced pilot.
您甚至可以说，我想和一位经验丰富的飞行员一起上飞行课。

He is a very experienced chef.

103
He's been a chef for a long time.

所以滑翔伞和我们的最后一项运动也非常刺激。

106
We are going dog sledding.
我们要去狗拉雪橇。

107
Okay.
好的。

108

所以这基本上是一项冬季运动，或者是在雪地上进行的运动。

109
You stand or sit on a sled and a team of dogs.
你站或坐在雪橇上，由一队狗拉着你。

110
So that means many dogs pull you across the snow.

111
That's right.
没错。

112
So you go on a sled which is basically usually made out of plastic or wood and this is to go on top of the snow.
所以你坐在一个通常由塑料或木头制成的雪橇上，这样可以在雪上行驶。

113
And as you say a team of dogs pull you.
正如你所说，一队狗拉着你。

114
I think you can see this in movies.
我想你可以在电影中看到这个。

115
This is kind of like the mode of transportation in places where there are no roads.
这就像在没有道路的地方的交通方式。

116
There are no other ways of getting places that you just get pulled by dogs.
没有其他方式到达的地方，你只能被狗拉着。

117
Like Alaska or the Arctic Circle somewhere very very far north.
比如阿拉斯加或北极圈，那里非常非常北。

Language takeaway.
语言要点。

149
This first adjective is something I am not a fan of.
第一个形容词是我不喜欢的。

150
Let me just say if you ever go rafting and you see rocks you want to avoid or you want to stay away from jagged rocks.
让我说，如果你去漂流，看到岩石时，你想要避免或远离尖锐的岩石。

151
That's right, so the adjective jagged refers to maybe sharp or they can cut you, right?
没错，所以形容词尖锐指的是可能会割伤你的东西，对吧？

152
That's right, so something that is jagged is not smooth.
没错，所以尖锐的东西是不光滑的。

153
It's the opposite of smooth.
它是光滑的反义词。

154
That's right, so maybe you've seen some rocks that are very pointy or that have things that can easily hurt you or cut you.
没错，所以也许你见过一些非常尖的岩石，或者有东西容易伤到你或割伤你的。

155
Those are jagged rocks.
那些就是尖锐的岩石。

156
Broken glass can have jagged edges and that means you want to avoid touching it because it can hurt you.
破碎的玻璃可能有尖锐的边缘，这意味着你想要避免触碰它，因为它可能会伤到你。

157
Exactly, so jagged is a way of describing something that's maybe sharp, pointy, or very dangerous that can cut you.
正是如此，所以尖锐是描述某些可能会割伤你的东西的方式。

158
And then moving on, when we were talking about the hot air balloon, this person very cleverly said that he doesn't want to go up in the air in a basket held by an oversized balloon.
然后继续，当我们谈论热气球时，这个人非常聪明地说他不想在一个由超大气球支撑的篮子里飞上天。

159
Okay, so he's exaggerating.

160
Like you said, he's being clever or silly.

161
He's just afraid of the balloon.

162
But basically he's saying an oversized balloon is a very, very, very big or unnaturally big balloon.
但基本上他在说超大气球是一个非常、非常、非常大或不自然的大气球。

163
Right, so bigger than normal.
对，所以比正常的更大。

164
So an oversized balloon would be a balloon that's bigger than normal.
所以超大气球就是比正常的大气球。

165
Or maybe I've seen an oversized... In the early 1990s, I remember a clothing trend.
或者也许我见过一个超大的……在1990年代初，我记得有一种服装潮流。

166
A lot of people like to wear oversized t-shirts.
很多人喜欢穿超大号的T恤。

167
That's right, so t-shirts that were way too big for you or maybe unnaturally big, those would be oversized t-shirts.
没错，所以那些对你来说太大或不自然的大T恤就是超大号的T恤。

168
Like XXXL.
像是XXXL。

169
Exactly.
正是如此。

170
Alright, and our final adjective when he was talking about hang gliding.
好吧，最后一个形容词是他在谈论滑翔伞时提到的。

171
He said that he's not ready to go up in the air strapped to a flimsy kite.
他说他还没准备好在一个脆弱的风筝上飞上天。

172
Okay, so the key word here is flimsy.
好吧，这里的关键词是脆弱。

173
We already talked about a kite.
我们已经谈过风筝。

174
It's something that flies in the air.
它是在空中飞的东西。

175
But something that's flimsy is not very stable or sturdy.
但脆弱的东西是不太稳定或坚固的。

176
That's right, so it doesn't seem like it's very solid.
没错，所以它看起来不太坚固。

177
So if you have a kite... So a normal airplane is very sturdy, but a paper airplane is very flimsy.
所以如果你有一个风筝……正常的飞机是非常坚固的，但纸飞机是非常脆弱的。

178
It's thin.
它很薄。

179
It moves around a lot.
它移动得很厉害。

180
You can't control it.

183
It doesn't really seem like it can stay up in the air for very long.
它似乎不能在空中停留很久。

184
And it definitely can't support someone's weight.
而且它绝对无法支撑一个人的重量。

185
That's right, so you can even have a flimsy chair.
没错，所以你甚至可以有一把脆弱的椅子。

186
Maybe the chair is a little bit loose or it doesn't seem like it's very strong.
也许椅子有点松，或者看起来不太强壮。
