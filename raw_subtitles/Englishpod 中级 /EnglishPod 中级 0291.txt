美国中餐并没有强烈的蒜味，也不像通常的中餐那样辣。

And they're not the same as the Chinese peppers and these spicy foods you get in China.
而且它们与中国的辣椒和这些在中国吃的辣食物不同。

267
That's right.
没错。

268
And actually there is one more dish that we didn't mention in the dialogue, actually, but is very famous all around the United States.
其实还有一道菜我们在对话中没有提到，但在美国非常有名。
