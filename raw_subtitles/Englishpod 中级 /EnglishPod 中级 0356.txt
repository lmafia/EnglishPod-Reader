Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.
大家好，欢迎来到EnglishPod。

My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

3
Hi, everyone.
嗨，大家好。

4
My name is Katherine.
我叫Katherine。

5
And today, Marco, we're talking about money.
今天，Marco，我们要谈论钱。

6
That's right.
没错。

7
We're going to take a look at another lesson about money, but this time we're going to learn a little bit more about coins in the United States.
我们将看看关于钱的另一课，但这次我们要多了解一下美国的硬币。

8
That's right.
没错。

9
Different coins, so different sizes and shapes, they have different names because they represent different amounts of money.
不同的硬币，大小和形状各异，它们有不同的名称，因为它们代表不同的金额。

10
So today we're going to learn the names of those coins, and we're also going to learn a little bit about British money.
所以今天我们要学习这些硬币的名称，同时也会了解一些英国的钱。

11
So let's check out the dialogue.
那么让我们来看看对话。

12
Help me organize these coins.
帮我整理这些硬币。

13
That's a lot of money.
这真是一大笔钱。

14
What'd you do?
你做了什么？

15
Break the piggy bank?
打破了储蓄罐？

16
Yeah, I'm going to go to the bank and change it for bills, but first I have to separate them into little piles.
是的，我要去银行把它换成纸币，但首先我得把它们分成小堆。

17
Okay.
好的。

18
I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies.
我会找出所有的四分之一和十分之一，而你来分类镍币和便士。

19
Great.
太好了。

20
Then we can add everything up and take it to the bank.
然后我们可以把所有的加起来，带到银行去。

21
I found some coins that are not from here.
我找到了一些不是这里的硬币。

22
Oh yeah, those are from my trip to London.
哦，是的，那些是我去伦敦旅行时的。

23
I have like 90 pence, but in all it won't add up to one pound.
我有大约90便士，但总的来说加起来不会超过一英镑。

24
Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you?
你确定银行会给你换这些硬币吗？

25
Hopefully.
希望如此。

26
All right, we're back.
好吧，我们回来了。

27
So let's take a look at some of this language on Language Takeaway.
那么让我们看看Language Takeaway中的一些语言。

28
Language Takeaway.
Language Takeaway。

29
So first up, Marco, we have this funny phrase, break the piggy bank.
首先，Marco，我们有这个有趣的短语，打破储蓄罐。

30
What is a piggy bank?
什么是储蓄罐？

31
That's right.
没错。

32
A piggy bank.
储蓄罐。

33
Now you may have seen this.
你可能见过这个。

34
It has the shape of a little pig.
它的形状像一只小猪。

35
It's usually made out of plastic or ceramic, and it has a little hole at the top where you can put in coins and just basically save your money there.
通常是用塑料或陶瓷制成的，顶部有一个小孔，可以放入硬币，基本上就是在那儿存钱。

36
All right, so this is a pig-shaped bank, but it's a bank you keep in your room.
好吧，这是一种猪形的储蓄罐，但它是你放在房间里的银行。

37
Mostly children have these, right?
大多数孩子都有这些，对吧？

38
Yeah, so if you want to save your change or you want to save some of your coins that you have or teach your children about saving money, then usually they have a little piggy bank where they can store their money.
是的，所以如果你想存零钱或想存一些硬币，或者教孩子们存钱，通常他们会有一个小储蓄罐来存钱。

39
So when you break the piggy bank, usually these were made of ceramic.
所以当你打破储蓄罐时，通常这些是用陶瓷制成的。

40
So to spend the money, you have to decide when it's very, very special or important.
所以要花钱，你必须决定什么时候是非常特别或重要的。

41
So you have to break the entire bank.
所以你必须打破整个储蓄罐。

42
And that's when you take all the coins you've been saving.
那时你会拿出你一直在存的硬币。

43
Exactly, because they didn't really have a little hole where you could take it out from.
正是因为它们没有一个小孔可以取出来。

44
So when you wanted to take your money out, you literally had to break it.
所以当你想取出钱时，你真的必须打破它。

45
Break it.
打破它。

46
All right, so that's the piggy bank.
好吧，这就是储蓄罐。

47
But what do we store inside a piggy bank?
但我们在储蓄罐里存什么呢？

48
We don't store bills, do we?
我们不存纸币，对吧？

49
That's right.
没错。

50
No, we store coins.
不，我们存硬币。

51
So this is an interesting word, bill.
这是一个有趣的词，纸币。

52
You know, like the name bill, Bill Clinton, for example.
你知道，比如名字Bill，Bill Clinton。

53
Bills are the paper money that we use.
纸币是我们使用的纸币。

54
All right, but not capitalized like a name because this is a normal, common noun.
好吧，但不是像名字那样大写，因为这是一个普通的名词。

55
Bills represent all paper money.
纸币代表所有纸币。

56
So I could ask for change.
所以我可以要求找零。

57
Could I have the change in bills, please?
请问我可以用纸币找零吗？

58
That's right.
没错。

59
And if I'm at a store, they'll give me bills, maybe a $5 bill, $10 bill.
如果我在商店，他们会给我纸币，可能是5美元纸币，10美元纸币。

60
This also counts for other currencies.
这也适用于其他货币。

61
So if I'm in China, I might get my renminbi, my yuan in bills.
所以如果我在中国，我可能会得到我的人民币，纸币。

62
So it's just a general name for paper money.
所以这只是纸币的一个通用名称。

63
That's right.
没错。

64
But what we store in the piggy bank are coins.
但我们在储蓄罐里存的是硬币。

65
Now talking specifically about the types of coins or the different amounts that these represent, let's take a look at those more in detail.
现在具体谈谈这些硬币的类型或它们代表的不同金额，让我们更详细地看看这些。

66
All right, so first up, we've got quarters.
好吧，首先，我们有四分之一。

67
Now this should be pretty easy if you know your time, because a quarter is one-fourth of something.
这应该很简单，如果你知道时间，因为四分之一是某物的四分之一。

68
So if we're talking about money, it's a quarter of a dollar or 25 cents.
所以如果我们谈论钱，那就是一美元的四分之一或25美分。

69
That's right.
没错。

70
So 25 cents or a quarter of a dollar or one-fourth of a dollar, we just call it a quarter.
所以25美分或一美元的四分之一或一美元的四分之一，我们就叫它四分之一。

71
So, you know, most machines or pay phones, you need to insert quarters.
所以，你知道，大多数机器或公用电话，你需要插入四分之一。

72
That's right.
没错。

73
So you can recognize the quarter because it's the biggest coin, and it has a big eagle on one side.
所以你可以识别四分之一，因为它是最大的硬币，一面有一只大鹰。

74
And on the other side, it has George Washington's head.
另一面是乔治·华盛顿的头像。

75
George Washington, that's right.
乔治·华盛顿，没错。

76
Now the next in line or the next coin that we're going to take a look at are dimes.
现在下一个要看的硬币是十分之一。

77
Dimes.
十分之一。

78
Now these are also recognizable because they're the smallest coins, but that does not mean they're the smallest amount.
这些也很容易识别，因为它们是最小的硬币，但这并不意味着它们是最小的金额。

79
Dimes are actually the second largest.
十分之一实际上是第二大。

80
They're 10 cents.
它们是10美分。

81
They're 10 cents or one-tenth of a dollar.
它们是10美分或一美元的十分之一。

82
And so you can say they're 10 cents or you can say dime.
所以你可以说它们是10美分，或者你可以说是十分之一。

83
So do you have, I don't know, if you have 10 dimes, that means you got a dollar.
所以如果你有10个十分之一，那就意味着你有一美元。

84
That's right.
没错。

85
10 dimes equal one dollar.
10个十分之一等于一美元。

86
And the face on the dime is Alexander Hamilton.
而十分之一上的头像是亚历山大·汉密尔顿。

87
I don't know.
我不知道。

88
No, he was the first, well, he created basically the Department of the Treasury, but Thomas Jefferson is on another coin.
不，他是第一个，嗯，他基本上创建了财政部，但托马斯·杰斐逊在另一种硬币上。

89
And that's what we're going to look at next.
这就是我们接下来要看的。

90
That's right.
没错。

91
The nickel.
镍币。

92
The nickel is like the metal, you know, nickel.
镍币就像金属，知道吗，镍。

93
And yeah, so this one is a little bit bigger than the dime, but not as big as the quarter.
是的，所以这个比十分之一稍大，但不如四分之一大。

94
I think it's a little bit thicker, maybe.
我觉得它稍微厚一点，也许。

95
It is thicker, but it's not as much money.
它确实更厚，但钱不如多。

96
A nickel is five cents.
一个镍币是5美分。

97
Five cents.
5美分。

98
So one-twentieth of a dollar.
所以是美元的二十分之一。

99
That's right.
没错。

100
One-twentieth of a dollar.
美元的二十分之一。

101
So this is what we call a nickel.
所以这就是我们所称的镍币。

102
So you would call this coin.
所以你会称这个硬币。

103
You would say, hey, do you have any nickels?
你会说，嘿，你有镍币吗？

104
Dimes and nickels usually go together.
一角和镍币通常是一起的。

105
I don't know why.
我不知道为什么。

106
Nickels and dimes.
镍币和一角。

107
Nickels and dimes.
镍币和一角。

108
He's counting his nickels and dimes means he doesn't have very much money.
他在数他的镍币和一角，意味着他没有很多钱。

109
That's right.
没错。

110
So yeah, and then on this coin, you have the face of Thomas Jefferson.
所以是的，在这个硬币上，你有托马斯·杰斐逊的头像。

111
That's right.
没错。

112
Okay.
好的。

113
And finally, we have the only coin that's not silver colored.
最后，我们有唯一一个不是银色的硬币。

114
It's actually more of a copper color.
它实际上更像是铜色。

115
That would be the penny.
那就是便士。

116
The penny.
便士。

117
That's right.
没错。

118
One cent or one penny is the smallest of the coins.
一美分或一便士是最小的硬币。

119
And actually you need 100 of these to make one dollar.
实际上，你需要100个才能凑成一美元。

120
That's right.
没错。

121
So this is very unique because it's a different color.
所以这很独特，因为它是不同的颜色。

122
It's the smallest amount.
它是最小的金额。

123
And the face on this coin, do you know this one?
这个硬币上的头像，你知道这个吗？

124
Yes.
是的。

125
This one is Abraham Lincoln.
这个是亚伯拉罕·林肯。

126
Correct.
正确。

127
All right.
好吧。

128
So we've got all these important people.
所以我们有这些重要的人物。

129
All of them were presidents, actually, except for Alexander Hamilton.
他们实际上都是总统，除了亚历山大·汉密尔顿。

130
That's right.
没错。

131
And actually I think Alexander Hamilton looks good.
实际上我觉得亚历山大·汉密尔顿看起来不错。

132
Better than the rest.
比其他人好。

133
I don't know why.
我不知道为什么。

134
He was a pretty handsome man.
他是个相当英俊的男人。

135
Actually, no, he was said to be very funny looking, I think.
实际上，不，他被说成是非常滑稽的，我想。

136
Yeah, yeah.
是的，是的。

137
So actually all of these coins, you can call them by these names and everyone will recognize them, especially in the US.
所以实际上所有这些硬币，你可以用这些名字称呼它们，大家都会认出它们，尤其是在美国。

138
Now, I don't really think they apply to any other country, as we saw later on, for example, money in England or the United Kingdom.
现在，我不认为它们适用于其他国家，正如我们稍后看到的，例如，英格兰或英国的钱。

139
But usually in the US, if you say, hey, do you have any spare change or do you have any nickels and dimes?
但通常在美国，如果你说，嘿，你有零钱吗，或者你有镍币和一角吗？

140
Or can I borrow a penny?
或者我可以借一便士吗？

141
Can I borrow a penny?
我可以借一便士吗？

142
Actually, in the US, they have these little things called take a penny, leave a penny, right?
实际上，在美国，他们有这些小东西叫做“拿一便士，留一便士”，对吧？

143
Or give a penny, take a penny.
或者“给一便士，拿一便士”。

144
Yeah, you see these because pennies are not worth very much money.
是的，你会看到这些，因为便士不值很多钱。

145
And oftentimes, people will leave a penny.
而且很多时候，人们会留下一个便士。

146
And if you have, it may something costs 26 cents, but you only have a quarter, you can take a penny and then spend that.
如果你有，可能某样东西要26美分，但你只有一个四分之一，你可以拿一个便士然后花掉。

147
So they're basically free pennies you might see in a store.
所以它们基本上是你可能在商店看到的免费便士。

148
And then also, if you get change, maybe you don't want to carry those pennies around that change.
然后，如果你得到零钱，也许你不想携带那些便士。

149
So you just leave that there.
所以你就把它留在那里。

150
And then you know, it's kind of a way of recycling this small amount of money, which is very interesting.
然后你知道，这是一种回收这小额钱的方式，这很有趣。

151
It is very interesting.
这确实很有趣。

152
But we're going to actually take a look at some British currency.
但我们实际上要看看一些英国货币。

153
So let's take another listen to the dialogue.
所以让我们再听一遍对话。

154
And when we come back, we'll explore that.
当我们回来时，我们将探索这个。

155

161
Okay, I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies.
好的，我会找出所有的四分之一和一角，而你整理镍币和便士。

162

163
I found some coins that are not from here.
我找到了一些不是这里的硬币。

164
Oh, yeah, those are from my trip to London.
哦，是的，那些是我去伦敦时的。

165
I have like 90 pence, but it all won't add up to one pound.
我有大约90便士，但加起来不够一英镑。

166
Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you?
你确定银行会为你兑换这些硬币吗？

167
Hopefully.
希望如此。

168
All right, we're back.
好吧，我们回来了。

169
So let's take a look at these British words on language takeaway part two.
所以让我们看看这些英国词汇在语言外卖第二部分。

170
So here we've got British currency, the pound, right, is the name of the currency.
所以这里我们有英国货币，英镑，对吧，是货币的名称。

171
So in America, we have the dollar.
所以在美国，我们有美元。

172
In Britain, we have the pound.
在英国，我们有英镑。

173
Is it the sterling pound?
是不是叫做英镑？

174
Yeah, pound sterling.
是的，英镑。

175
The pound sterling.
英镑。

176
Pound sterling, and I think that has to do with weight, I'm sure.
英镑，我想这与重量有关，我确定。

177
But here we've got it divided into small and large quantities.
但这里我们把它分成小和大数量。

178
So where we have coins, we might have pence.
所以我们有硬币，可能有便士。

179
Sounds like cents.
听起来像美分。

180
Right, exactly.
对，正是。

181
And I think actually the penny might come from the British term pence.
我认为实际上便士可能来自英国术语便士。

182
I'm sure it does.
我确定是的。

183
They're very similar, and the meaning is basically one hundredth of a pound.
它们非常相似，意思基本上是英镑的百分之一。

184
Right, exactly.
对，正是。

185
And the pound is basically what you would say in the US.
而英镑基本上就是你在美国会说的。

186
A dollar, a pound is the currency of England.
一美元，英镑是英格兰的货币。

187
But actually, you know how in the United States, people would say, you know, a hundred bucks?
但实际上，你知道在美国，人们会说，你知道，一百块？

188
Yeah.
是的。

189
Which would be a hundred dollars.
这就是一百美元。

190
Over there, they say one hundred quid.
在那里，他们说一百英镑。

191
Quid.
英镑。

192
So yeah, this is actually important slang.
所以是的，这实际上是重要的俚语。

193
In America, I would spend five bucks.
在美国，我会花五块钱。

194
At the movies in Britain, I would spend five quid.
在英国的电影院，我会花五英镑。

195
And now that's a slang term for one pound.
这就是一英镑的俚语。

196
That's right.
没错。

197
And actually, I've heard also like 50p, which I think means 50 cents.
其实，我还听说过50便士，我认为这意味着50美分。

198
Yeah, pence.
是的，便士。

199
Yeah, so 50p.
是的，所以50便士。

200
So you could say this stick of this pack of gum costs 50p.
所以你可以说这包口香糖的价格是50便士。

201
So 50 pence.
所以50便士。

202
That's right.
没错。

203
Half of a pound.
半个英镑。

204
So as you can see, obviously the currencies are different, but also it is interesting to learn the way that you would say it locally.
所以如你所见，货币显然是不同的，但了解当地的说法也很有趣。

205
So, you know, next time if you are in Britain or you're talking to an English person, then you'd know if they say, you know, 50 quid, you understand they're talking about 50 pounds.
所以，下次如果你在英国或和一个英国人交谈时，如果他们说50英镑，你就知道他们在说50英镑。

206
So, but they don't use the euro over there.
但是他们那里不使用欧元。

207
No, they don't, not in Great Britain.
不，他们不在大不列颠使用。

208
They do use the euro on the continents of France, Italy.
他们在法国、意大利的大陆上使用欧元。

209
And the euro is the name of that currency.
欧元就是那种货币的名称。

210
Okay.
好的。

211
All right.
好吧。

212
So a lot of great stuff.
所以有很多很棒的东西。

213
And now lastly, although we saw it at the beginning of the dialogue, let's talk about what this person wants to do.
现在最后，虽然我们在对话开始时看到过，让我们谈谈这个人想做什么。

214
He wants to change these coins into bills.
他想把这些硬币换成纸币。

215
That's right.
没错。

216
So the verb when you need to exchange money is to change money.
所以当你需要兑换货币时，动词是换钱。

217
So let's say if I go to England and all I have is dollars, I would say I want to change money.
所以假设我去英国，只有美元，我会说我想换钱。

218
Okay.
好的。

219
You could also say exchange, but when we're speaking to one another, we normally just say change.
你也可以说兑换，但当我们彼此交谈时，我们通常只说换。

220
Right.
对。

221
Because even the places are sometimes called like money changers.
因为有时地方也被称为换钱处。

222
You know, they say that or something like that.
你知道，他们会这样说。

223
Exactly.
正是如此。

224
And so if I want to change money, that means I want to maybe change dollars for Euros or dollars for pounds.
所以如果我想换钱，那意味着我可能想把美元换成欧元或英镑。

225
But this also can mean I want to change a dollar for some quarters.
但这也可以意味着我想把一美元换成一些四分之一美元。

226
Right, right.
对，对。

227
Because I need quarters for like a laundry machine or a telephone.
因为我需要四分之一美元来使用洗衣机或电话。

228
And I've heard also the term is to break.
我还听说过一个术语是“找零”。

229
So if maybe you have a $10 bill and you need maybe a $5 bill, but you don't have one, you ask the person to break that money.
所以如果你有一张10美元的钞票，但你需要一张5美元的钞票，但你没有，你可以问那个人找零。

230
So you say, can you break this bill?
所以你可以说，你能帮我找零吗？

231
Yeah, and that actually makes sense because a bill, normally you break something that's big into smaller pieces.
是的，这实际上是有道理的，因为钞票，通常你会把大的东西分成小块。

232
So if you think about it, if I break a glass, it becomes many pieces.
所以如果你想想，如果我打破一个玻璃，它会变成很多碎片。

233
Well, if I break a $5 bill, I want maybe $1, I get five of those, there's one piece and then it breaks into many pieces.
如果我打破一张5美元的钞票，我想要1美元，我得到五张，那就是一块，然后它分成很多块。

234
So to break means to ask for smaller change.
所以找零意味着请求更小的零钱。

235
That's right.
没错。

236
So maybe next time you guys need change, you can go up to someone and say, excuse me, can you change this $5 bill for me?
所以下次你们需要零钱时，可以走到某人面前说，打扰一下，你能把这张5美元的钞票换成零钱吗？

237
Or can you break this $5 bill?
或者你能帮我找零这张5美元的钞票吗？

238
That's right.
没错。

239
All right.
好吧。

240
So a lot of interesting language, very useful stuff.
所以有很多有趣的语言，非常有用的东西。

241
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time.
让我们最后再听一次对话。

242
Help me organize these coins.
帮我整理这些硬币。

243
That's a lot of money.
这很多钱。

244
What'd you do break the piggy bank?

245
Yeah, I'm gonna go to the bank and change it for bills.
是的，我要去银行把它换成纸币。

246
But first I have to separate them into little piles.
但我首先得把它们分成小堆。

247
Okay, I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies.
好的，我会找出所有的四分之一和十分，而你整理镍币和便士。

248
Great.
太好了。

249
Then we can add everything up and take it to the bank.
然后我们可以把所有的加起来，带到银行去。

250
I found some coins that are not from here.
我找到了些不是这里的硬币。

251
Oh yeah, those are from my trip to London.

255
All right, coming back to the topic.
好吧，回到主题。

256
Now, you seem to know a lot about this stuff.
现在，你似乎对这些东西了解很多。

257
Let's test your knowledge here.
