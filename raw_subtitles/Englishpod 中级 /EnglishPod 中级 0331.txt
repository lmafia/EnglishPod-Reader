So Melissa says, hey Michelle, jump in quick.

63
We can just say it's pouring.

64
That's right.
没错。

65
As you can see in that sentence, Melissa doesn't say at any time it's raining.
正如你在那句话中看到的，Melissa没有在任何时候说“在下雨”。

66

95
So I'm going to say something that might or might not be true.
所以我将说一些可能是真的，也可能不是真的事情。

96
That's right.

Let's get started with the first phrase when she says that they got married on holiday.

然后继续，她说，他们也想结婚。

156
Michelle did, but they had to postpone their wedding.

So you maybe want to do it today, but it's raining today.
所以你可能想今天做，但今天下雨。

159
So you have to postpone until next week.

160
That's right.

162
Yeah, that's right.
是的，没错。

163
So you could say that because of bad weather, the picnic will be postponed until next month.

164
So that's the way they use postpone.
这就是他们使用“推迟”的方式。

165
Now, it's interesting because you have a P in between there, so it's postpone.
现在，这很有趣，因为你中间有一个P，所以是推迟。

166
Postpone.

167
Yeah, it's an interesting word to pronounce.
是的，这是一个有趣的发音词。

168
And well, they also had to postpone it because of money.

169
You know, it's just very expensive.

170
And Melissa agrees by saying, I know what you mean.

171
I know what you mean.
我知道你的意思。

172
Now, this is a really common phrase, and this is something you'll hear with more relaxed conversations between friends.
现在，这是一个非常常见的短语，这是你在朋友之间更轻松的对话中会听到的。

173
It means I understand the situation or I feel the same way.
这意味着我理解这个情况，或者我有同样的感觉。

That's right.

180
You also agree, I know what you mean.

181
It's just a way of agreeing with someone.

182
Alright, and then she goes on to confirm what Michelle is saying by saying, I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive.
好吧，然后她继续确认米歇尔所说的，表示我觉得上海越来越贵。

183
Alright, this is a really, really key sentence structure here.
好吧，这里是一个非常关键的句子结构。

184
We have more and more, more and more, and then after that we have an adjective.
我们有越来越多，越来越多，然后在后面有一个形容词。

185
So the structure is more and more adjectives.
所以结构是越来越多的形容词。

186
So more and more spicy, more and more funny, more and more expensive.
所以越来越多的辣，越来越多的有趣，越来越多的贵。

187
So in this case, the city is more expensive than it was before.
所以在这种情况下，这个城市比以前更贵。

188
That's right.
没错。

189
And it's still getting more expensive.
而且它仍在变得越来越贵。

190
That's right.
没错。

191
That's the main idea when you use this structure is that when you say more and more, and then you add an adjective such as expensive or beautiful, it means that it continues to grow.
使用这个结构的主要思想是，当你说越来越多，然后添加一个形容词，比如贵或美丽时，这意味着它继续增长。

192
It continues to get more expensive or more beautiful or more difficult.
它继续变得越来越贵或越来越美丽或越来越困难。

193
But remember that we are using adjectives here that are, when you're using the comparative, you can't say, for example, you can't use funny.
但请记住，当你使用比较级时，不能说，例如，你不能说越来越有趣。

194
You can't say you are getting more and more funny.
因为显然“有趣”的比较级是“更有趣”。

195
Because obviously the comparative for funny is funnier.

196
So just be careful with that one because it could be a little bit confusing.
所以要小心，因为这可能会有点混淆。

197
Alright, so to finish off our Fluency Builder, we have Michelle who agrees with Melissa and says, yeah, you know, I think Shanghai is getting more expensive.
好吧，为了结束我们的流利构建者，我们有米歇尔，她同意梅丽莎并说，是的，我认为上海变得越来越昂贵。

198
And she says, I sure do.
她说，我当然同意。

199
So she's basically agreeing.
所以她基本上是在同意。

200
She's saying yes, that's true.
她在说，是的，没错。

201
But why does she say I sure do?
但她为什么说我当然同意？

202
Why doesn't she say agree?
她为什么不说同意？

203
I agree or yeah, you're right.
我同意或者是的，你说得对。

204
Well, she doesn't have to say it because she says I do.
嗯，她不需要这样说，因为她说我同意。

205
The question before that was, I think something something, don't you?
之前的问题是，我认为某某，不是吗？

206
And she says, I do.
她说，我同意。

207
And I don't think that.
而我并不这样认为。

208
So it's assumed that she also thinks this.
所以可以假设她也这样认为。

209
She's answering a question.
她在回答一个问题。

210
That's right.
没错。

211
So it's an interesting way of asking a question when you say, I think this city is beautiful, don't you?
所以当你说，我认为这个城市很美丽，不是吗？这是一种有趣的提问方式。

212
So the proper way to answer that would be I do or I sure do.
所以正确的回答方式是我同意或者我当然同意。

213
Alright, so that's all the time we have for Fluency Builder.
