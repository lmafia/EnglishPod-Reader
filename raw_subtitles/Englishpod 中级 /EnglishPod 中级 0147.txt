50
It's not very nice.

51
Well, I mean, between guys you would use it as like, oh, this chick or that chick, but you wouldn't really walk up to a girl and call her a chick, right?
嗯，我是说，在男孩之间你可以用，比如说，这个女孩或那个女孩，但你不会真的走到一个女孩面前叫她chick，对吧？

No, you wouldn't say, hey, chick, what's up?
不，你不会说，嘿，女孩，怎么样？

53
That's not something you want to say.

So chick is a slang word for a girl or a woman.

So, hey, Marco, what flicks are showing at the movie theater?
所以，嘿，Marco，电影院上映了什么电影？

60
Alright, so movies.
好吧，电影。

80
Alright, so it's not really what you're saying, it's kind of how you're saying it.

205
And the same thing with the girls, right?
女孩也是一样，对吧？

Because a guy's friends maybe drink too much, play too many card games, single... So I think a lot of times these problems also have to do with the fact that, like, when a girl is with her girlfriend, she maybe acts differently.
因为一个男孩的朋友可能喝得太多，玩太多纸牌游戏，单身……所以我认为很多时候这些问题也与这样的事实有关：当一个女孩和她的女朋友在一起时，她可能表现得不同。
