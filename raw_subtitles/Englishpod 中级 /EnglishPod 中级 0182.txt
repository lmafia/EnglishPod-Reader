64
Right now, why don't we take a look at four key words in language takeaway.

65
Okay, these first two words are words that the wife uses in talking about some of these clothes that she got as presents.

70
This big light.

71
Now, flashy when you're talking about clothes or an object, it's too noticeable, right?
现在，当你谈论衣服或物体时，花哨是指太显眼，对吧？

72
It's too noticeable, too bright, too loud.
太显眼，太亮，太吵。

73
So for example, a black shirt is not flashy.
例如，一件黑色衬衫就不花哨。

74
But an orange shirt... An orange shirt with buttons and bells and rhinestones, diamonds, that's flashy.
但一件橙色衬衫……一件带钮扣、铃铛和水晶、钻石的橙色衬衫，那就是花哨。

75
Flashy can also mean something that is supposed to look expensive.
花哨也可以指看起来很贵的东西。

76
Okay, so that sweater was a little bit flashy according to her.
好的，所以那件毛衣在她看来有点花哨。

77
But also she talked about another sweater being hideous.
但她还提到另一件毛衣很丑。

78
So hideous is an ugly word and it means ugly.
所以“丑”是一个丑陋的词，意思是丑。

79
Okay, so I could say this sweater is hideous.
好的，我可以说这件毛衣很丑。

80
That means it's not only ugly, it's really ugly.
这意味着它不仅丑，而且真的很丑。

81
Okay, it's more than ugly.

82
Alright, a hideous sweater.

83
And moving on, the guy now was a little bit irritated and stressed out and he said, you keep yapping on about your new clothes.
然后，那个男的有点恼火和紧张，他说，你一直在唠叨你的新衣服。

84
So what is this yapping on?
那么“唠叨”是什么意思？

85
Well, yap is a sound like yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap.
嗯，唠叨是像“唠叨，唠叨，唠叨，唠叨，唠叨”的声音。

86
Right.
对。

87
So yapping, to yap on about means to continue to talk and talk and talk about something.
所以“唠叨”意味着继续谈论某事。

88
Okay.
好的。

89

98
To blabber, to blabber on about means to talk about something but to not really make sense.
“喋喋不休”意味着谈论某事，但并不真正有意义。

好的。

100
So it's just worthless talk.

So you're just talking to talk.
所以你只是为了说话而说话。

102
You're not really saying anything interesting.
你并没有说什么有趣的事情。

103
Exactly.
正是如此。

104
And so sometimes we make fun of people who blabber on about things because they're not important to us or they sound stupid.
有时我们会嘲笑那些喋喋不休的人，因为他们对我们来说并不重要，或者听起来很愚蠢。

105
Alright.
好吧。

106
Okay, so four key words there.
好的，所以这里有四个关键词。

107
Blabbering on, yapping on.

135
Okay, so this first phrase is very closely related to the days after Christmas, especially here on Boxing Day.

136
We've got someone who's talking about going to the stores, to the sales, to exchange her gifts for better gifts.

138
This is a very common construction, it's an important phrase when talking about shopping.
这是一个非常常见的结构，在谈论购物时是一个重要的短语。

139
So when we look at this construction you would say, to exchange this sweater for a better one, or for a larger one.
所以当我们看到这个结构时，你可以说，交换这件毛衣换一件更好的，或者换一件更大的。

140
Exactly, so you can change the adjective, the word that's describing it, so you can say, to exchange these shoes for bigger ones.
正是如此，所以你可以改变形容词，描述它的词，所以你可以说，交换这些鞋子换更大的。

141
I could also joke and I could say, I'm going to exchange my boyfriend for a better one, if he's being rude to me.
我也可以开玩笑说，如果我的男朋友对我无礼，我要换一个更好的。

142
Okay, so to exchange something for something else.
好的，所以交换某物以换取其他东西。

143
Alright, and then we saw another phrase that the husband replied to when she offended him with his football team.
好的，然后我们看到另一个短语，丈夫在她冒犯他足球队时的回应。

144
He said, oh no you didn't.
他说，哦，你可别这样。

145
Didn't what?
没什么？

146
I know, didn't what, no you didn't what.

147
Alright, so this, like you said, doesn't make sense alone, but some cultural context might help.
好吧，正如你所说，这单独并没有意义，但一些文化背景可能会有所帮助。

148
In English we often say this phrase to mean, oh no you didn't just say that.
在英语中，我们常常说这个短语来表示，哦，你可别说那样。

154
Oh, no you didn't.
哦，你可别这样。

155
I did just say, I don't think so actually.
我确实说了，我其实并不这样认为。

156
It's usually a response, right?

157
You have to wait until somebody maybe says something mean, or something that really hurts your feelings, or you don't agree with when you respond to this, but you're usually very, very offended, right?
你得等到有人说了什么刻薄的话，或者真的伤害了你的感情，或者你不同意的时候再回应，但你通常会非常生气，对吧？

158
Exactly, it's always a response to a comment that has made you angry or upset.
正是如此，这总是对让你生气或不安的评论的回应。

159
Okay, and our last phrase is, when they finished talking and they were fighting, she left and said, I might just.
好的，我们最后一个短语是，当他们结束谈话并争吵时，她离开并说，我可能会。

160
Just what?
就是什么？

161
I know, just what.
我知道，就是什么。

162
See, again, these are common phrases, but they don't seem to make much sense alone.
你看，这些都是常见的短语，但单独看似乎没有太大意义。

163
I might just.
我可能会。

164
So let's listen to, this is a response again, this is a response to the line before it.
所以让我们听听，这又是一个回应，这是对前一句的回应。

165
Why don't you just, just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until much later?
你为什么不去退掉那些愚蠢的衣服，等很久再回来？

166
And she says, I might just, I might just do exactly what you just said.

她在威胁他，她在说，我可能会出去，十个小时都不回来。

170
Okay, so that's a way to say, what you said, I might do that, and I'm threatening you.
好的，所以这是一种说法，你说的，我可能会这样做，我在威胁你。

171
So again, it's usually a response, right?
所以这通常是一个回应，对吧？

172
Or a threat, as you said.
或者是威胁，正如你所说。

173
So I can say, Marco, why don't you just leave?
所以我可以说，马尔科，你为什么不离开？

174
Alright, I might just.
好吧，我可能会。

175
Uh oh, what am I going to do in the studio alone?

176
