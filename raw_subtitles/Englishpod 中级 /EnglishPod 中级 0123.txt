这个词源于90年代，因为在那段时间，美国的邮递员有点疯狂，他们开始开枪和送一些奇怪的包裹。

308
He said, what's up?

So in the 90s, it was popular, instead of saying what's up, you would just kind of double BS and just say what's up.

Yeah, so you'll use it.

319
Actually, in SpanishPod, they have a show called Que Pasa, which is like the translation of what's up.
其实，在SpanishPod，他们有个节目叫Que Pasa，就像怎么了的翻译。

320
Oh, right.
哦，对。

321
They start each show with like, saying Que Pasa, but it's exactly the same.
他们每个节目都以Que Pasa开头，但完全一样。

322
So maybe it will become popular in Spanish.

Maybe, but I guess only...
也许，但我想只有...

Time will tell.
