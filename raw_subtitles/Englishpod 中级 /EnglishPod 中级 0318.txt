Alright, so now let's take a look at vocab on Language Takeaway.
好吧，现在让我们看看Language Takeaway的词汇。

44
Alright, so Marco, we have a number of things that might happen if you're feeling like you're allergic to something.
好吧，Marco，如果你感觉对某些东西过敏，可能会发生一些事情。

45
The first one is, my eyes are all watery.
第一个是，我的眼睛都流泪了。

46
Okay, so your eyes get watery, and that means you start to have a lot of water, a lot of tears in your eyes.
好吧，你的眼睛流泪了，这意味着你开始有很多水，很多泪水在眼睛里。

47
That's right, but you're not sad, you're not crying, it's just that you have this reaction that you cannot control, and the water maybe comes down from your eyes.
没错，但你并不伤心，也没有哭，只是你有这种无法控制的反应，水可能从你的眼睛流下来。

48
Right, usually your eyes get wet and watery, itchy, red, so a lot of that.
对，通常你的眼睛会湿润、流泪、发痒、发红，很多这样的情况。

49
There's another thing too, this happens a lot, you feel like you can't stop sneezing.
还有另一种情况，这种情况很常见，你感觉自己无法停止打喷嚏。

50
To sneeze.
打喷嚏。

51
A sneeze is something you do when the air comes out of your nose.
打喷嚏是指空气从你的鼻子里出来。

52
Out of your nose, out of your mouth, out of everywhere.
从你的鼻子、嘴巴，甚至是任何地方。

53
Yeah, and you can't control it, and sometimes it's very, very strong.
是的，你无法控制，有时非常强烈。

54
You move your head, but it's something that you do when you're allergic to something like a cat or a flower, but also maybe when you smell something, some spice like hot pepper.
你动动头，但这是你对像猫或花这样的东西过敏时会发生的事情，但也可能是当你闻到某种香料，比如辣椒时。

55
Yeah, or when you're sick, when you have a cold.
是的，或者当你生病时，感冒的时候。

56
That's right.
没错。

57
And so his friend says that maybe they should put him into quarantine.
他的朋友说也许他们应该把他隔离。

58
Alright, now this is a joke.
好吧，这只是个玩笑。

59
If you have allergies, you don't have to go to quarantine, but quarantine is very serious.
如果你有过敏，你不需要去隔离，但隔离是非常严肃的。

60
It's a place where people go when they have a dangerous or very infectious disease, and quarantine means that no one else can come in and you cannot go out.
这是人们在有危险或非常传染的疾病时去的地方，隔离意味着没有其他人可以进来，你也不能出去。

61
Right, exactly.
对，没错。

62
So I think when they had the pig flu, the swine flu, many people were put into quarantine to make sure they didn't give it to someone else.
所以我认为当他们有猪流感时，很多人被隔离以确保他们不会传染给其他人。

63
That's right.
没错。

64
So usually in quarantine you have to wait until you can prove that you're not sick anymore, and then you get to leave.
所以通常在隔离中，你必须等到你能证明自己不再生病，然后才能离开。

65
That's right.
没错。

66
Alright, so they were talking about maybe the options of what he is allergic to.
好吧，他们在讨论他可能对什么过敏的选项。

67
He says, I don't think I'm allergic to pollen, so what is pollen and where does it come from?
他说，我觉得我对花粉不敏感，那么花粉是什么，来自哪里？

68
Alright, now pollen is actually a very common allergy, and pollen comes from flowers.
好吧，花粉实际上是一种非常常见的过敏源，花粉来自花。

69
It's kind of like a special dust or a special kind of thing that you see on flowers that gets blown away.
它有点像一种特殊的灰尘或一种你在花上看到的特殊东西，会被吹走。

70
So when it's springtime, many people suffer from allergies because there's a lot more pollen in the air.
所以在春天，很多人因为空气中有更多的花粉而遭受过敏。

71
So it's that little dust, usually sometimes yellow, that you can find on flowers.
所以就是那种小灰尘，通常有时是黄色的，可以在花上找到。

72
And this is actually what butterflies and bees look for.
这实际上是蝴蝶和蜜蜂寻找的东西。

73
That's right.
没错。

74
And then he talked about, well, he's not allergic to bees, and his friend threw a peanut at him, but he said it in a very strange way.
然后他谈到，他对蜜蜂不过敏，他的朋友把一个花生扔给他，但他说得很奇怪。

75
He said, why did you Chuck that peanut at me?
他说，为什么你把那个花生扔给我？

76
To Chuck.
扔。

77
Now this is a very spoken English way of saying something.
这是一种非常口语化的英语表达。

78
To Chuck means to throw.
扔的意思是投掷。

79
So like, Marco, why did you Chuck that pillow at me?
所以，Marco，你为什么把那个枕头扔给我？

80
That was mean.
那太过分了。

81
Alright, so to Chuck is to throw, but usually to throw something strongly.
好吧，扔就是投掷，但通常是强烈地投掷某物。

82
So, as you said, it's very spoken English.
所以，正如你所说，这是一种非常口语化的英语。

83
It's not really proper to actually write it or say it to someone in a formal occasion.
在正式场合实际上不太适合写或对某人说。

84
Yeah, that's right.
是的，没错。

85
So you wouldn't say this in your English exam, but you could say this with your friends.
所以你不会在英语考试中说这个，但你可以在朋友之间说。

86
Okay, so to Chuck something.
好吧，扔某物。

87
So that's all the vocab we have for you.
所以这就是我们为你准备的所有词汇。

Now, what does it mean to go into shock?

128

For example, if you fall in very, very, very cold water, your body goes into shock.

And for our last phrase, when Jim was talking about maybe being allergic to pollen, or he said, I'm desensitized to bee stings.
在最后一个短语中，当吉姆谈论可能对花粉过敏时，或者他说，我对蜜蜂蜇的反应减弱了。

173
Alright, so desensitized, you should know automatically that prefix D means not.

174
Mm-hmm.
嗯哼。

175
D means that I'm not sensitive to, alright?

They're allergic to milk.
他们对牛奶过敏。

233

235
Someone who cannot drink milk or dairy products, like ice cream, is called lactose intolerant.
不能喝牛奶或乳制品（如冰淇淋）的人叫乳糖不耐症。

236
So, if you're lactose intolerant, it means that your stomach is very upset after you have dairy products.

242
Now gluten is a very common product that is found in breads and cereal, things like that.
面筋是一种常见的成分，存在于面包和谷物等食物中。

243
And so people who have an allergy to gluten actually have to change their diet quite a bit.
所以对面筋过敏的人实际上需要改变他们的饮食。

244
Yeah, they have to look for things that are gluten-free, which is very hard because apparently it's in everything.
是的，他们必须寻找无面筋的食物，这很难，因为显然它无处不在。

245
That's right.
没错。

246
So if you have one of these allergies, you can find dairy-free on the box or gluten-free on the box.
所以如果你有这些过敏，你可以在包装上找到无乳制品或无面筋的标签。

247
And specialty food stores will have these labels.

248
And so are you allergic to anything?

And I'm very lucky, I think, because I can't imagine if I had an allergy to peanuts or to seafood.

257
Which not only would be a shame because you can't have these foods, but if you accidentally have it, it could be life-threatening.
这不仅会很可惜，因为你不能吃这些食物，而且如果你不小心吃了，可能会危及生命。

258
That's right.
没错。

259
Like my dad, who is allergic to bees, would go into anaphylactic shock if he were stung.
就像我爸爸，他对蜜蜂过敏，如果被蜇了会进入过敏性休克。

260
And so you have to be very careful because you never know when you'll have an accident like that.
所以你必须非常小心，因为你永远不知道什么时候会发生这样的意外。

261
Exactly.
正是如此。

262
So this is an interesting topic.
