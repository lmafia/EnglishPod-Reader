Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another lesson here at EnglishPod.
大家好，欢迎回到EnglishPod的另一节课。

2
My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

3
And my name is Kathryn.
我叫Kathryn。

4
So, Marco, what are we talking about today?
Marco，今天我们要谈什么？

5
Today we're talking about a very interesting topic.
今天我们要讨论一个非常有趣的话题。

6
You've probably seen it on every TV show or American movie.
你可能在每个电视节目或美国电影中都见过它。

7
And it's a bachelor party.
那就是单身派对。

8
Uh-oh.
哦哦。

9
Yeah.
是的。

10
I've heard bad things.
我听说过一些坏事。

11
Bad things about a bachelor party.
关于单身派对的坏事。

12
Well, they can be fun, but at times they can be a little bit too excessive, too much.
嗯，它们可以很有趣，但有时也会有点过火，太多了。

13
But before we get started on the dialogue, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.
但在我们开始对话之前，为什么不先看看词汇预览呢？

14
Well, the first one we've got here is the topic of today.
好的，今天的第一个话题就是单身派对。

15
This is the bachelor party.
那么，单身汉到底是什么？

16
So what is a bachelor exactly?
对。

17
Right.

18
Well, a bachelor is a person who is not married.
单身汉是一个未婚的人。

19
A single person.
一个单身的人。

20
A single guy, specifically.
特别是一个单身男士。

21
Alright.
好的。

22
So it's a man.
所以是一个男人。

23
Man.
男人。

24
Before he's married.
在他结婚之前。

25
Right.
对。

26
So for women, you would say a bachelorette.
对于女性，你可以说是单身女。

27
Okay.
好的。

28
Bachelor is a guy and a bachelorette is a girl.
单身汉是男生，单身女是女生。

29
And so we don't really say bachelorette except when we're talking about this party.
所以我们不太会说单身女，除非是在谈论这个派对。

30
Right.
对。

31
So a bachelor party is a party that a guy has the day before he's married or maybe two or three days before he actually gets married.
所以单身派对是一个男生在结婚前一天或两三天前举办的派对。

32
So it's a night where all his friends get together, they go out, they have some drinks, they have some fun, and just like the last extreme fun they will have, he will have before he gets married.
所以这是一个晚上，所有他的朋友聚在一起，出去喝酒，玩得开心，就像是他结婚前最后的极限乐趣。

33
Alright.
好的。

34
And so it's all his guy friends.
所以都是他的男性朋友。

35
All his guy friends.
所有的男性朋友。

36
Only guys, no girls.
只有男生，没有女生。

37
And the bachelorette party is only girls and it's when a girl's friends take her out before she gets married to celebrate her last night or two of being unmarried.
而单身女派对只有女生，是女生的朋友在她结婚前带她出去庆祝她最后一两晚的单身生活。

38
Right.
对。

39
Exactly.
正是如此。

40
So not only guys parties can get a little bit crazy, but girls, bachelorette parties can also get kind of crazy, right?
所以不仅男生的派对可能会有点疯狂，女生的单身女派对也可能会有点疯狂，对吧？

41
That's true.
这是真的。

42
So before we start talking about what exactly goes on at some of these parties, let's take a listen to today's dialogue and hear what happens to our main characters.
在我们开始讨论这些派对上到底发生了什么之前，先听听今天的对话，看看我们的主角发生了什么。

They're a great couple.
他们是一对很棒的情侣。

48

Anyways, I just talked to Alex's best man and he is organizing the bachelor party.
不管怎样，我刚和Alex的伴郎谈过，他正在组织单身派对。

50
It's gonna be so much fun!
这会非常有趣！

52
You aren't going to a strip club, are you?
你不会去脱衣舞俱乐部吧？

53
I don't want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it's your friend's party.
我不想你借着朋友的派对去找脱衣舞女郎。

61
If one of your friends was getting married, I wouldn't mind you going to her bachelorette party.
如果你朋友要结婚，我不会介意你去她的单身女派对。

好的，因为我的朋友Wendy要结婚，我正在组织她的派对。

63
What?!
什么？！

64
All right, great.
好吧，太好了。

65
So apparently both of them have parties to go to, but I don't think the guy was too happy about it.
所以显然他们两个都有派对要参加，但我觉得那个男生并不太高兴。

66
I don't think so either, and that's the funny thing.
我也不觉得，搞笑的就是这个。

67
I think a lot of girls are like, oh, well, my husband-to-be, he wants to have a party, it's okay.
我觉得很多女孩会想，哦，我的未婚夫想要举办派对，没问题。

68
But the minute the girl wants to have the party, the guy is like, uh-uh, no way.
但当女孩想要举办派对时，男生就会说，不行。

69
That's true, I guess.
我想这是真的。

70
But we can talk a little bit more about this towards the end.
但我们可以在最后再多谈谈这个。

71
Before we start on this really interesting topic, why don't we take a look at some of the language on Language Takeaway.
在我们开始这个非常有趣的话题之前，为什么不先看看一些语言要点呢？

72
Well, Marco, the first few words are actually more wedding terms than bachelor party terms.
好吧，Marco，前几个词实际上是婚礼术语，而不是单身派对术语。

73
The first one is best man.
第一个是伴郎。

74
Right, the best man.
对，伴郎。

75
So the best man is... who is he exactly?
那么伴郎到底是谁？

76
He's usually the groom's best friend.
他通常是新郎的最好朋友。

77
So the groom is the man getting married, and his best friend has the position of best man.
所以新郎是要结婚的男人，他的最好朋友担任伴郎。

78
So he has some special things to do at the wedding.
所以他在婚礼上有一些特别的事情要做。

79
He has to make a speech, for example, and he has to stand next to his friend when the friend gets married.
比如说，他必须发表演讲，并且在朋友结婚时站在他旁边。

80
Right.
对。

81
And it's just a very special position of honor that the best friend has in his friend's wedding.
这只是伴郎在朋友婚礼上非常特殊的荣誉地位。

82
Okay, and among those responsibilities, the best man is usually the one that has to organize the bachelor party, right?
好的，在这些责任中，伴郎通常是负责组织单身派对的人，对吧？

83
Exactly.
正是如此。

84
Okay, so best man.
好的，所以伴郎。

85
And, well, the rest of the groom's friends are also present at the wedding, and they are called the groomsmen.
而且，新郎的其他朋友也会出席婚礼，他们被称为伴郎。

86
Alright, so groom, groomsmen.
好的，所以新郎，伴郎。

87
And so usually these are maybe three to five guys, three to five men, who are friends of the groom or brother of the bride.
通常这些可能是三到五个男生，都是新郎的朋友或新娘的兄弟。

88
It depends on the wedding.
这取决于婚礼。

89
And they stand with the man when he gets married, and so they kind of have a lot of responsibilities as well.
他们在新郎结婚时站在他身边，所以他们也有很多责任。

90
Okay, and the groomsmen usually are also present at the bachelor party.
好的，伴郎通常也会出席单身派对。

91
Exactly.

92
Alright, now moving on to a bit more colorful language, we have a place here, a strip club.
好的，现在我们来谈谈更生动的语言，这里有一个地方，脱衣舞俱乐部。

93
Okay, so sometimes you see these in movies oftentimes, or for example the TV show The Sopranos.
好的，有时你在电影中经常看到这些，或者例如电视剧《黑道家族》。

94
This is often a place where Tony Soprano goes.
这是Tony Soprano经常去的地方。

95
A strip club is a club, it's like a bar, it's open most of the day and night, where there are women who take their clothes off for money.
脱衣舞俱乐部是一个俱乐部，就像酒吧，白天和晚上大部分时间开放，那里有女人为钱脱衣服。

96
Alright, so you have the verb to strip, right?
好的，所以你有动词“strip”，对吧？

97
A strip club.
脱衣舞俱乐部。

98
So the verb to strip means to take off or leave without something.
所以动词“strip”意味着脱掉或离开没有某物。

99
Right, so you can strip off your clothes.
对，所以你可以脱掉你的衣服。

100
So it's usually used with clothes, right?
所以通常是用在衣服上，对吧？

101
To take off clothes, to strip.
脱衣服，脱光。

102
So you have a strip club, and in the strip club you have the, as you mentioned, the girls that are dancing and taking off their clothes.
所以你有一个脱衣舞俱乐部，在这个俱乐部里，你提到的那些跳舞的女孩正在脱衣服。

103
They are called strippers.
她们被称为脱衣舞者。

104
Okay, so stripper is a person who takes off their clothes as their job, and you can have male strippers or female strippers.
好的，脱衣舞者是以脱衣服为职业的人，可以是男性脱衣舞者或女性脱衣舞者。

105
So usually just saying stripper is a woman, and a male stripper is actually a guy.
通常说脱衣舞者是指女性，而男性脱衣舞者实际上是指男士。

106
Okay, so you have this club that's very common in many countries, and well the strippers are dancing, and now they also talked about getting a lap dance.
好的，你有这个在许多国家都很常见的俱乐部，脱衣舞者在跳舞，现在他们还谈到了坐在腿上的舞蹈。

107
Okay, now this is getting a little bit dirty.
好的，现在这有点不雅。

108
Lap is a, well it's not really a part of your body, but when you sit down in a chair, your lap is the tops of your legs.
腿部，嗯，它并不是真正的身体部位，但当你坐在椅子上时，你的腿部是你腿的上部。

109
So you can, you know, you can hold something in your lap, like your backpack.
所以你可以在腿上放东西，比如你的背包。

110
Or maybe, for example, if you have a child that's three or four years old, you would sit him on your lap, right, on your legs while you're sitting down, maybe in subway.
或者，比如说，如果你有一个三四岁的孩子，你会让他坐在你的腿上，对吧，坐在你坐着的腿上，也许是在地铁上。

111
Right, or a laptop computer is the kind of computer you can hold on your lap.
对，或者笔记本电脑是你可以放在腿上的那种电脑。

112
So a lap dance is when one of the female strippers comes and kind of dances on your lap.
所以坐在腿上的舞蹈是指其中一位女性脱衣舞者过来在你腿上跳舞。

113
Exactly, and so it's a sexy dance.
正是如此，所以这是一种性感的舞蹈。

114
You pay for it extra, and it's something that is very popular with young men and people who, you know, these grooms and groomsmen before the groom gets married.
你为此额外付费，这在年轻男性和那些在新郎结婚前的伴郎中非常受欢迎。

115
Right, alright.

And moving on, we have the last word for today, gag gifts.
接下来，我们有今天的最后一个词，恶搞礼物。

117

118
They're meant to be funny, they're not meant to be serious, and they're very popular at these kinds of bachelor parties and bachelorette parties.
它们是为了搞笑，不是为了严肃，这在这种单身派对和单身女派对上非常受欢迎。

119
One kind of gag gift that's just very silly is like a whoopee cushion, you know, it's like a balloon you put on someone's seat, and when they sit down, they make a farting sound.
一种非常傻的恶搞礼物就像是放屁垫，你知道的，它就像一个气球，你放在某人的座位上，当他们坐下时，会发出放屁的声音。

对，所以这些是恶搞礼物。

121
Anything that's kind of, to joke around, it's not really useful.
