We're talking about a laptop computer, so we're going to give some more details and characteristics about the computer and what makes it so special.

7
So let's take a listen to what Mr. Ford has to say about what makes this company's computers very special.
让我们听听Ford先生对这家公司电脑特别之处的看法。

8
Now, a key question you might ask yourself is what differentiates the new X420 line with our previous models?
现在，你可能会问一个关键问题，那就是新X420系列与我们之前的型号有什么不同？

And also, of course, with some of our competitors.

10
In other words, what makes the X420 stand out from all the others?
换句话说，是什么让X420在所有其他产品中脱颖而出？

11
This is a key question, and it's something I'd like to explore in a little depth.

Firstly, the X420 has a range of USPs that really make it a cut above the rest.

Compared with our previous X540 range, it really is in a league of its own.

20
Now, if we go on to look at projected sales for the X420, we can see that sales revenue for 2010 is expected to hit at least $20 million.
现在，如果我们继续看X420的预计销售，我们可以看到2010年的销售收入预计将达到至少2000万美元。

21
Now, this is really a conservative estimate.
这确实是一个保守的估计。

22
If our marketing campaign is successful, I'm confident that we could see a doubling of this figure at the very least.
如果我们的营销活动成功，我相信这个数字至少会翻倍。

23
Now, please bear in mind that this is only for the first year of production.
请记住，这仅仅是生产的第一年。

24
I'm certain that in the coming three years, the X420 will actually overtake all our existing products, both in terms of sales and revenue.

So, we obviously heard a lot of vocab here, a lot of interesting things regarding the computer.
所以，我们显然听到了很多词汇，关于这台电脑的很多有趣的事情。

28
Why don't we take a look at some of the words that he used on Language Takeaway.
为什么我们不看看他在Language Takeaway中使用的一些词呢？

29
So, the first word that is pretty challenging is to differentiate.
第一个比较有挑战性的词是“区分”。

30
It's a verb.
这是一个动词。

31
So, Mr. Ford says, ask yourself what it is that differentiates this new computer line with other ones.
Ford先生说，问问自己是什么让这条新电脑线与其他电脑不同。

32
That's right.

然后他重新表述了这个问题，他说，换句话说，是什么让X420在所有其他电脑中脱颖而出？

44
Alright, so this is a verbal phrase, to stand out, and it's very similar to the one that we just mentioned, to differentiate.

所以，我们基本上在说，为什么这台更引人注目？

49
That's to stand out.
这就是“脱颖而出”。

50
So, maybe if everyone in the office is wearing white t-shirts today, but somebody comes in wearing a red t-shirt, that person is going to stand out.
所以，也许如果办公室里每个人今天都穿着白色T恤，但有一个人穿着红色T恤，那个人就会脱颖而出。

52
You're wearing a red t-shirt today, so you stand out.

53
Okay.

54
So, now, as he continued to talk about the computer, he used this prefix before an adjective that was very interesting.
现在，当他继续谈论这台电脑时，他在一个形容词前使用了一个非常有趣的前缀。

55
He said, this computer is ultra-light, and then he said it's ultra-thin as well, and that it has an ultra-fast processor.
他说，这台电脑是超轻的，然后他说它也是超薄的，并且它有一个超快的处理器。

56
Okay, so ultra-light, ultra-fast, ultra-thin.
好的，所以超轻、超快、超薄。

57
This is a way of saying very, very.
这是一种说“非常，非常”的方式。

58
That's right.

59
So, that's what he's saying.

He's saying it's very light, it's very thin.
他在说它非常轻，非常薄。

61
So, that's pretty much the structure.

62
You can add ultra before an adjective to emphasize that it's very something.

63
That's right.

65
He was ultra-cool.
他是超酷的。

66
He was very cool.

67
That's right.
没错。

68
Okay, so you can do it with pretty much all adjectives, but you can't really exaggerate and use it all the time.
好的，所以你几乎可以对所有形容词这样做，但你不能真的夸大并且总是使用它。

69
That's right.
没错。

70
Well, the key is to remember this is an exaggeration.
好吧，关键是要记住这是夸张。

71
So, yeah, you don't want to use it all the time.
所以，是的，你不想总是使用它。

72
But if you want to emphasize that something is special, or that it's very, very something, you use the word ultra.
但如果你想强调某事是特别的，或者它非常，非常某种东西，你就使用“超”这个词。

73
That's right.

75
What does he mean by crystal clear?
他所说的“清晰”是什么意思？

76
Well, crystal is a very special kind of glass, right?
嗯，水晶是一种非常特殊的玻璃，对吧？

77
And so it's expensive, it's what some people have as their special glassware, you know, wine glasses and drinking glasses.
所以它很贵，有些人把它作为他们的特殊玻璃器皿，比如酒杯和饮水杯。

78
And so crystal is very special because it's so clear to see through.
所以水晶非常特别，因为它非常透明。

79
So transparent.
所以透明。

80
It's transparent.
它是透明的。

81
Light goes through it, you can see everything.

83
It's extremely clear.
它极其清晰。

84
It's as clear as crystal.

90
And then moving away from the characteristics of the computer, he talked about projected sales, and he expected $20 million.
然后，离开电脑的特点，他谈到了预计销售，他预计2000万美元。

91
But he said that that is a very conservative estimate.
但他说这是一个非常保守的估计。

92
Okay, so an estimate is like a guess.
好的，所以估计就像是一个猜测。

93
It's how much we think we will earn in a year or how much we think will happen.
这是我们认为一年内会赚多少钱，或者我们认为会发生多少。

94
But in this case, a conservative estimate means that it's a low estimate.
但在这种情况下，保守的估计意味着这是一个低估计。

95
You know, we might make $20 million next year.

98
So that's not conservative.

That's right.
