And my name is Catherine.

And today we're going to be visiting one of my favorite places, I must say.
今天我们要去我最喜欢的地方之一。

5
Really, so you're a big meat eater.
真的，你是个大肉食者。

6
I am.
是的。

7
I have to have meat every day, so that's why I usually go to the butcher.
我每天都要吃肉，所以我通常去肉店。

8
Alright, so vegetarians be warned.
好吧，素食者请注意。

9
Today's dialogue is all about eating meat and where to go to get meat.
今天的对话全是关于吃肉和去哪里买肉。

10
So, as Marco said, that place is called The Butcher's.
正如Marco所说，那地方叫肉店。

11
So we're going to be visiting The Butcher, and we're going to learn all the different types of meat you can find there.
我们将去肉店，了解那里可以找到的各种肉类。

12
Great, so we don't have anything to preview, but before we get started, I'd just like to mention that you're going to hear a lot of different kinds of words, and we'll be back in a minute to talk about what they mean.
很好，我们没有什么要预览的，但在开始之前，我想提一下，你会听到很多不同的词，我们会在一分钟后回来讨论它们的意思。

13
Hi, what can I get for you?
你好，我能为你做些什么？

14
I'd like half a pound of ground beef, please.
我想要半磅的牛肉末。

15
Good choice.
好选择。

16
Our ground beef is extra lean, if you know what I mean.
我们的牛肉末是特瘦的，你懂的。

17
Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breast?
我还可以要半打猪排和两磅去骨鸡胸肉吗？

18
No, no, no chicken breasts at the moment, but we have some nice chicken thighs.
不，不，现在没有鸡胸肉，但我们有一些不错的鸡腿。

19
No, that won't do.
不，这不行。

20
I'll take this smoked ham you have here.
我就要你这里的烟熏火腿。

21
Okay, is there anything else?
好的，还有其他需要吗？

22
Is this salami and Bologna you have here?

23
Yes, it's very fine meat.
是的，肉质非常好。

24
Made it myself.
我自己做的。

25
Sounds good.
听起来不错。

26
Okay, that's it.
好的，就这些。

27
Wait, we have t-bone, ribeye, and sirloin sticks.
等等，我们有T骨、肋眼和西冷牛排。

28
They are very fresh.
它们非常新鲜。

29
Just came from the slaughterhouse.
刚从屠宰场过来。

30
No, that's okay, really.
不，没关系，真的。

31
I think that's all for today.
我想今天就这些。

32
Okay, that'll be $34.50.
好的，总共34.50美元。

33
Alright, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

34
So this butcher was kind of creepy in the beginning.
所以这个肉贩一开始有点可怕。

35
Very creepy in the beginning.
一开始非常可怕。

36
I think that's usually the conception that you have of butchers because they always have a knife.
我想这通常是你对肉贩的印象，因为他们总是拿着刀。

37
And they're always covered in blood, but it's not human blood.
而且他们总是沾满血，但不是人血。

38
Right, like the movie Sweeney Todd.
对，就像电影《理发师陶德》。

39
Did you see that?
你看过吗？

40
Yeah, like Sweeney Todd.
是的，就像《理发师陶德》。

41
The butcher of Fleet Street.
《弗利特街的肉贩》。

42
But we actually took a look at a lot of different types of meat that the woman was ordering.
但我们实际上看了很多女人点的不同种类的肉。

43
So why don't we take a look at these now in Language Takeaway.
那我们现在来看看这些肉在语言收获中。

44
Okay, so the first is a classic cut.
好的，第一个是经典切割。

45
This is something that we had at my house about once a week growing up.
这是我小时候每周大约吃一次的东西。

46
It's called a pork chop.
叫做猪排。

47
Pork chop.
猪排。

48
So a pork chop comes from the animal, the pork or pig.
猪排来自猪。

49
Yeah, we actually don't say pork to mean the animal.
是的，我们实际上不说猪来指代动物。

50
Pork just means the kind of meat that comes from a pig.
猪肉只是指来自猪的肉。

51
So big difference there when we're talking about food, we say pork.
所以在谈论食物时，我们说猪肉。

52
Oh, wow.
哦，哇。

53
And what about a pork chop?
那猪排呢？

54
So what exactly is that?
那到底是什么？

55
Chop is usually just on the bone.
排骨通常是带骨的。

56
And oftentimes it's fried.
而且通常是炸的。

57
Or baked, I guess.
或者烤的，我想。

58
But it's just a piece of pork on the bone.
但它只是带骨的猪肉一块。

59
And a chop, you just imagine a knife chopping something.
而且排骨，你可以想象刀切东西。

60
Alright, so a pork chop.
好吧，所以猪排。

61
Very good.
非常好。

62
And after pork chops, we were ordering some ground beef.
在猪排之后，我们点了一些牛肉末。

63
Alright, so ground beef is another important one.
好吧，牛肉末是另一个重要的。

64
Ground beef is beef that's been chopped up and pushed through a machine that kind of pushes it out in very, very small bits and pieces.
牛肉末是被切碎并通过机器压成非常小的块的牛肉。

65
There's no bones.
没有骨头。

66
So ground comes from the verb to grind.
所以牛肉末来自动词“磨”。

67
So to grind up meat, to make it very, very small pieces.
所以磨肉，就是把肉切成非常小的块。

68
Right, so if you want to make a spaghetti bolognese, the kind of beef you use is ground beef, or even hamburgers.
对，所以如果你想做意大利肉酱，使用的牛肉是牛肉末，或者汉堡。

69
Oh, yeah, exactly.
哦，是的，正是如此。

70
So ground beef, you ground up beef.
所以牛肉末，你把牛肉磨碎。

71
What other things would you grind?
你还会磨其他东西吗？

72
Oh, you could grind your teeth.
哦，你可以磨牙。

73
Some people do that when they're sleeping, they grind their teeth.
有些人睡觉时会磨牙。

74
You can grind... you have pepper grinders.
你可以磨...你有胡椒磨。

75
You know, peppers sometimes come in balls, and you have to grind them to make them smaller and broken down.
你知道，胡椒有时是球状的，你必须磨碎它们使其变小。

76
Very good.
非常好。

77
So that's ground beef, and from the verb to grind.
所以这就是牛肉末，来自动词“磨”。

78
Now we are buying some boneless chicken breasts.
现在我们要买一些去骨鸡胸肉。

79
Alright, so boneless, as you have guessed, means without bones.
好吧，去骨，正如你所猜的，意味着没有骨头。

80
And chicken breasts are usually just a really nice, juicy, kind of tender cut of meat from the chicken, from the kind of underside of the chicken, where, obviously, yeah, they have it.
鸡胸肉通常是来自鸡的非常好、汁多、嫩的肉，来自鸡的底部，显然，是的，他们有。

81
It's not a wing, it's not a leg, it's just a chicken breast.
这不是翅膀，也不是腿，只是鸡胸肉。

82
Alright, so boneless chicken breast.
好吧，所以去骨鸡胸肉。

83
Now usually it is boneless, right, when you buy it at the supermarket.
通常在超市买的时候是去骨的，对吧？

84
Yeah, yeah.
是的，是的。

85
Next up we've got some classic deli counter favorites.
接下来我们有一些经典的熟食柜台最爱。

86
These are our cold cuts.
这些是我们的冷切肉。

87
Alright, so cold cuts.
好吧，冷切肉。

88
Now this means that they are cold?
这意味着它们是冷的吗？

89
Oh, well, yeah, they're cold, but I think cold cuts, the most important thing to remember here is that they're mostly like kinds of salami or cured meats.
哦，嗯，是的，它们是冷的，但我认为冷切肉，最重要的是要记住的是，它们大多是意大利香肠或腌制肉。

90
So these are salt cured or they're dried meats.
所以这些是盐腌或干肉。

91
And you usually have them on sandwiches, so like a salami sandwich.
你通常在三明治上吃，比如意大利香肠三明治。

92
So like cured meat, you mean that meat hasn't been cooked?
所以像腌制肉，你是说那肉没有被煮熟？

93
Oh, no, it's not been cooked, but it's treated in a way that allows it to last for a very long time.
哦，不，它没有被煮熟，但它以某种方式处理，使其可以保存很长时间。

94
So they look like long, long tubes of meat.
所以它们看起来像长长的肉管。

95
Or they look very dry.
或者看起来非常干。

96
They look very dry, like beef jerky, for example.
它们看起来非常干，比如牛肉干。

97
Alright, so cured meat.
好吧，所以腌制肉。

98
Now, for example, we have salami and Bologna.
例如，我们有意大利香肠和博洛尼亚。

99
Bologna.
博洛尼亚。

100
Now, it's interesting because Bologna is actually spelled B-O-L-O-G-N-A.
有趣的是，博洛尼亚的拼写是B-O-L-O-G-N-A。

101
So you would say Bologna, Bologna, or something like that.
所以你会说博洛尼亚，博洛尼亚，或者类似的东西。

102
Well, I think it comes from the Italian Bologna.
嗯，我认为它来自意大利的博洛尼亚。

103
But it's definitely a change that happened in the English language when it came over from Italy.
但这绝对是英语在从意大利过来的时候发生的变化。

104
But Bologna is a kind of meat that's got a very funny looking name.
但博洛尼亚是一种肉，名字看起来很有趣。

105
Yeah, see, you're more sophisticated than I am.
是的，看到吗，你比我更复杂。

106
That's why you know the difference.
所以你知道区别。

107
I just speak Italian.
我只是会说意大利语。

108
Alright, so you have salami, Bologna, and pastrami.
好吧，所以你有萨拉米，博洛尼亚和帕斯特拉米。

109
What about ham?
火腿呢？

110
Is that considered a cold cut?
那算不算冷切？

111
You can have ham in the cold cut section because ham sometimes comes in tubes that you slice.
你可以在冷切区找到火腿，因为火腿有时是装在你切的管子里。

112
But ham is also just a normal kind of pork.
但火腿也是一种普通的猪肉。

113
But ham is cured, you know.
但火腿是腌制的，你知道。

114
Like smoked ham.
就像烟熏火腿。

115
Exactly.
正是。

116
Or smoked Turkey, one of my favorites.
或者烟熏火鸡，我最喜欢的之一。

117
Very good.
非常好。

118
And now moving on from the cold cuts, we're going to concentrate on steaks.
现在从冷切转到牛排，我们要集中讨论牛排。

119
Ooh, steaks.
哦，牛排。

120
So there are a thousand kinds of steaks in this world and every city seems to have its own kind.
这个世界上有成千上万种牛排，每个城市似乎都有自己的一种。

121
But here we're only looking at three, the first of which is the T-bone.
但在这里我们只看三种，第一种是T骨牛排。

122
Alright, the T-bone steak I think is one of the most popular ones.
好吧，T骨牛排我认为是最受欢迎的之一。

123
It's a steak that's pretty big, right?
这是一块相当大的牛排，对吧？

124
Yeah, well, yeah, it can be.
是的，嗯，是的，可能是。

125
And it has a bone inside that looks like a T.
它里面有一根看起来像T的骨头。

126
Alright, so you're saying, Marco, that the T-bone is named after the shape and the look of this steak.
好吧，所以你在说，马尔科，T骨牛排是根据这块牛排的形状和外观命名的。

127
Yeah, T-bone steak.
是的，T骨牛排。

128
Alright.
好吧。

129
And as well as our next one is also a rib eye.
还有我们的下一个是肋眼牛排。

130
Okay, so the rib eye I think actually has a piece of the rib in it.
好吧，我认为肋眼实际上有一块肋骨在里面。

131
So the rib is the bone and there's a circle, which is kind of a... The piece of meat is sliced off the rib and the circle is actually part of that rib.
所以肋骨是骨头，有一个圆圈，肉块是从肋骨上切下来的，圆圈实际上是那根肋骨的一部分。

132
So there's a little bit of bone in it.
所以里面有一点骨头。

133
But it's not as bony as the T-bone.
但它没有T骨那么多骨头。

134
Right.
对。

135
So it does have one small bone that kind of looks like an eye because you can see through it.
所以它确实有一小块骨头，看起来像眼睛，因为你可以透过它。

136
And our next steak has no bone and is the most tender and the best steak you can have, sirloin steak.
而我们的下一个牛排没有骨头，是最嫩的，也是你能吃到的最好的牛排，西冷牛排。

137
So I think the sirloin is definitely the most expensive if you're in a restaurant.
所以我认为西冷牛排绝对是最贵的，如果你在餐厅里。

138
Definitely the most tender, I think, of all those kinds.
绝对是所有种类中最嫩的，我认为。

139
And usually you can have like a big sirloin steak, like a half a kilo, like a 400 gram sirloin steak.
通常你可以吃一块大西冷牛排，比如半公斤，像400克的西冷牛排。

140
I had a friend who ate a full kilo sirloin steak.
我有一个朋友吃了一公斤的西冷牛排。

141

不，这是一种叫做佛罗伦萨牛排的牛排，在意大利。

145

146
And it can be about a kilo of meat.
它可以有大约一公斤的肉。

147
Wow.

148
I bet you can't even move after that.
我敢打赌你吃完后连动都动不了。

149
No, you fall asleep with your head in your soup on the table.
不，你会在桌子上的汤里睡着。

150
Alright, so that's all the meat-related words that we have for you today.
好吧，这就是我们今天为你准备的所有与肉相关的词汇。

151
So why don't we move on now to Fluency Builder where we're going to take a look at some of the phrases in this dialogue.

你在说我想说的有双重含义。

165
So there's two things I could say and I'm not going to say it outright, but, you know, this thing that we can't really say.
所以我可以说两件事，我不会直接说出来，但，你知道，这件我们不能真的说的事情。

166
So for example, we can say... She likes to go out, if you know what I mean.

168
A lot, or maybe she gets drunk or something like that.

So it's kind of like a double meaning, but you're trying to be subtle?

171
Yeah, but it's not so subtle because you're actually saying like, this is not what I mean.

191
So this one is a counting phrase.
所以这个是一个计数短语。

195
So that means half of twelve.
所以这意味着十二的一半。

211
This is not like resting on something.

212
This is actually a kind of way to describe food.

213
And so food is lean if it's not got much fat.

214
It's not fatty.
它不是油腻的。

215
Okay, so if it's lean, it doesn't have much fat.

Yeah, in America, actually, on the packages at the supermarket, it often says the percentage of meat that you have.

225
So it's 95% lean or 98% lean.
所以是95%瘦或98%瘦。

226
So that means you have 3% fat in there.
