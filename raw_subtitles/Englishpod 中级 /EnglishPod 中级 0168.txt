Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.
大家好，欢迎回到EnglishPod。

2
My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

3
And my name is Catherine, and today we have an advanced media level lesson, so that's the very highest of our levels.
我叫Catherine，今天我们有一节高级媒体课程，这是我们所有课程中最高级的。

4
Right.
对。

5
And we're going to be talking about a very popular tradition in North America, a Thanksgiving dinner.
我们将讨论北美一个非常流行的传统，感恩节晚餐。

6
Okay, so Thanksgiving is a very special holiday for Americans, and Canadians also celebrate it.
好的，感恩节对美国人来说是一个非常特殊的节日，加拿大人也庆祝这个节日。

7
But on different dates, right?
但日期不同，对吗？

8
Canadians have it on a different date.
加拿大人在不同的日期庆祝。

9
Exactly.
正确。

10
I'm not sure what the Canadian date is, but Americans celebrate it.
我不确定加拿大的日期是什么，但美国人在11月底庆祝，日期每年都变，因为是星期四。

11
At the end of November, the day changes every year because it's a Thursday.
但我们通常会放假，不上班或上学，大家一起吃饭，庆祝这一年，庆祝丰收，庆祝我们的家人和朋友。

12
But we usually have the day off from work or school, and we all eat together and celebrate the year and celebrate the harvest and celebrate our families and friends.

13
So this tradition of Thanksgiving, what do you commemorate, or what do you celebrate?
那么这个感恩节的传统，你们纪念什么，或者庆祝什么？

14
Well, we actually celebrate the first harvest that the pilgrims had when they were right off the boat in New England.
嗯，我们实际上是庆祝朝圣者在新英格兰刚下船时的第一次丰收。

15
So that's the eastern part of America.
所以这是美国的东部。

16
These people had come from England, and they were trying to find a new land and a new life, and they ended up in the Massachusetts area.
这些人来自英格兰，他们试图寻找新的土地和新的生活，最后来到了马萨诸塞州。

17
And they didn't know how to farm.
他们不知道如何耕作。

18
They didn't know how to work the land.
他们不知道如何利用土地。

19
And so the Native Americans who were living there at the time helped them out, helped them grow corn, helped them find out how to use the land in a productive way.
所以当时住在那里的美洲土著帮助了他们，帮助他们种玉米，帮助他们找到有效利用土地的方法。

20
And so when that first harvest happened, everyone was able to grow, it was actually a year after they arrived, everyone was able to grow corn and food and crops, and then they all shared a meal together to celebrate this wonderful occasion.
所以当第一次丰收发生时，大家都能种植，实际上是在他们到达一年后，大家都能种玉米和食物，然后大家一起分享一顿饭来庆祝这个美好的时刻。

21
Wow.
哇。

22
And it actually helped them survive the winter, because most of the pilgrims, most of the settlers, they died during the first winter.
这实际上帮助他们度过了冬天，因为大多数朝圣者，大多数定居者，在第一个冬天都死了。

23
And so this was a really great, great thing for them.
所以这对他们来说真的是一件很伟大的事情。

24
Wow.
哇。

25
That's really interesting, an interesting aspect of history and why this is celebrated, mostly, as you say, in North America and Canada, and that's why many other countries don't really have it.
这真的很有趣，这是历史的一个有趣方面，为什么这主要在北美和加拿大庆祝，这也是为什么许多其他国家没有这个节日。

26
But it's a popular get-together, and, well, what you usually have is a Turkey, right?
但这是一个受欢迎的聚会，嗯，你通常会吃火鸡，对吗？

27
Exactly.
正确。

28
So Turkey is a very big bird, and they go gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, and they have that kind of really red, long kind of thing on their necks, and big tail, or big tail feathers.
所以火鸡是一种非常大的鸟，它们会咯咯叫，并且脖子上有那种非常红、很长的东西，还有大尾巴或大尾羽。

29
And they're delicious.
而且它们非常美味。

30
But the funny thing is about Turkey that there's a chemical in it that makes you very sleepy.
但有趣的是，火鸡中有一种化学物质会让你非常困。

31
Well, not a chemical, there's a protein in it that makes you very sleepy.
嗯，不是化学物质，里面有一种蛋白质会让你非常困。

32
Oh really?
哦，真的吗？

33
I didn't know that.
我不知道。

34
And so the joke is that after you eat dinner on Thanksgiving, everyone falls asleep on the sofa.
所以笑话是，感恩节晚餐后，大家都会在沙发上睡着。

35
Well, Thanksgiving meals in the United States are very, very big.
嗯，美国的感恩节晚餐非常非常丰盛。

36
They're very elaborate, right?
它们非常复杂，对吗？

37
You not only have Turkey, but you have pumpkin pie, and you have mashed potatoes, and gravy, and just like a table full of food.
你不仅有火鸡，还有南瓜派，土豆泥，肉汁，还有满桌的食物。

38
Exactly, and it's a way to celebrate, well, to give thanks for all the things that you have, and so we like to give, like to cook a lot of food to celebrate that.
正确，这是一种庆祝的方式，嗯，感谢你所拥有的一切，所以我们喜欢做很多食物来庆祝。

39
And they're all fall foods, so squash, pumpkin, potatoes, things like that.
而且它们都是秋季食物，比如南瓜、土豆等。

40
Alright, so we have a dialogue here, so it's just that.
好吧，我们这里有一个对话，就这样。

41
It's a guy who is preparing a Turkey dinner and also preparing pumpkin pie, but he's doing it in a very peculiar way, so why don't we listen to the dialogue, and then we'll come back and just talk a little bit about the different terms that he used.
这是一个准备火鸡晚餐的人，同时也在准备南瓜派，但他以一种非常特别的方式进行，所以我们来听听对话，然后再回来讨论一下他使用的不同术语。

42
Hello everyone, and welcome back to our show.

So I think this is gonna be one great Thanksgiving dinner for him.

79
Oh my gosh, and talking about this is making me so hungry.
哇，谈论这个让我好饿。

80
This always happens when we have food lessons.
每当我们有食物课程时，总是这样。

81
What about, do you have any family members who actually drink a little bit too much during Thanksgiving?
你有没有家人实际上在感恩节喝得有点多？

82
Yes, and I won't say who.
有的，我不会说是谁。

83
All right.
好吧。

84
So as he was preparing the Thanksgiving dinner, he mentioned a couple of things.
所以当他准备感恩节晚餐时，他提到了一些事情。

85
For example, a mouth-watering Turkey.
例如，令人垂涎的火鸡。

86
Mouth-watering.
垂涎欲滴。

87
So this is a way to say appetizing.
这是一种说法，表示开胃。

88
You know when you see something delicious on TV and, mmm, yeah, your mouth starts to water.
你知道，当你在电视上看到美味的东西时，嗯，是的，你的口水开始流。

89
You're salivating.
你在流口水。

90
That means that your brain is telling you that you want to eat it.
这意味着你的大脑在告诉你你想吃它。

91
Right.
对。

92
And so your mouth starts to water.
所以你的口水开始流。

93
So we say that something that's very appetizing, something that looks like it will taste very, very good, it's mouth-watering.
所以我们说某样东西非常开胃，看起来会非常好吃，它就是令人垂涎的。

94
All right, so he was preparing a mouth-watering Turkey.
好吧，所以他在准备一只令人垂涎的火鸡。

95
So moving on, he mentioned that he had a key ingredient for his Turkey, and it was whiskey.
接下来，他提到他有一个火鸡的关键成分，那就是威士忌。

96
Not only whiskey, but 12-year whiskey.
不仅是威士忌，还有12年威士忌。

97
Okay, so the thing about whiskeys is that oftentimes on the label of a bottle, they'll advertise how old the whiskey is, because you pay more for older whiskeys.
好吧，关于威士忌的事情是，瓶子的标签上通常会宣传威士忌的年龄，因为你为更老的威士忌支付更多。

98
They just, they have a better taste in many cases.
它们在许多情况下味道更好。

99
Well, I guess it depends, but in this case, it's a 12-year whiskey.
嗯，我想这要看情况，但在这种情况下，这是12年威士忌。

100
That means that it was stored in a cask for 12 years to let it age, and then they sell it after 12 years.
这意味着它在桶中存放了12年以让其陈酿，然后在12年后出售。

101
And so that's the special ingredient.
所以这就是特别的成分。

102
That's the special ingredient.
这就是特别的成分。

103
12-year whiskey, and well, he not only put it on the Turkey, but also he had a couple of drinks himself, and in one of those, he mentioned that hit the spot.
12年威士忌，他不仅把它放在火鸡上，还自己喝了几杯，在其中一杯中，他提到这正合适。

104
Mmm, that hit the spot.
嗯，这正合适。

105
What spot?
什么合适？

106
The spot.
就是那个合适。

107
Okay, so this is a really common phrase in English that we use to say that something is very satisfying.
好吧，这在英语中是一个非常常见的短语，我们用它来表示某事非常令人满意。

108
So that hit the spot, and not only for drinks, right?
所以这正合适，不仅仅是饮料，对吧？

109
No, you could use it for food or anything really.
不，你可以用它来形容食物或任何东西。

110
So in this case, I could say, oh, I was so hungry, that sandwich really hit the spot.
所以在这种情况下，我可以说，哦，我太饿了，那三明治真是太合适了。

111
I really needed to eat right now, and that sandwich was perfect.
我现在真的需要吃东西，而那个三明治正好。

112
That was perfect.
那真是完美。

113
All right, so that hit the spot.
好吧，那正合适。

114
Now, when he referred to the Turkey, in one occasion he said, we place our bird on a rack.
现在，当他提到火鸡时，有一次他说，我们把鸟放在架子上。

115
All right, so what's a bird, and what's the rack?
好吧，鸟是什么，架子又是什么？

116
Okay, so this is really interesting.
好吧，这真的很有趣。

117
We talk about the Turkey oftentimes when we're making commercials or talking about recipes as the bird.
我们在制作广告或谈论食谱时，常常把火鸡称为鸟。

118
So you want to take out the bird, and you want to open the packaging.
所以你想把鸟拿出来，打开包装。

119
So the bird is the Turkey.
所以鸟就是火鸡。

120
A Turkey is a kind of bird.
火鸡是一种鸟。

121
You can say this about chicken as well, because it's another kind of bird, but this is a kind of a colloquial term in cooking for whatever bird you're cooking.
你也可以这样说鸡，因为它是另一种鸟，但这是烹饪中对任何你正在烹饪的鸟的口语用法。

122
Right, okay.
对，好的。

123
And when you're placing it on a rack, what's a rack?
当你把它放在架子上时，架子是什么？

124
Okay, so in our ovens, an oven is it's a kitchen item, appliance, that you you have that heats up food, but it's not like a microwave.
好吧，在我们的烤箱中，烤箱是一个厨房电器，用来加热食物，但它不是微波炉。

125
It's much stronger, and so inside there are metal bars.
它强得多，里面有金属条。

126
We don't have, they're like shelves, but they're open.
我们没有，它们像架子，但它们是开放的。

127
And so these metal bars are called a rack.
所以这些金属条叫做架子。

128
Okay, so you put the Turkey in the oven on the rack.
好吧，所以你把火鸡放在烤箱的架子上。

129
Right, you can't put it on the on the base of the oven because then it would burn up.
对，你不能把它放在烤箱的底部，因为那样会烧焦。

130
Exactly, and you you don't have a shelf because that would be a problem.
正是如此，你没有架子，因为那会是个问题。

131
All right, and well, moving on on the instructions when he was preparing the pumpkin pie, he told us to lightly whisk together two eggs.
好吧，继续，当他准备南瓜派时，他告诉我们轻轻打散两个鸡蛋。

132
So we have a verb here, to whisk.
所以我们这里有一个动词，打散。

133
To whisk.
打散。

134
So that's not only a verb but a noun as well, right?
所以这不仅是一个动词，也是一个名词，对吧？

135
All right, it's an instrument.
好吧，这是一个工具。

136
Exactly, and this is a verb we often use with eggs, so to whisk eggs.
正是如此，这个动词我们通常用来形容鸡蛋，所以打散鸡蛋。

137
You can also whisk like a sauce for a salad, so like a salad dressing.
你也可以打散沙拉酱，所以像沙拉调料。

138
But it's a way that we stir something, and so oftentimes we have an instrument called a whisk that's not like a fork, it actually looks kind of funny.
但这是一种搅拌东西的方式，所以我们通常有一个叫做打蛋器的工具，它不像叉子，实际上看起来有点搞笑。

139
It's got bars on it.
它有条状的。

140
Like wire that kind of make a circle.
像是金属丝，形成一个圆圈。

141
Exactly, and they are very thin wires.
正是如此，它们是非常细的金属丝。

142
And you usually stir very very very quickly, especially if you have eggs, this will break up the egg and it becomes kind of foamy.
你通常搅拌得非常非常快，尤其是如果你有鸡蛋，这会打破鸡蛋，变得有点泡沫。

143
Foamy, yeah.
泡沫，是的。

144
To make like an omelet, for example.
比如说做一个煎蛋卷。

145
Exactly, so to whisk is a kind of, it's a way to stir.
正是如此，所以打散是一种搅拌的方式。

146
Okay, and then he mentioned some ingredients such as sugar, spices, and grated nutmeg.
好吧，然后他提到了一些成分，比如糖、香料和磨碎的肉豆蔻。

147
So what is this verb, grated nutmeg, or an adjective, grated?
那么这个动词，磨碎的肉豆蔻，或者形容词，磨碎的是什么？

148
Exactly, so this adjective grated means that, well, it's a kind of way to cut up something, and so you often hear the term grated cheese.
正是如此，这个形容词磨碎的意思是，这是一种切割东西的方式，所以你常常会听到磨碎的奶酪。

149
That means not a big chunk of cheese, but we push it against a board to get little pieces of it to fall off, and that's called grated cheese.
这意味着不是一大块奶酪，而是我们把它推到一个板上，让小块掉下来，这叫做磨碎的奶酪。

150
And so in this case we have grated nutmeg, that means that it's been kind of, the nutmeg comes in in very small pieces.
所以在这种情况下，我们有磨碎的肉豆蔻，这意味着它已经被切成非常小的块。

151
Yeah, pieces, and we we're breaking it down.
是的，块，我们正在把它打碎。

152
All right, very good.
好吧，非常好。

153
And he also mentioned something about bringing the sauce to a simmering point.
他还提到了一些关于将酱汁煮至微开状态的事情。

154
What is that simmering point?
什么是微开状态？

155
Okay, simmering point is a time when you're cooking where the liquid goes from being calm to being very agitated and moving.
好吧，微开状态是你在烹饪时，液体从平静变得非常激动和流动的时刻。

156
But it's not boiling, right?
但这不是沸腾，对吧？

157
No, boiling means you have big bubbles, right, like boiling water.
不，沸腾意味着你有大气泡，对吧，就像沸腾的水。

158
But simmering is where it's kind of little bubble, there's a little bit of action on the surface of the liquid, but it's not boiling, it's in the middle between flat and calm, and agitated and boiling.
但微开是指有小气泡，液体表面有一点动作，但它不是沸腾，它在平静和激动、沸腾之间的中间状态。

159
Okay, so that's the simmering point, very good.
好吧，所以这就是微开状态，非常好。

160
And that's pretty much all of the interesting phrases in the dialogue, there are a lot more, but we don't really have time to cover that huge amount of rich vocabulary, so why don't we listen to this dialogue one last time?
这基本上是对话中所有有趣的短语，还有很多，但我们真的没有时间涵盖那么丰富的词汇，所以我们为什么不再听一次这个对话呢？

161

现在在许多电影中，他们有点嘲笑这个节日，因为这是一个大家聚在一起的时刻，无论宗教、信仰或种族，这也导致许多家庭成员聚在一起争论和讨论政治或谈论家庭问题等等。
