50
But it's generally considered a drink for ladies, for women.
但通常被认为是女士的饮料。

51
Why is that?
为什么呢？

52
Probably because it's a weaker drink, but also because it's popular in the media and in movies and stuff as a woman's drink.
可能因为它是一种较弱的饮料，但也因为它在媒体和电影中作为女性饮料而流行。

53
So that's how it got that reputation.

55
All right, very good.
好的，非常好。

56
So that's what a Cosmo is.

57
Now, if we move on to another very popular drink, a little bit more tropical, I think everyone always has it in the Caribbean or when they're on vacation at the beach.
现在，如果我们转到另一种非常受欢迎的饮料，更热带一点，我想每个人在加勒比海或度假时总是会喝。

58
It's called a Sex on the Beach.
它叫Sex on the Beach。

59
Okay, this name might make you laugh because Sex on the Beach, it's very descriptive, but it's actually a very common drink.

60
And in the dialogue, he talks about how he likes to have this drink served in a pineapple or a coconut.
在对话中，他提到他喜欢把这饮料放在菠萝或椰子里。

67
So it's very fruity.
所以它非常水果味。

68
It's kind of like a milkshake with liquor.
有点像加了酒的奶昔。

69
Weird.
奇怪。

70
Yeah, I don't know that I've ever had one.
是的，我不知道我是否喝过。

71
But this is the part of the dialogue where his friend says, Come on, you need to buy something that's more manly.
但这是对话中他朋友说的部分，来吧，你需要买一些更男人的饮料。

72
He orders a scotch on the rocks instead.
他点了一杯加冰的苏格兰威士忌。

73
Okay, so a scotch is a type of liquor.
好吧，苏格兰威士忌是一种烈酒。

74
It's a whiskey.
它是一种威士忌。

75
That's right.
没错。

76
Scotch whiskey comes from Scotland.
苏格兰威士忌来自苏格兰。

77
And it's a whiskey drink.
它是一种威士忌饮料。

78
And basically scotch on the rocks means scotch poured over ice.
基本上，苏格兰威士忌加冰意味着苏格兰威士忌倒在冰上。

79
Ice.

80
So in this case, rocks means ice.
在这种情况下，rocks指的是冰。

81
And you'll hear this often.

82
Do you want that on the rocks?
你想要加冰吗？

83
Do you want that on ice?
你想要加冰吗？

84
Right.

85
So you don't say I want whiskey with ice or you don't say I want scotch with ice.
所以你不会说我想要加冰的威士忌，或者你不会说我想要加冰的苏格兰威士忌。

86
You can just say on the rocks.
你可以直接说加冰。

87
Scotch on the rocks.
苏格兰威士忌加冰。

88
So it maybe if you're ordering a rum drink and you don't want it mixed with anything, you can say rum on the rocks.
所以如果你点一杯朗姆酒饮料而不想混合任何东西，你可以说朗姆酒加冰。

89
On the rocks.
加冰。

90
Very good.
非常好。

91
And not only are we ordering a scotch on the rocks, but we're also ordering a Manhattan.

103
Although they sometimes put a little bit of lemon or orange rind in the drink, and that's the skin of the orange.
虽然他们有时会在饮料中放一点柠檬或橙皮，那是橙子的皮。

104
Okay, so both these drinks are pretty strong.
好吧，这两种饮料都很强烈。

105
They're very interesting, though.

106
All the ones that we've seen, the Cosmo, the Sex on the Beach, they're all called cocktails.

107
And a cocktail has the characteristic that it usually has alcohol, right?

So now let's talk a little bit more about these drinks on Fluency Builder.
现在让我们在流利表达中再多谈谈这些饮料。

142
Fluency Builder.
流利表达。

143
So Marco, there are many different ways to talk about drinks, but the most important ones that we often discuss, especially with cocktails, is weak drinks versus strong drinks.
所以Marco，有很多不同的方式来谈论饮料，但我们经常讨论的最重要的，尤其是鸡尾酒，是弱饮料和强饮料。

144
That's right.
没错。

145
Weak drinks versus strong drinks.
弱饮料和强饮料。

146
Now, usually the Cosmo or maybe the Sex on the Beach, it's considered to be a weak drink.
通常Cosmo或Sex on the Beach被认为是弱饮料。

147
That's right.
没错。

148
So it's not very strong because there's less alcohol.
所以它不是很强，因为酒精含量较少。

149
Like a Cosmo has fruit juice, like cranberry juice, and the Sex on the Beach is very fruity.
像Cosmo有果汁，比如蔓越莓汁，而Sex on the Beach则非常果味。

150
So it makes it less alcohol-y.
所以它的酒精含量较低。

151
That's right.
没错。

152
And actually, those two also have one type of alcohol.
其实这两种饮料也只有一种酒精。

153
So it's not very strong.
所以它不是很强。

154
Whereas maybe a Manhattan has all this mix of bourbon and other drinks as well.
而曼哈顿可能有波本威士忌和其他饮料的混合。

155
So it will be strong, strong alcoholic drink.
所以它会是强烈的酒精饮料。

156
Yeah.
是的。

157
And Scotch on the Rocks is also very strong because it's just scotch.
苏格兰威士忌加冰也很强，因为它只是威士忌。

158
Right.
对。

159
You're not mixing it with anything.
你没有和其他东西混合。

160
No, there's just some ice and some scotch.
不，只有一些冰和威士忌。

161
So that's a strong drink.
所以这是一种强饮料。

162
OK.
好的。

163
So obviously, his friend was saying that all those drinks are too weak.
所以显然，他的朋友说所有这些饮料都太弱了。

164
He should order something with a little more kick to it.
他应该点一些更有劲的饮料。

165
So in this context, kick means strength.
在这个上下文中，劲意味着力量。

166
So alcohol, he wants a drink that's not weak, that's strong.
所以酒精，他想要一杯不弱的，强烈的饮料。

167
So a strong drink has more kick than a weak drink.
所以强饮料比弱饮料更有劲。

168
So can we use this with food or with other situations?
那我们可以用这个来形容食物或其他情况吗？

169
You can, but with food, it usually means spice.
可以，但在食物中，通常意味着香料。

170
So Indian food tends to have a lot of kick to it.
所以印度食物往往很有劲。

171
That means it's very spicy.
这意味着它非常辣。

172
OK.
好的。

173
So with alcohol, it's strong.
所以在酒精中，它是强烈的。

174
With food, it's usually spicy.
在食物中，通常是辛辣的。

175
If this rice has a kick to it, it means it's a little spicy.
如果这米饭有劲，意味着它有点辣。

176
That's right.
没错。

177
So just think about kick as meaning that something is strong or has a strong flavor.
所以只需将劲视为意味着某物强烈或有强烈的味道。

178
OK, very good.
好的，非常好。

179
Now, when they were ordering, they didn't pay immediately because she said, put it on my tab.
现在，当他们点饮料时，他们没有立即付款，因为她说，把它记在我的账上。

180
All right.
好的。

181
So to put something on a tab, this is really important when you're going to a bar or a restaurant and you want to order drinks.
所以把东西记在账上，这在你去酒吧或餐厅时非常重要，想要点饮料。

182
A tab is a bill that you don't pay immediately.
账单是你不立即支付的账单。

183
Right.
对。

184
The bartender will write down all of the drinks that you have and all of their prices and you pay when you leave.
酒保会记下你喝的所有饮料及其价格，你在离开时付款。

185
OK, so if you put something on your tab, you'll pay it later or when you leave.
好的，所以如果你把东西记在账上，你会稍后付款或在离开时付款。

186
That's right.
没错。

187
So normally at a bar in America, you say, I want to start a tab.
所以通常在美国的酒吧，你会说，我想开始一个账单。

188
That means I want to start a bill.
这意味着我想开始一个账单。

189
And you give the bartender your credit card and he will keep your credit card until you leave.
然后你把信用卡给酒保，他会在你离开之前保留你的信用卡。

190
Oh, really?
哦，真的吗？

191
So he keeps your credit card intuitive because obviously maybe you start a tab and then you want to leave and you don't want to pay, then it's a problem.
所以他保留你的信用卡是因为显然你可能开始一个账单，然后你想离开而不想付款，那就麻烦了。

192
Or people get a little bit drunk and they forget they have to pay.
或者人们喝得有点醉，忘记了他们必须付款。

193
So bartenders now keep your credit card so that even if you forget to pay, they can charge you.
所以酒保现在保留你的信用卡，即使你忘记付款，他们也可以收费。

194
Oh, wow.
哦，哇。

195
OK.
好的。

196
Very interesting.
非常有趣。

197
And now for our last phrase, he was a little bit concerned because this drink is so strong.
现在对于我们的最后一句话，他有点担心，因为这饮料太强了。

198
He said, this is going to get me wasted.
他说，这会让我喝醉。

199
OK, so to be wasted or to get wasted means to get very, very drunk, to drink too much.
好的，所以喝醉或变得喝醉意味着喝得非常非常多，喝得过量。

200
So if you say I'm wasted, it means I'm very drunk.
所以如果你说我喝醉了，意味着我喝得很醉。

201
I'm very drunk.
我非常醉。

202
You could say, oh, look at those those boys over there.
你可以说，哦，看看那边的那些男孩。

203
They're all wasted.
他们都喝醉了。

204
They're all, you know, being drunk and sick.
他们都在醉酒和呕吐。

205
And yeah.
是的。

206
OK, so it's a very informal, very casual kind of a colloquial way of saying being drunk or being intoxicated.
好吧，这是一种非常非正式、非常随意的口语方式来表达醉酒或中毒。

207
That's right.
没错。

208
So it's something we often use with friends or as you know, with young people.
所以我们通常在朋友之间或年轻人中使用。

209
But it's not something you want to use in your English class because it's not a good thing to be.
但在英语课上不适合使用，因为这不是好事。

210
It's not a good thing to be wasted.
喝醉不是好事。

211
OK, very good.
好的，非常好。

212
So now let's take a break and listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.
