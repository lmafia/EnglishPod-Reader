So let's listen to our dialogue.

50
Let's see what's happening with these people that are doing laundry.

53

Okay, so I had to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so-called washing machine.
好吧，我必须把颜色和白色分开，把它们放进这个奇怪的洗衣机里。

55

57
Also be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing.

59
Okay, what about this red wine stain?

60
How do I get it out?

61
Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick.
由于这是白色T恤，你可以在上面倒一点漂白剂，它就能解决问题。

62
Cool.
酷。

63
Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it's all set, right?
然后我可以把所有东西放进烘干机烘一个小时，就可以了，对吧？

64
No.

65
Since you're washing delicates and cotton, you should set the dryer to medium heat and for 20 minutes.
由于你在洗细致和棉质衣物，你应该把烘干机设置为中等热度，20分钟。

66
You know what?
你知道吗？

67
I'll just have everything dry cleaned.
我就让所有东西干洗。

68
Okay, so we've got someone who is maybe doing the laundry for the first time and he's not really understanding the instructions he's got.
好吧，所以我们有一个可能第一次洗衣服的人，他并不真正理解他得到的指示。

69
Well, that's the thing I tell you.
嗯，这就是我告诉你的事情。

70
It's a little bit difficult and well it's very tedious at times to try and do laundry like this.
这有点困难，而且有时洗衣服真的很繁琐。

71
Well, the first thing that's maybe tedious about it is that you have to really worry about what colors go together.
嗯，可能繁琐的第一件事是你必须真正担心哪些颜色可以一起洗。

72
Right, so let's take a look at those words that were related to doing laundry now in language takeaway.
对，所以现在让我们看看与洗衣相关的那些词汇在语言收获中。

73
Language takeaway.
语言收获。

74
Okay, the first word we have is actually related to a joke we made earlier about pink socks.
好吧，我们第一个词实际上与我们之前开玩笑的粉色袜子有关。

75
So if you change the color of something, you're dyeing it.
所以如果你改变了某样东西的颜色，你就是在染色。

76
Okay, dye.
好吧，染色。

77
So it's pronounced exactly the same way you know, to die, to not live anymore.
所以它的发音和你知道的“死”是完全一样的。

78
Dye.
染色。

79
But it's spelled differently.
但拼写不同。

80
D-Y-E.
D-Y-E。

81
Okay, so it can be a verb or an adjective.
好吧，所以它可以是动词或形容词。

82
Or a noun.
或名词。

83
Or a noun.
或名词。

84
So something that you put on clothes to change the color is called a dye.
所以你放在衣服上以改变颜色的东西叫做染料。

85
A dye.
染料。

86
But to do this, to change the color of some clothes is to dye the clothes.
但要做到这一点，改变一些衣服的颜色就是染衣服。

87
So that's maybe what happens when you wash a red t-shirt with all your white t-shirts.
所以这可能就是当你把一件红色T恤和所有白色T恤一起洗时发生的事情。

88
Then you have dyed shirts, you have pink shirts, and... And also women, when they go to the beauty salon, they dye their hair.
然后你就有了染色的衬衫，你有了粉色的衬衫，还有……而且女性去美容院时，她们染头发。

89
Exactly, so that means you change the color of your hair.
确实如此，这意味着你改变了头发的颜色。

90
It means it's a long-term change.
这意味着这是一个长期的变化。

91
It's not short.
这不是短期的。

92
It's not like one day.
这不是一天的事。

93
Right.
对。

94
It means probably for a long time.
这意味着可能会持续很长时间。

95
So that's the correct word, to dye.
所以这是正确的词，染色。

96
Very different.
非常不同。

97
Maybe some people say to paint.
也许有些人会说涂色。

98
Which, you know, we understand, but the correct form would be to dye.
我们理解，但正确的形式应该是染色。

99
And next we have a word that describes a certain kind of clothing.
接下来我们有一个描述某种衣物的词。

100
We're not talking about pants or socks.
我们不是在谈裤子或袜子。

101
We're talking about delicates.
我们在谈精致品。

102
Delicates.
精致品。

103
So now this adjective delicate, which means it's very... Easy to break.
所以现在这个形容词“精致”，意思是非常……容易破碎。

104
Fragile, right?
脆弱，对吧？

105
But this is a noun.
但这是一个名词。

106
Delicates.
精致品。

107
Right, so you think of something that's easy to break or to ruin, maybe you think of underwear.
对，所以你想到的是容易破碎或毁坏的东西，也许你会想到内衣。

108
Underwear.
内衣。

109
You know, underwear is something you wear under your clothing, and so it's generally not as strong as a shirt or a pair of jeans.
你知道，内衣是你穿在衣服下面的东西，所以通常不如衬衫或牛仔裤结实。

110
And so we call these in English, delicates.
所以我们在英语中称这些为精致品。

111
Very good.
非常好。

112
So you have to be careful when you're washing your delicates, because it's happened to me before, you like put them in with all the clothes and then you have stretched out boxers or something like that.
所以在洗涤精致品时你必须小心，因为我之前就发生过这样的事，你把它们和所有衣物一起洗，然后你就得到了拉伸的内裤或类似的东西。

113
Yeah, so that's why many women, I know, wash delicates by hand.
是的，所以我知道很多女性手洗精致品。

114
So you separate the clothes from the delicates.
所以你要把衣物和精致品分开。

115
Very good.
非常好。

116
And now if you're washing delicates or you're washing towels or t-shirts, it's always a good idea to use fabric softener.
现在如果你在洗精致品或毛巾或T恤，使用柔顺剂总是个好主意。

117
All right, fabric softener.
好的，柔顺剂。

118
What are these two words?
这两个词是什么？

119
One of them you understand already, maybe it's soft softener.
其中一个你已经理解了，也许是柔软的柔顺剂。

120
So it makes it soft.
所以它使其变得柔软。

121
Yeah, something that makes something softer.
是的，某种使东西变得更柔软的东西。

122
We've got fabric softener.
我们有柔顺剂。

123
That's something that makes the clothes that you wash softer.
这是一种使你洗的衣物变得更柔软的东西。

124
So fabric is any type of material, right?
所以“面料”是任何类型的材料，对吧？

125
Like a textile.
像纺织品。

126
Yeah, so it could be cotton or silk or nylon, linen.
是的，所以它可以是棉、丝绸、尼龙、亚麻。

127
So these are all kinds of fabrics.
所以这些都是各种面料。

128
So you pour a little bit of this in your washing machine and your clothes come out really nice and soft.
所以你在洗衣机里倒一点这个，你的衣物就会变得非常好和柔软。

129
It feels nice just talking about it.
仅仅谈论它就感觉很好。

130
All right, and well, also to wash your clothes, to actually make them clean, you use detergent.
好的，此外，要洗净你的衣物，实际上使它们干净，你需要使用洗涤剂。

131
Right, so many people might want to say the word soap because soap is what we use to wash our hands and our dishes.
对，所以很多人可能想说“肥皂”这个词，因为肥皂是我们用来洗手和洗碗的。

132
But here we have detergent.
但这里我们有洗涤剂。

133
So this is a special soap for your clothes.
所以这是专门用于衣物的肥皂。

134
Right, laundry detergent.
对，洗衣粉。

135
Yeah, you could just say laundry.
是的，你可以直接说洗衣。

136
You could say laundry detergent or simply detergent.
你可以说洗衣粉或简单地说洗涤剂。

137
And now in order to remove those nasty stains that maybe are very hard, you would use a chemical called bleach.
现在为了去除那些可能非常难去掉的污渍，你会使用一种叫做漂白剂的化学物质。

138
All right, so bleach is the dangerous chemical because it smells very strong.
好的，所以漂白剂是一种危险的化学物质，因为它的味道非常浓烈。

139
Right.
对。

140
And it can change the color of your clothes to white or yellow.
它可以把你的衣物颜色变成白色或黄色。

141
So we usually only use bleach with white clothes.
所以我们通常只在白色衣物上使用漂白剂。

142
I actually had a friend who changed the color of his hair to white using bleach.
我实际上有一个朋友用漂白剂把他的头发染成白色。

143
He put bleach on his head and on his hair and it just turned white.
他把漂白剂涂在头上和头发上，它就变成了白色。

144
Oh wow, so many people do that because they want to go from dark colors to light colors.
哦，哇，很多人这样做，因为他们想从深色变成浅色。

145
And in that case, you wouldn't say, you could say that he dyed his hair white, but usually you would say he bleached his hair.
在这种情况下，你不会说，你可以说他把头发染成白色，但通常你会说他漂白了头发。

146
It's so we understand that it turned white.
这样我们就明白它变成了白色。

147
Exactly.
正是如此。

148
So those five words we just looked at in language takeaway, they're important.
所以我们刚刚在语言学习中看到的那五个词，它们很重要。

149
They're related to doing laundry.
它们与洗衣有关。

150
So before we move on, let's listen to our dialogue again, but a little bit slower.

151

281
And so normally when I was in, well, at least when I was in college, I would take all of my laundry in a bag and I'd throw it in the washing machine and I put it on cold, you know, because cold water, it's okay for all colors, but hot water makes the colors bleed.
所以通常当我在，嗯，至少在大学时，我会把所有的脏衣服放在一个袋子里，扔进洗衣机，设置为冷水，你知道，因为冷水对所有颜色都可以，但热水会让颜色褪色。
