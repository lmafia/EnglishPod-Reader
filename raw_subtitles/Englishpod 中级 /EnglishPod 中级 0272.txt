Today we want to get a nanny, a nanny.
今天我们想找一个保姆，一个保姆。

6
A nanny.
保姆。

So a nanny is a person, usually a woman, but it can be a man as well, I guess.

8
And this person takes care of your children when you're working or when you're out of the house.
这个人会在你工作或外出时照顾你的孩子。

14
Sorry, I can't.
对不起，我不能。

15
I have to go to work, pick up Jake and Maddie from school and make them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.
我得去工作，接Jake和Maddie放学，然后给他们做下午点心，再带Jake去踢足球训练，Maddie去舞蹈课。

16
You sound exhausted.
你听起来很累。

17
Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out.

18
She can pick the kids up and take them to their after school activities.

19
She can also help you do some household chores and run some errands.
她还可以帮你做一些家务和跑腿。

20
Oh, I don't know.
哦，我不知道。

21
It's hard to find the right nanny.
找到合适的保姆很难。

22
You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids.
你必须考虑她的工作经验、你给她的责任，以及她与孩子的互动。

23
I would love to have someone to help me out, though.
不过我很想有个人来帮我。

24
I think you should definitely consider it.
我认为你应该考虑一下。

25
This way, you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you'll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings.
这样你就不必应付如此繁忙的日程，晚上仍然可以和孩子们在一起。

26
I can refer you to this great nanny, Amy.
我可以推荐一个很棒的保姆，Amy。

27
She used to work for my neighbors before they moved away.
她以前为我的邻居工作，直到他们搬走。

28
She's very responsible, a good cook, and great with kids.

Can you give me her number?
你能给我她的电话号码吗？

32
I'll talk it over with Julie and give her a call tomorrow.
我会和Julie讨论一下，明天给她打电话。

33
Maybe this way, I won't be so tired every day, and Julie and I might even get to go on a date once in a while.
也许这样我每天就不会那么累，Julie和我甚至可以偶尔约会。

34
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at some key words on language takeaway.
好的，我们回来了，现在让我们看看一些语言要点。

35
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

36
So as you said, Marco, we don't just find a nanny, we hire a nanny.
正如你所说的，Marco，我们不仅仅是找一个保姆，我们是雇一个保姆。

37
So what does the word hire mean?
那么“雇”这个词是什么意思呢？

38
Okay, so we have the verb to hire someone, and that means to get someone to work for you, and you pay them, obviously, money in exchange for their services.
好的，我们有动词“雇某人”，这意味着让某人为你工作，显然，你要支付他们报酬。

39
Okay, so this is different from finding a job for someone, because I could find a job for someone, but maybe that job is at a restaurant.
好的，这与为某人找工作不同，因为我可以为某人找工作，但那份工作可能是在餐馆。

40
But when I hire someone, that means I want that person to work for me or for my company.
但当我雇某人时，这意味着我希望那个人为我或我的公司工作。

41
That's right.
没错。

42
So in this case, obviously, we are not a company.
所以在这种情况下，显然我们不是公司。

43
We are just a couple of people who are looking for a nanny, so we need to hire a nanny.
我们只是几个人在找保姆，所以我们需要雇一个保姆。

44
We need to get her to work for us, and obviously you will pay her a salary.
我们需要让她为我们工作，显然你会支付她工资。

45
All right, so when you pay her a salary, you also have some expectations about what the nanny will do.
好的，所以当你支付她工资时，你也会对保姆的工作有一些期望。

46
So one of those expectations is that the nanny will take the children to their after-school activities.
其中一个期望是保姆会带孩子去课外活动。

47
That's right, so this is a phrase, if you will, or a type of thing that happens after school.
没错，所以这是一个短语，或者说是课后发生的事情。

48
So usually children, when they finish their classes, they have some things that they can do at school, like, for example, sports.
通常孩子们在上完课后，会有一些可以在学校做的事情，比如运动。

49
That's right.
没错。

50
So this is very common in America, but not so common in other parts of the world.
这在美国很常见，但在世界其他地方不太常见。

51
So just to explain, if your child is in high school or middle school, after school is over, there's no more class, your child might want to play soccer or to go to art class.
解释一下，如果你的孩子在高中或初中，放学后没有课，孩子可能想踢足球或去上美术课。

52
And these are things that you do at the school, but it's usually considered an activity, not a class.
这些是在学校进行的活动，但通常被视为活动，而不是课程。

53
And so we call these after-school activities.
所以我们称这些为课外活动。

54
That's right, so these activities are usually for recreation.
没错，这些活动通常是为了娱乐。

55
They're not really part of the curriculum.
它们并不是真正的课程。

56
It's not a class.
这不是一门课。

57
No, you don't get marks or grades for these.
不，你不会为这些活动打分或评分。

58
These are just for fun, you know.
这些只是为了好玩，你知道的。

59
A lot of people work, and so they need to have these activities for their kids to stay at school until they finish working.
很多人工作，所以他们需要这些活动让孩子们在学校待到他们工作结束。

60
That's right.
没错。

61
Okay, so we want the nanny to take the children or pick them up from their after-school activities, and we also need the nanny to help out with some household chores.
好的，所以我们希望保姆接孩子们或从课外活动中接他们回家，我们还需要保姆帮忙做一些家务。

62
Okay, so you should know where these chores are being done.
好的，所以你应该知道这些家务是在哪里做的。

63
The first word is household, which means in the house.
第一个词是“家务”，意思是在家里。

64
Okay, so examples of household chores would be like cleaning the windows, washing the dishes, or doing laundry.
好的，家务的例子包括清洁窗户、洗碗或洗衣服。

65
So basically any type of cleaning around the house.
所以基本上是任何类型的家庭清洁。

66
That's right, making the house look nicer.
没错，让房子看起来更好。

67
And so usually children have chores.
通常孩子们也有家务。

68
These are things they need to do, but a nanny can also help with household chores.
这些是他们需要做的事情，但保姆也可以帮助做家务。

69
Okay, and also we want the nanny to help and run some errands.
好的，我们还希望保姆帮忙跑一些腿。

70
Okay, so this is funny.
好的，这很有趣。

71
This phrasal verb, this phrase uses the word to run, but we're not running like, you know, a sport.
这个短语动词使用了“跑”这个词，但我们不是在运动中跑。

72
Right.
对。

73
We're going to do some errands, but the verb here is to run errands.
我们要做一些跑腿，但这里的动词是“跑腿”。

74
So, you know, Marco, on Sunday I have to run some errands.
所以，你知道，Marco，星期天我得跑一些腿。

75
I'm sorry I can't go out to the movie with you guys.
对不起，我不能和你们去看电影。

76
Okay, so to run errands, what does that mean?
好的，那么“跑腿”是什么意思呢？

77
Well, an errand is like a job or a task that you have to do, but it's usually not something you get paid for.
嗯，跑腿是你必须做的工作或任务，但通常不是你会得到报酬的事情。

78
Okay.
好的。

79
To run an errand is like to go to the grocery store and pick up food or, you know, oh, to pick up your clothes at the laundromat.
跑腿就像去杂货店买食物，或者去自助洗衣店取衣服。

80
You know, you have dry cleaning.
你知道，你有干洗。

81
Okay, so they're kind of like chores, I guess, but you don't really do them in the house.
好的，所以它们有点像家务，我想，但你不是真的在家里做这些。

82
You have to go outside and run these errands.
你必须出去跑这些腿。

83
You have to go pay your bills, for example.
你必须去支付账单，例如。

84
Exactly, and so, you know, when I was growing up on the weekends my mother would always run all of her errands, because during the week she had to work.
正是如此，所以，你知道，当我长大的时候，周末我母亲总是要跑她的所有腿，因为在工作日她必须工作。

85
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

86
So a lot of interesting words there.
所以有很多有趣的词。

87
I think we can go ahead and listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.
我想我们可以再听一次对话，稍后再回来进行流利度训练。

All right, we're back with Fluency Builder, and so let's take a look at some of these phrases now.
好的，我们回到流利表达训练，现在来看看这些短语。

110
Fluency Builder.
流利表达训练。

111
So this first phrase is a very kind of spoken English phrase, something that you're going to hear all the time, especially if you're talking to your American friends.
第一个短语是非常口语化的英语表达，尤其是和美国朋友交谈时你会经常听到。

112
We say, Are you up for some tennis today?
我们会说，你今天想打网球吗？

113
To be up for... Okay, so to be up for something.
想打... 好的，想打某事。

114
This is from the very first sentence when Grace says, Hey Mel, are you up for some tennis today?
这是格雷斯说的第一句话，嘿梅尔，你今天想打网球吗？

115
What does it mean if I ask someone if they are up for some tennis?
如果我问某人他们想打网球，这是什么意思？

116
This means would you like to play tennis today?

117

118
So is this a good idea for you?
这对你来说是个好主意吗？

119
Do you want to do this?

120
So basically, are you willing to play tennis today?
基本上，就是你愿意今天打网球吗？

121
Yes.

122
All right, so to be up for is to be interested in or willing to do something.
好的，所以想打就是对某事感兴趣或愿意做某事。

123
Are you up for a movie tonight?
你今晚想看电影吗？

124
Okay, or maybe you can ask your friend, Are you up for grabbing a bite to eat later on?
好的，或者你可以问你的朋友，你想稍后去吃点东西吗？

125
Absolutely, I'm hungry.
当然，我饿了。

126
So to be up for is a good way to ask a question.
所以想打是一个很好的提问方式。

127
After that, though, we have another phrase.
不过之后，我们有另一个短语。

128
This phrase is very important when you're trying to get someone to help you.
这个短语在你想让某人帮忙时非常重要。

129
So how do we ask, Can you help me?
那么我们怎么问，能帮我吗？

130
In the dialogue, we saw how Mel said that it would be a great idea to get a nanny because she would love to have someone to help me out.
在对话中，我们看到梅尔说请保姆是个好主意，因为她希望有个人来帮她。

131
So to help someone out, to help me out.
所以帮助某人，帮我。

132
So this is interesting because you could say, I need someone to help me, but it's more common to hear the phrase to help me out.
这很有趣，因为你可以说，我需要有人来帮我，但更常听到的短语是帮我。

133
So you're not going out.
所以你不出去。

134
It doesn't have to do with space.
这和空间无关。

135
But we just say this phrase to help out means to help someone.
但我们只说这个短语，帮助意味着帮助某人。

136
So it's basically the exact same thing, but it just sounds a lot more natural.
所以基本上是完全一样的，但听起来更自然。

137
Exactly.
确切地说。

138
So, you know, Marco, I'm moving tomorrow.
所以，你知道，马尔科，我明天要搬家。

139
Do you have some time to help me out?
你有时间帮我吗？

140
Okay, so you say help me out, but you could also say, Do you have time to help me?
好的，所以你说帮我，但你也可以说，你有时间帮我吗？

141
And both are okay.
两者都可以。

142
Or if I'm talking about me and my friend, you know, we're really busy tomorrow.
或者如果我在谈论我和我的朋友，你知道，我们明天真的很忙。

143
Do you have any time to help us out?
你有时间帮我们吗？

144
Okay, so we just changed the person there.
好的，所以我们只是改变了人称。

145
We went to the plural form.
我们变成了复数形式。

146
Yes, me, us, you.
是的，我，我们，你。

147
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

148
Okay, and so for our last phrase, this is actually also very interesting when Grace was telling Mel that she's really busy and if she gets a nanny, she wouldn't have to juggle such a busy schedule.
好的，对于我们的最后一个短语，这实际上也很有趣，当格雷斯告诉梅尔她真的很忙，如果她请保姆，她就不必应付如此繁忙的日程。

149
All right, so the key verb here is to juggle.
好的，所以这里的关键动词是应付。

150
Now, I wish I could show this to you guys, but as this is an audio podcast, I can't.
现在，我希望我能给你们展示这个，但由于这是一个音频播客，我不能。

151
What does the verb to juggle mean, Marco?
马尔科，动词应付是什么意思？

152
Well, I don't know if you've ever seen clowns or at a circus where people have three balls and they throw them in the air with two hands and they're basically throwing stuff in the air, sometimes balls or pins and stuff like that.
嗯，我不知道你是否见过小丑或马戏团里的人，他们有三个球，用两只手把它们抛向空中，基本上是在空中抛东西，有时是球或棍子之类的。

153
Sometimes fire.
有时是火。

154
Fire.
火。

155
So that's to juggle, basically to have many things in your hands and be able to move them at the same time.
所以这就是应付，基本上是手里有很多东西，并且能够同时移动它们。

156
All right, so when you're talking about a busy schedule, this means that you have lots and lots of things to do.
好的，所以当你谈论繁忙的日程时，这意味着你有很多事情要做。

157
It's important to be able to juggle your busy schedule.
能够应付繁忙的日程是很重要的。

158
That means to to handle doing many things at the same time.
这意味着同时处理很多事情。

159
That's right.
没错。

160
All right, so another way to say this is because you're, you know, you're so busy right now, having a nanny will help you complete your tasks or, you know, finish what you need to do.
好的，所以另一种说法是因为你现在很忙，请保姆会帮助你完成任务，或者完成你需要做的事情。

161
That's right.
没错。

162
So you can also say the CEO of the company has to juggle a very busy schedule.

好的，他有很多事情要做。

也许这样我每天就不会那么累。

188
And Julie and I might even get to go on a date once in a while.
而且朱莉和我甚至可以偶尔约会。

189
So there are a lot of people all over the world who have nannies.
所以全世界有很多人都有保姆。

190
I often see them when I go to New York City.
我在纽约市时经常看到他们。

191
You know, women who take out the kids and they push them in strollers and mom and dad maybe go to work or have classes or something.
你知道，带着孩子的女人，她们推着婴儿车，爸爸妈妈可能去工作或上课之类的。

192
That's right.
没错。

193
Now, this is interesting because there's also another word called a babysitter, but it's different, right?
现在，这很有趣，因为还有一个词叫保姆，但它是不同的，对吧？

194
There's a difference between a nanny and a babysitter.
保姆和保姆之间是有区别的。

195
They both take care of kids, but I think it's the time that they do it that's the difference.
她们都照顾孩子，但我认为时间是区别所在。

196
That's right.
没错。

197
So a nanny is usually hired on a contract basis.
所以保姆通常是按合同雇佣的。

198
You say, I need a nanny to come and watch my kids every day, Monday to Friday, for the next six months.
你会说，我需要一个保姆每天来照看我的孩子，从周一到周五，持续六个月。

199
But with a babysitter, you say, hey, my husband and I, we want to go to watch a movie on Friday.
但对于保姆，你会说，嘿，我和我丈夫想在周五去看电影。

200
Can you come for two hours?
你能来两个小时吗？

201
Okay.
好的。

202
All right.
好的。

203
So a nanny is long term.
所以保姆是长期的。

204
It's someone who maybe lives with you, someone who does some work at your house, someone who cleans the dishes and watches the kids.
她可能和你住在一起，做一些家务，洗碗和照看孩子。

205
But a babysitter just comes, you know, once a month or just when you need her.
但保姆只是偶尔来，比如每月一次或你需要她的时候。

206
That's right.
对的。

207
Okay.
好的。

208
So that's the main difference between a nanny and a babysitter.
所以这就是保姆和保育员之间的主要区别。

209
Now, as you said, they're very, very common nowadays because I guess it's not like before when women usually would stay at home and take care of the children.
现在，正如你所说的，她们在现代非常普遍，因为我想这不像以前，女性通常会待在家里照顾孩子。

210
Now, both parents usually work and so more and more people are getting nannies.
现在，父母通常都在工作，所以越来越多的人雇佣保姆。

211
That's right.
对的。

212
Although nannies can be very expensive, it depends where you live.
虽然保姆可能非常昂贵，但这取决于你住的地方。

213
And so for people who can't afford a nanny, you know, if a nanny is too expensive, the child, the baby will go to daycare.
所以对于那些负担不起保姆的人，如果保姆太贵，孩子就会去托儿所。

214
And that's actually like a place where many babies or children are together and there's, you know, one teacher or one nanny who takes care of everyone.
这实际上是一个地方，许多婴儿或儿童在一起，有一个老师或保姆照顾大家。

215
That's right.
对的。

216
So it's an interesting topic.
所以这是一个有趣的话题。

217
Maybe some of our listeners grew up with a nanny or have a nanny or had a nanny when they were growing up.
也许我们的一些听众是和保姆一起长大的，或者现在有保姆，或者在成长过程中有过保姆。

218
Or maybe you have kids of your own and you have a nanny now.
或者你自己有孩子，现在有保姆。

219
Yeah, let us know.
是的，告诉我们。

220
