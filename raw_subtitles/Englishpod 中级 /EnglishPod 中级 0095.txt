And today we have a very special lesson because we're going to be focusing a little bit more on grammar.
今天我们有一节非常特别的课，因为我们将更多地关注语法。

6
That's right.
没错。

7
We're going to look today at the difference between past simple and past progressive, or sometimes called past continuous.
今天我们要看过去简单时和过去进行时之间的区别，有时也称为过去持续时。

8
Exactly.
正是如此。

9
So we are going to take a look at these two structures, which are a little bit confusing at times, and we're going to be practicing today.
所以我们将看看这两种结构，有时会有点混淆，我们今天会进行练习。

10
But before we get started, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

11
Well, this dialogue is all about telling a story in the past.

12
And we're going to hear two words in the dialogue that we need to understand the meaning of.

So Okay, so if I tell you, I haven't seen you in ages.
好的，如果我告诉你，我好久没见到你了。

14
Basically, you haven't seen me in a really long time.

15
Okay, so it's a way of exaggerating a little bit.
好吧，这是一种夸张的说法。

16
Yes.

17
And this word, ages, we can use in many different ways.
这个词，"ages"，我们可以用很多不同的方式。

18
Like, I've been studying English for ages.
比如，我学习英语已经很久了。

19
Or for example, I can say, I haven't been to the dentist in ages.

20
Oh, well, guess you better go, huh?

Now another phrase, to run into somebody.
现在另一个短语，"碰见某人"。

68
So when I lose it, do I just get angry, angry or upset or even sad?
