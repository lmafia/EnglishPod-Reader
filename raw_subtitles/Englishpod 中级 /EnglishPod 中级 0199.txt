50
And so, maybe the Red Cross office near you will have blood banks and blood donations, but really, they help people, they provide aid to people who are unhealthy or sick or have been in a war.

In the dialogue, the two people are discussing real emergencies.

56
It's a person.
这是一个职业，对吧？

57
It's a profession, right?
成为急救人员。

58
To be a paramedic.
正确，但这并不是真正的医生。

59
Exactly, but it's not really a doctor.

60
So, what's the difference here?
那么，这里有什么区别？

61
So, paramedics are something like nurses.
所以，急救人员有点像护士。

62
Right?
对吧？

63
That travel in an ambulance and get to an emergency or get to the scene of an accident and help out a person.
他们在救护车上旅行，赶到紧急情况或事故现场，帮助人。

64
So, they immobilize the person, they give them oxygen, they make sure that they stay alive until they reach the hospital.

65
Okay, so a paramedic, you might hear the word medic, it's the same thing.
好的，所以急救人员，你可能会听到“医务人员”这个词，它是一样的。

66
A paramedic is like a nurse.
急救人员就像护士。

67
They're not a doctor, but they're usually the first person to help when there's been an accident or a disaster.
他们不是医生，但通常是事故或灾难发生时第一个提供帮助的人。

68
Right, exactly.
对，完全正确。

69
So, if there is an earthquake and many people are stuck in the buildings, usually paramedics will be the ones on the scene trying to get them out and helping them by applying first aid.
所以，如果发生地震，很多人被困在建筑物里，通常急救人员会是现场试图救出他们并通过施行急救来帮助他们的人。

70
Great.

71
Well, after that, we have finally some of the injuries that a paramedic might see.

77
And actually, it's very common, I think, right?
实际上，我认为这很常见，对吧？

78
If you fall and you hit your head.
如果你摔倒并撞到头。

79
That's right.
没错。

80
So, a concussion is really when your brain hits your skull.
所以，脑震荡实际上是你的大脑撞击你的颅骨。

81
That's the bone that protects your brain.
颅骨是保护你大脑的骨头。

82
So, really, you're hitting your head really, really hard.
所以，实际上，你是非常非常用力地撞击你的头。

83
And usually, this can have some bad side effects, like you lose your memory or you're a little bit confused.
通常，这可能会有一些不良副作用，比如失去记忆或有点困惑。

84
It's very common with football players.

Yeah, yeah, with any contact sport, if people suffer concussions, and it's just like, imagine when you have a DVD player and you hit it, and the disc skips or it goes back.
是的，是的，在任何接触性运动中，如果人们遭受脑震荡，就像想象一下，当你有一个DVD播放器并且你撞到它，光盘跳过或回退。

86

87
So, you can suffer memory loss.
所以，你可能会遭受记忆丧失。

88
You can even lose your sight temporarily.
你甚至可能暂时失去视力。

89
That's right.
没错。

90
So, this can be very serious and obviously should be looked at by a paramedic.
所以，这可能非常严重，显然应该由急救人员来检查。

91
We also have another situation that is similarly serious.
我们还有另一种情况同样严重。

92

98
This is the more medical term.
这是更医学的术语。

99
But, of course, there are different ways to break something.
当然，骨折有不同的方式。

100
And so, in medicine, we have a compound fracture.
所以，在医学上，我们有复合骨折。

101
So, a compound fracture is pretty painful and it's a little bit more serious.
所以，复合骨折非常疼痛，而且有点严重。

102
You have a simple fracture, which is when your bone just breaks.
你还有简单骨折，就是骨头直接断了。

103
Or a hairline, which means that there's a little thin part where it's broken but it's not really serious.
或者是发际线骨折，意味着有一小部分骨头断了，但并不严重。

104
In this case, your bones actually push towards each other.
在这种情况下，你的骨头实际上是相互推挤的。

105
They kind of form like a little mountain, right?
它们有点像小山一样，对吧？

106
Or they're on top of each other.
或者它们叠在一起。

107
Think about when two cars hit and they kind of crash up into each other.
想象一下两辆车相撞，它们互相撞击。

108
Exactly.
正是如此。

109
It's like that, but it's your bone.

Yeah, yeah.
是的，是的。

112
It's very, very painful.

121
Well, some people, when they see blood, they feel very, very uncomfortable or sick.
嗯，有些人看到血时会感到非常不舒服或恶心。

122
And so, to faint is to fall down on the ground.
所以，晕倒就是倒在地上。
