My name is Marco.

5
And today we've got a very, very useful lesson for all of you out there.
今天我们为大家准备了一节非常有用的课程。

6
That's right.
没错。

7
We're bringing you part two of the what-if series, which is a small series.
我们带来的是假设系列的第二部分，这是一个小系列。

8
Small.
小。

9
And it is kind of grammar-focused, but it's very, very important because you often want to talk about things that don't happen.
它有点以语法为中心，但非常重要，因为你常常想谈论那些没有发生的事情。

10
We're calling these hypotheticals or conditional statements.
我们称这些为假设或条件句。

11
Right.
对。

12
So there are many different types of hypotheticals or conditional statements.
所以有许多不同类型的假设或条件句。

13
So today we're going to be looking at the third conditional, which is probably the hardest one because it uses a little bit of a complex grammar structure.
今天我们将讨论第三条件句，这可能是最难的，因为它使用了一些复杂的语法结构。

14
It's complex, and we're actually talking about things that did not happen and that will not happen, right?
这很复杂，我们实际上在谈论那些没有发生和将不会发生的事情，对吗？

15
It's impossible to change.
这是不可能改变的。

16
It's impossible to change these because there are things that would have happened in the past but didn't.
这是不可能改变的，因为有些事情本该在过去发生，但没有发生。

17
Wow, that sounds confusing.
哇，这听起来很混乱。

18
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the first time and then we'll be back to look at some phrases first.
我们先听一次对话，然后再回来看一些短语。

19
This is the good life.

20
We have it good, don't you think?

What do you mean?

Like, for example, if I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to.
比如说，如果我没有学习建筑，我就会成为我想成为的艺术家。

27
I see.

28
Yeah, now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally.
是的，现在想想，如果我没有搬到这个城镇并遇到Sally，我就不会结婚。

29
You see, everything happens for a reason.

30
We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago.

Alright, so, before we start in the grammar, why don't we take a look at a couple of different phrases on Fluency Builder.

39
Well, Marco, this first phrase is a phrase you'll hear very often in English.
嗯，Marco，这个短语在英语中你会经常听到。

40
It's a phrase that even has philosophical roots, something we talked a lot about when we were studying Socrates back in school, but this is the good life.
这是一个甚至有哲学根源的短语，我们在学校学习苏格拉底时谈论过很多，但这是美好的生活。

41
The good life.

42
We have the good life, or I have a good life.

43
I have a good life is a very common phrase, but here the good life is an idiom.

44
So, I'm living the good life means, you know, I have no complaints about my life.

97
I'll drink to that.

98
All right, so now it's time for grammar breakdown.
好吧，现在是语法分析的时间。

99
So in grammar breakdown, we're going to look at the two main parts of these phrases that allow us to talk about things that didn't happen.
在语法分析中，我们将查看这些短语的两个主要部分，使我们能够谈论没有发生的事情。

100
So we're talking about looking back at our life and seeing what decisions and what actions we made.
所以我们在回顾我们的生活，看看我们做出的决定和行动。

101
And in this case, we have a great sentence here.
在这种情况下，我们有一个很好的句子。

102
If I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist.
如果我没有学习建筑，我会成为一名艺术家。

103
All right.
好的。

104
So let's look at the first part before the comma.
那么我们先看逗号前的部分。

105
If I hadn't studied architecture.
如果我没有学习建筑。

106
So now we have the conditional if.
现在我们有了条件句“如果”。

107
So Marco, big question.
所以Marco，大问题。

108
Did he study architecture?
他学习建筑了吗？

109
He did.
学习了。

110
He did.
学习了。

111
So if I hadn't studied architecture, it means I did study architecture.
所以如果我没有学习建筑，这意味着我确实学习了建筑。

112
But if I had not studied it, okay, so this is if I could change the past, then what would I have done?
但如果我没有学习它，好吧，这就是如果我能改变过去，我会做什么？

113
I would have become an artist.
我会成为一名艺术家。

114
Okay, so he wanted to be an artist, but he didn't become an artist.
好吧，所以他想成为一名艺术家，但他没有成为艺术家。

115
He studied architecture instead.
他选择了学习建筑。

116
Okay, so you can see the two parts here.
好吧，你可以看到这里的两个部分。

117
We have one, the condition, if I hadn't done this thing.
我们有一个条件，如果我没有做这件事。

118
And then afterwards, we have the result, then I would have become an artist.
然后之后，我们有结果，那么我会成为一名艺术家。

119
So this is the hypothetical.
所以这是假设的。

120
Very good.
非常好。

121
And when we see the condition, you see the structure of the sentence is had plus verb in past participle.
当我们看到条件时，你会看到句子的结构是“had”加上过去分词。

122
So if I hadn't studied architecture, and this is called the past perfect, right?
所以如果我没有学习建筑，这被称为过去完成时，对吗？

123
And then the result, as you said, would have become, this is the present perfect.
然后结果，正如你所说，会成为，这是现在完成时。

124
Have or has plus verb in past participle.
“Have”或“has”加上过去分词。

125
Let's look at another example.
让我们看另一个例子。

126
Okay,
好的，

127
so we've got the same idea here, but we've got it flipped.
所以我们在这里有相同的想法，但我们把它翻转了。

128
We've got these two parts in different places.
我们把这两个部分放在不同的位置。

129
And so he's pretty much saying, if I hadn't moved to this town, then I wouldn't have gotten married.
所以他基本上在说，如果我没有搬到这个城镇，我就不会结婚。

130
But what did happen?
但发生了什么？

131
He did move to this town, and he did get married.
他确实搬到了这个城镇，并且结婚了。

132
So then, yeah, like you say, he changed the condition, and you can do this.
所以，正如你所说，他改变了条件，你可以这样做。

133
You can put the condition in the beginning or at the end.
你可以把条件放在开头或结尾。

134
And again, the structure is the same.
结构是一样的。

135
I would have gotten married, right?
我会结婚，对吧？

136
Have gotten, this is present perfect.
“Have gotten”，这是现在完成时。

137
Have or has, depending on the subject, plus the verb in past participle.
“Have”或“has”，取决于主语，加上过去分词。

138
And then the past perfect or the condition had, plus verb in past participle.
然后是过去完成时或条件“had”加上过去分词。

139
Hadn't moved to this town.
“Hadn't moved to this town”。

140
That's a lot of grammar.
这有很多语法。

141
It's a lot of grammar, but it's very easy once you just start using it.
这有很多语法，但一旦你开始使用它，就会很简单。

142
Don't think too much about, okay, what do I do here?
不要想太多，好的，我该怎么做？

143
Just, you know, if you get the rhythm and you start using it in the same way, then it kind of comes out naturally.
只要你掌握节奏，开始以相同的方式使用它，那么它就会自然而然地出来。

144
And if you make a little mistake, there's not a big deal because even we do it, you know?
如果你犯了小错误，也没关系，因为我们也会这样做，你知道吗？

145
Exactly.
正是如此。

146
Well, let's try a couple of examples off the top of our heads.
好吧，让我们试几个例子。

147
First of all, if I hadn't moved to China, I wouldn't have learned Chinese.
首先，如果我没有搬到中国，我就不会学中文。

148
Very good.
非常好。

149
So you did move to China and you did learn Chinese.
所以你确实搬到了中国，并且学会了中文。

150
So your turn.
轮到你了。

151
All right.
好的。

152
If my parents hadn't spoken Spanish to me when I was a kid, I wouldn't have become fluent in Spanish.
如果我父母在我小时候没有对我说西班牙语，我就不会流利地说西班牙语。

153
Okay.
好的。

154
So your parents did speak Spanish to you and you did become fluent in Spanish.
所以你父母确实对你说西班牙语，你也确实流利地说西班牙语。

155
So not bad.
所以不错。

156
Right.
对。

157
As you can see, you can use it not only to think about things in the past that you can't change anymore, but just also, you know, kind of remember or say, you know, oh, if this hadn't happened, the result.
如你所见，你不仅可以用它来思考过去无法改变的事情，还可以记住或说，哦，如果这没有发生，结果会怎样。

158
Or if I hadn't opened my big mouth, my best friend wouldn't have gotten so angry at me.
或者如果我没有说错话，我最好的朋友就不会对我这么生气。

159
Exactly.
正是如此。

160
So I said something stupid and my friend did get angry and now I feel bad about it.
所以我说了些愚蠢的话，我的朋友确实生气了，现在我对此感到不好。

161
It happens.
这很常见。

162
All right.
好吧。

163
Very good.
非常好。

164
So I hope it's clear.
所以我希望这很清楚。

165
It does sound a little bit complicated, but this is what our website is for, right?
听起来有点复杂，但这就是我们网站的目的，对吗？

166
So if you have questions or doubts or you want to try and plant your own ideas, you can come to the website and do it.
所以如果你有问题或疑虑，或者想尝试提出自己的想法，你可以来网站上做。

167
Want to make some of your own sentences and practice some of these new things, then come to our website, post some comments.
