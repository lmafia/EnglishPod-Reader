8
But we're here talking about men's shoes specifically.
但我们今天专门讨论男鞋。

9
That's right, we've actually decided to talk about this topic, buying shoes separately between men and women's shoes because I think each type of shoe has its own type of vocab and that can be very useful for men or women.
没错，我们决定分别讨论男鞋和女鞋，因为我认为每种鞋子都有其特定的词汇，这对男士或女士都很有用。

10
That's right.
没错。

11
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk more about the specifics of men's shoe styles.

So, as you saw, we have a lot of different shoe styles and so we're gonna take a look at these on Language Takeaway.
如你所见，我们有很多不同的鞋款，所以我们将在Language Takeaway中看看这些。

44
Language Takeaway.
Language Takeaway。

45
Okay, first up, we have a very popular style of shoe.
好的，首先，我们有一种非常受欢迎的鞋款。

46
This is called an athletic shoe.
这叫做运动鞋。

47
Okay, athletic shoe.
好的，运动鞋。

48
Now, I imagine that athletes wear these shoes.
我想运动员会穿这种鞋。

49
Good guess, Marco.
好猜，Marco。

50
So, athletic athletes.
所以，运动员。

51
This is actually for sports in general.
这实际上是指一般的运动。

52
So, this is sports shoes, but in English we say athletic shoes.
所以，这就是运动鞋，但在英语中我们称之为运动鞋。

53
Okay, so it's not specifically for any type of sport, but they're just comfortable shoes that you can do most sports in.
好的，所以它并不特指任何一种运动，而是你可以进行大多数运动的舒适鞋。

54
Right, like running shoes and basketball shoes and soccer shoes.
对，比如跑鞋、篮球鞋和足球鞋。

55
These are all kinds of athletic shoes.
这些都是各种运动鞋。

56
Very good.
非常好。

57
Okay, so these types of athletic shoes, they're usually... they're kind of low, right?
好的，这些运动鞋通常是... 它们有点低，对吧？

58
They don't have a lot of support around the ankle.
它们在脚踝周围没有太多支撑。

59
No, but they do have a lot of support in the heel, the bottom of your foot.
不过它们在脚跟和脚底有很多支撑。

60
Right, because you're running, you need that extra support.
对，因为你在跑步，你需要额外的支撑。

61
Exactly.
正是如此。

62
Now, on the opposite, if you're going hiking, if you're maybe trekking, then you need a special type of shoe that's gonna give more ankle support and these are called hiking boots.
现在，相反，如果你去远足，或者徒步旅行，你需要一种特殊的鞋子，能够提供更多的脚踝支撑，这种鞋叫做登山靴。

63
Okay, hiking boots.
好的，登山靴。

64
So, like you were saying, you get a lot of support in your ankle, that's the back of your foot and the area around your leg.
就像你说的，你在脚踝得到很多支撑，那是脚的后面和腿周围的区域。

65
So, these shoes tend to come higher on your leg.
所以，这些鞋子通常在腿部更高。

66
They're taller on your leg and they're usually pretty heavy.
它们在腿部更高，通常也比较重。

67
Yeah, yeah, and I think they are more weather resistant.
是的，我认为它们更耐天气。

68
So, if it rains or if it's wet, these shoes will respond better.
所以，如果下雨或潮湿，这些鞋子会表现得更好。

69
You're not gonna get wet feet.
你不会弄湿脚。

70
You're not, yeah.
不会的，是的。

71
And so, hiking boots.
所以，登山靴。

72
And now, we have another interesting word.
现在，我们有另一个有趣的词。

73
I never really understood why they're called this way, but we have sneakers.
我从来不明白为什么它们叫这个，但我们有运动鞋。

74
Sneakers.
运动鞋。

75
Okay, I love sneakers.
好的，我喜欢运动鞋。

76
I always wear sneakers.
我总是穿运动鞋。

77
A very common brand that you see with sneakers is Puma.
运动鞋中非常常见的品牌是Puma。

78
Mm-hmm.
嗯嗯。

79
Also Adidas.
还有Adidas。

80
Right.
对。

81
So, Converse is another brand.
所以，Converse是另一个品牌。

82
Sneakers are shoes that are not fancy.
运动鞋是那些不华丽的鞋。

83
They're not like leather or work shoes, but they're also not athletic shoes because you don't necessarily use them when you're playing sports.
它们不像皮鞋或工作鞋，但也不是运动鞋，因为你不一定在运动时穿它们。

84
They're basically very simple shoes for, you know, normal daily stuff.
它们基本上是非常简单的鞋，适合日常穿着。

85
Normal walking.
正常走路。

86
Young people wear them, usually.
年轻人通常穿它们。

87
Okay, sneakers.
好的，运动鞋。

88
Now, I never understood why they're called sneakers because I think if you sneak maybe on someone, I guess these shoes are good for sneaking up.
现在，我从来不明白为什么它们叫运动鞋，因为我觉得如果你偷偷接近某人，我想这些鞋子适合悄悄接近。

89
Perhaps.
也许吧。

90
I don't know.
我不知道。

91
They're less noisy than other shoes.
它们比其他鞋子更安静。

92
Yeah, that's right.
是的，没错。

93
Okay, so we have sneakers.
好的，所以我们有运动鞋。

94
And now, another type of shoe that can be a little bit confusing, they're called tennis shoes.
现在，还有另一种鞋子可能有点混淆，它们叫做网球鞋。

95
Okay, tennis shoes can be considered a kind of sneaker.
好的，网球鞋可以被视为一种运动鞋。

96
Again, it's not the kind of shoe that you would normally wear to work.
再次强调，这不是你通常会穿去工作的鞋。

97
It's not leather.
它不是皮鞋。

98
It's not a hiking boot.
也不是登山靴。

99
They're low shoes, so low ankles, generally.
它们是低帮鞋，通常是低脚踝的。

100
And they have, they tie up, you know.
而且它们是系带的，你知道的。

101
Right.
对。

102
But it's, you would think that you use these shoes to play tennis.
但你会认为这些鞋子是用来打网球的。

103
Not necessarily.
不一定。

104
But not necessarily, right?
但不一定，对吧？

105
I mean, you don't have to play tennis.
我的意思是，你不必打网球。

106
Oh, they're not specifically designed to play tennis.
哦，它们并不是专门设计用来打网球的。

107
Now, perhaps originally they were tennis shoes for the game tennis, but nowadays they're very, very common.
现在，也许最初它们是为打网球而设计的鞋子，但现在它们非常普遍。

108
They're like sneakers.
它们就像运动鞋。

109
Right.
对。

110
They're shoes that most young people wear to school or to play around in.
这是大多数年轻人上学或玩耍时穿的鞋子。

111
Okay, so they're kind of a, yeah, like you say, a sneaker.
好吧，所以它们有点像，你说的，运动鞋。

112
And now moving on, these might seem a little bit strange, but we call them Chuck Taylors.
现在继续，这些可能看起来有点奇怪，但我们称它们为查克·泰勒。

113
Chuck Taylors?
查克·泰勒？

114
Well, basically Chuck Taylor is a brand.
嗯，基本上查克·泰勒是一个品牌。

115
Okay.
好的。

116
Converse Chuck Taylors.
匡威查克·泰勒。

117
We also call them Chucks.
我们也称它们为查克。

118
And this is a style of shoe that this brand made very famous.
这是这个品牌非常著名的一种鞋款。

119
They're very, very thin canvas shoes.
它们是非常薄的帆布鞋。

120
So the fabric is not leather, it's canvas.
所以面料不是皮革，而是帆布。

121
Okay.
好的。

122
And they come in bright red or black or green.
它们有鲜红色、黑色或绿色。

123
Yeah.
是的。

124
And some of them are very low and some of them have a ankle, a piece of the ankle that comes up.
有些非常低，有些则有一段脚踝的部分。

125
So it almost looks like a, like a, like a boot to a certain extent, but it's not like a hiking boot.
所以它看起来几乎像靴子，但并不是登山靴。

126
It's not very hard.
它并不很硬。

127
It doesn't support your ankle as much as just the style is higher.
它对脚踝的支撑没有那么多，只是样式更高。

128
Exactly.
正是如此。

129
And so because these are made of fabric, they're very thin, they're very light.
因为这些是用面料制成的，所以它们非常薄，非常轻。

130
They're not very good for hiking, for example.
例如，它们并不适合远足。

131
Right.
对。

132
So these are called Chuck Taylors.
所以这些被称为查克·泰勒。

133
They're very, very popular with teenagers, right?
它们在青少年中非常受欢迎，对吧？

134
That's right.
没错。

135
Teenagers all over the world wear Chuck Taylors.
世界各地的青少年都穿查克·泰勒。

136
And I think they're very old.
我认为它们已经很久了。

137
This style, these Chuck Taylors have been around for like 30 years.
这种风格的查克·泰勒已经存在大约30年了。

138
I think since the 1960s or 70s.
我想自1960年代或70年代以来。

139
But they're still popular.
但它们仍然受欢迎。

140
Yeah.
是的。

141
And they haven't changed.
而且它们没有改变。

142
They haven't changed.
它们没有改变。

143
Right.
对。

144
So these are the five types or styles of shoes that we're going to take a look at.
所以这些是我们要看看五种类型或风格的鞋子。

145
Why don't we move on now to more specific vocab related to the parts of the shoe on Language Takeaway, part two.
现在我们为什么不继续讨论与鞋子部件相关的更具体的词汇，语言要点第二部分。

146
Language Takeaway.
语言要点。

147
Okay, so Jacob is talking to his mother and his mom wants to know, hey, how about these sneakers?
好吧，雅各布正在和他的母亲交谈，他的妈妈想知道，嘿，这些运动鞋怎么样？

148
What do you think?
你觉得怎么样？

149
And Jacob says, Mom, they've got Velcro.
雅各布说，妈妈，它们有魔术贴。

150
Okay.
好的。

151
So Marco, what's this Velcro Jacob speaks of?
所以马尔科，雅各布所说的魔术贴是什么？

152
Well, as you can see, Velcro is capitalized, right?
嗯，正如你所看到的，魔术贴是大写的，对吧？

153
And so that means this is a proper noun.
所以这意味着这是一个专有名词。

154
And it's actually a brand.
它实际上是一个品牌。

155
Okay, it's like Chuck Taylors.
好的，就像查克·泰勒。

156
Like Chuck Taylors.
像查克·泰勒。

157
So Velcro is supposed kind of like a like a zipper, right?
所以魔术贴有点像拉链，对吧？

158
A fastener, but instead of zipping it up, you just put two pieces of cloth together and they stick.
一种扣件，但不是拉上，而是把两块布放在一起，它们就粘在一起。

159
Okay, and when you pull them apart, they make that sound.
好的，当你把它们分开时，它们会发出那种声音。

160
Yeah, they make a loud sound.
是的，它们会发出很大的声音。

161
And so sometimes with baby shoes or young children's shoes, we don't want to tie them because that's too hard.
所以有时对于婴儿鞋或幼儿鞋，我们不想系鞋带，因为那太难了。

162
So we have Velcro.
所以我们有魔术贴。

163
This is a kind of fabric, like you said, that sticks together.
这是一种布料，正如你所说，能够粘在一起。

164
We don't have to spend all this time tying things.
我们不必花那么多时间系东西。

165
So you see Velcro on hats, on gloves, on jackets, on shoes.
所以你会在帽子、手套、夹克、鞋子上看到魔术贴。

166
It's a very popular way to make things, close things or to keep things secure.
这是一种非常流行的方式来关闭或固定东西。

167
In a very easy way, right?
以一种非常简单的方式，对吧？

168
You just push them together and that's it.
你只需把它们推在一起，就可以了。

169
They're sealed.
它们就密封了。

170
Exactly.
正是如此。

171
So the next time you see it, now you know that it's called Velcro.
所以下次你看到它时，现在你知道它叫魔术贴。

172
I imagine in other languages, it's probably called the same thing.
我想在其他语言中，它可能也叫这个名字。

173
Well, right.
嗯，对。

174
It's the brand name.
这是品牌名称。

175
Yeah.
是的。

176
Yeah.
是的。

177
So, okay.
好吧。

178
And well, now moving on to the parts of the shoe, we have the tongue.
现在继续到鞋子的部件，我们有鞋舌。

179
Okay, well, think about the body part, the tongue, right?
好吧，想想身体部位，舌头，对吧？

180
When you look at your tongue, it's straight and it's flat and it kind of curves at the bottom, right?
当你看着你的舌头时，它是直的、平的，底部有点弯曲，对吧？

181
Well, on a shoe, when you're putting your shoe on, you know, in the front of the shoe can make it stuck, you have to pull the tongue, right?
嗯，在鞋子上，当你穿鞋时，鞋子的前面可能会卡住，你必须拉动鞋舌，对吧？

182
It's a piece of fabric or piece of the shoe where the top of your foot is.
它是鞋子的一块布，位于你脚的顶部。

183
Yeah, very good.
是的，非常好。

184
So that's called the tongue.
所以这叫做鞋舌。

185
Now, some shoes have a very small tongue or low one and other have a very high one.
现在，有些鞋子有非常小的鞋舌或低的鞋舌，而其他鞋子则有非常高的鞋舌。

186
Like, for example, Chuck Taylors, they have a big tongue.
比如说，查克·泰勒，它们有很大的鞋舌。

187
That's right.
没错。

188
Very long tongue.
非常长的鞋舌。

189
And so the tongue is the part that rests on top of your foot.
所以鞋舌是位于你脚顶部的部分。

190
And usually the shoelaces are over the tongue.
通常鞋带在鞋舌上面。

191
Exactly.
正是如此。

192
And now moving on to the bottom part of the shoe, that's called the sole.
现在继续到鞋子的底部，称为鞋底。

193
OK, S-O-L-E, sole.
好的，S-O-L-E，鞋底。

194
This is a really important part of shoes.
这是鞋子中非常重要的部分。

195
I always look at the sole before I buy a pair of shoes because this is the part that you use the most because you're walking on the ground.
我总是在买鞋之前查看鞋底，因为这是你使用最多的部分，因为你在地面上行走。

196
Right.
对。

197
So, for example, hiking boots, they will have a very high sole and they will have kind of like a pattern so that you don't slip if you're walking on dirt, right?
例如，登山靴，它们会有非常高的鞋底，并且会有一种图案，以便你在走在泥土上时不会滑倒，对吧？

198
That's right.
没错。

199
Sometimes rubber, a rubber sole.
有时是橡胶鞋底。

200
But other times like Chuck Taylors also have a rubber sole, but it's very thin.
但有时像查克·泰勒也有橡胶鞋底，但它非常薄。

201
It's very thin.
很薄。

202
And some shoes, for example, they have a plastic sole maybe because they're used for other purposes.
有些鞋子，比如，它们可能有塑料鞋底，因为它们用于其他目的。

203
So they might be a little bit slippery if you go on to a smooth surface.
所以如果你走在光滑的表面上，它们可能会有点滑。

204
Exactly.
正是如此。

205
So the sole, that's the bottom part of the shoe.
鞋底就是鞋子的底部。

206
And the last part of the shoe that we're going to take a look at and probably the most important are the shoe laces.
我们要看的鞋子的最后一个部分，可能是最重要的部分是鞋带。

207
Shoe laces.
鞋带。

208
So shoelaces are basically long pieces of string that you use to tie your shoes closed.
鞋带基本上是用来把鞋子系紧的长绳子。

209
Because you want your shoes to be tight on your foot.
因为你希望鞋子在脚上是紧的。

210
You don't want it to be too loose, otherwise it might fall off.
你不希望它太松，否则可能会掉下来。

211
Right.
对。

212
And Chuck Taylors and some other shoes are very famous for having crazy colored laces or for people using crazy colored laces to tie them up.
Chuck Taylors和其他一些鞋子以其疯狂的彩色鞋带而闻名，或者人们用疯狂的彩色鞋带来系鞋。

213
Right.
对。

214
So that's the part they use to tie or tighten the shoe with.
所以那是用来系或收紧鞋子的部分。

215
So on the opposite, if a shoe doesn't have shoelaces, it's probably going to have velcro.
所以相反，如果一双鞋没有鞋带，它可能会有魔术贴。

216
That's right.
没错。

217
Velcro or shoelaces.
魔术贴或鞋带。

218
Okay.
好的。

219
So those are all the words that we have for you today.
所以今天我们有的词就是这些。

220
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue for the last time.
我们再回去听最后一次对话吧。

221
Hi, I'm looking for a pair of shoes for my son.

238
Would they go with your clothes?

239
The backs are really high and the way the tongue just sticks up.
后面很高，舌头的样子也很突出。

240
They're almost like a boot and the sole doesn't look like it would have a very good grip.
它们几乎像靴子，鞋底看起来抓地力不太好。

241
They're only $45 and they've got cool fluorescent orange shoelaces.
只要45美元，还有酷炫的荧光橙色鞋带。

242

243
Mom!

Okay, try them on.
好吧，试试吧。

245
What size are your feet?
你的鞋码是多少？

246
He's a size nine.

247
We'll try a size 43 on you first and see how that fits.

They come in European sizes.
它们是欧洲码。

250
He should be a size 43.
他应该是43码。

251
I'll be right back.
我马上回来。

252
All right, so talking about shoes, you say that you always take a look at the sole.
好吧，谈到鞋子，你说你总是会看看鞋底。

253
Why is this?
为什么？

254
Because I... I'm always afraid that my shoes are gonna wear out.
因为我... 我总是担心我的鞋子会磨损。

255
And I don't buy shoes very often.
而且我不常买鞋。

256
I love sneakers.
我喜欢运动鞋。

257
I love my pumas and I love flat shoes.
我喜欢我的Pumas和扁平鞋。

258
And so when you buy a pair of shoes you really like, you don't want to buy another pair in six months.
所以当你买一双你真的喜欢的鞋时，你不想在六个月后再买一双。

259
You want to get a pair that has a really good sole so that will last for a long time.
你想要一双鞋底非常好的鞋，这样可以用很长时间。

260
Right, right.
对，对。

261
Yeah, that's true.
是的，没错。

262
I think for me, yeah, that's probably one of the most important parts is the sole as long as it's comfortable.
我觉得对我来说，是的，鞋底可能是最重要的部分，只要它舒适。

263
Because some soles of some shoes can be very rigid.
因为有些鞋子的鞋底可能非常硬。

264
Yeah.
是的。

265
So it's a little bit uncomfortable to walk with.
所以走起来有点不舒服。

266
And, but I don't know, I don't really have that many pairs of shoes if I think about it.
但是，我不知道，我想想我并没有那么多双鞋。

267
Well, most people have one fancy pair of shoes for special occasions.
好吧，大多数人都有一双特别场合穿的鞋。

268
And then a pair of work shoes that are leather.
然后是一双皮鞋用于工作。

269
And then maybe a couple pairs of sneakers and some sandals.
然后可能还有几双运动鞋和一些凉鞋。

270
Sandals.
