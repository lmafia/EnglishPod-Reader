12
Now, what exactly is a newspaper ad, Marco?
Marco，报纸广告到底是什么？

在报纸上，通常有一个叫做分类广告的部分，人们在这里发布广告，可能是出售汽车或寻找雇佣人员。

31
I would pay her hourly.

32
I don't know what the going rate is, though.

I know for sure it's more than minimum wage, but maybe you should just negotiate with the person that answers the ad.

34
Great.
太好了。

35
Thanks for your help.
谢谢你的帮助。

36
All right, we're back.

37
So now let's take a look at language takeaway.
现在让我们看看语言要点。

38
Okay, so first of all, today, Marco, the advertisement is about wanting to hire someone.
好的，首先，Marco，今天的广告是关于想要雇佣某人的。

39
Now, this is an important verb, especially when we're trying to find help.
这是一个重要的动词，尤其是在我们寻找帮助时。

40
The verb to hire.
动词“雇佣”。

41
That's right.
没错。

42
So to hire means to give someone work, to offer a contract to someone.
雇佣意味着给某人工作，向某人提供合同。

43
Okay, so my boss hired me three years ago.
好的，我的老板三年前雇了我。

44
That means he gave me a job three years ago.
这意味着他三年前给了我一份工作。

45
That's right.
没错。

46
But this is not just for office jobs.
但这不仅仅适用于办公室工作。

47
This is for all kinds of jobs.
这适用于各种工作。

48
So what about cutting your grass or doing your lawn?
那么割草或修剪草坪呢？

49
That's right.
没错。

50
So you can hire a gardener, for example.
例如，你可以雇一个园丁。

51
And it's basically the same thing.
基本上是一样的。

52
It means that you're going to pay someone to work for you.
这意味着你将支付某人为你工作。

53
Okay, so today we wanted to hire a maid.
好的，今天我们想雇一个女佣。

54
M-A-I-D.
M-A-I-D。

55
A maid.
一个女佣。

56
But this is a little bit old-fashioned, this word.
但这个词有点过时。

57
What does a maid do?
女佣做什么？

58
Or what did a maid do?
或者女佣曾经做什么？

59
Well, a maid is basically a woman, a female servant, so to say.
嗯，女佣基本上是一个女性仆人。

60
A person that basically serves you.
基本上是一个为你服务的人。

61
All right, so she cleans the house.
好的，她打扫房子。

62
She maybe puts the covers on the beds, washes the dishes, cooks.
她可能会铺床、洗碗、做饭。

63
Does all of these domestic things, so she works around the house.
做所有这些家务，所以她在家里工作。

64
But because there's a bad association, we don't like to think, oh, we have servants.
但因为有不好的联想，我们不喜欢认为我们有仆人。

65
We don't say maid anymore.
我们不再说女佣。

66
We have two other ways of saying this word.
我们有两种其他说法。

67
That's right.
没错。

68
So we could say that we want to hire a cleaning lady, right?
所以我们可以说我们想雇一个清洁工，对吧？

69
Or we want to hire domestic help.
或者我们想雇家务助理。

70
Okay, now there's an important difference between these two words.
好的，现在这两个词之间有一个重要的区别。

71
First of all, cleaning lady is a woman, a lady.
首先，清洁工是一个女性，一个女士。

72
And she is someone who only cleans.
她是专门负责清洁的。

73
She doesn't take care of your children.
她不照顾你的孩子。

74
She doesn't walk your dog.
她不遛你的狗。

75
She basically just cleans the house, washes the dishes, cleans the clothes, washes the floors.
她基本上只打扫房子，洗碗，洗衣服，拖地。

76
So she's a cleaning lady.
所以她是一个清洁工。

77
Now, domestic help.
现在，家务助理。

78
This is a little bit more general.
这更为广泛一些。

79
Right, so domestic help would be a little bit more in-depth of what the person's going to do.
对，所以家务助理会更深入地涉及这个人将要做的事情。

80
So will help with the domestic work.
所以会帮助处理家务。

81
Domestic meaning the house.
家务意味着家庭。

82
So this person will maybe cook for you, clean the house, take care of the kids, do everything that is associated with the house.
所以这个人可能会为你做饭，打扫房子，照顾孩子，做与家庭相关的所有事情。

83
So it's important to see that domestic means something that has to do with the house.
所以重要的是要看到家务意味着与家庭有关的事情。

84
So this is help man or woman in the house.
所以这是在家里帮助的男人或女人。

85
Alright, so that's all we have for Language Takeaway.
好的，这就是我们关于语言要点的全部内容。

86
But we do have another section, Fluency Builder, in which we're going to look at some great words and phrases.
但我们还有另一个部分，流利度提升，在这里我们将看看一些很棒的单词和短语。

87
Alright, so first on Fluency Builder, let's take a look at how we're going to pay the person.
好的，首先在流利度提升中，让我们看看我们将如何支付这个人。

88
Because obviously we were saying that we want to hire this person, we're going to pay them.
因为显然我们在说我们想雇这个人，我们将支付他们。

89
So how are we going to pay them?
那我们将如何支付他们？

90
The person said, I would pay the woman her hourly.
这个人说，我会按小时支付这个女人。

91
I would pay her hourly.
我会按小时支付她。

92
Okay, so this is the rate.
好的，这就是费率。

93
This is how much she will be paid.
这就是她将获得的报酬。

94
And we don't say she will be paid $10,000 per year, we say she will be paid $10 per hour.
我们不说她每年将获得$10,000，而是说她每小时将获得$10。

95
Right.
对。

96
So we pay per hour.
所以我们按小时支付。

97
This is paying her hourly.
这就是按小时支付她。

98
Right, so if you have an hourly wage, that means that you get paid per hour.
对，所以如果你有一个小时工资，那意味着你是按小时支付的。

99
In contrast with a salary, that means that you would get a fixed amount every month.
与薪水相对，那意味着你每个月会获得固定的金额。

100
Alright, so if the monthly salary is $1,000, for example, you could break that down and say, but every day you earn $100, you work 10 days.
好的，所以如果月薪是$1,000，例如，你可以分解说，但每天你赚$100，你工作10天。

101
But if it's hourly, you say you'll get paid $10 per hour.
但如果是按小时计算，你说你会得到每小时10美元。

102
So if you work 4 hours today, you will earn $40.
所以如果你今天工作4小时，你将赚40美元。

103
That's right.
没错。

104
Okay, so now we want to pay the cleaning lady hourly, but we don't know what the going rate is.
好的，现在我们想按小时支付清洁工，但我们不知道当前的收费标准。

105
Going rate.
当前收费标准。

106
Going.
当前。

107
So this is an interesting phrase, and it's important to notice that it's not...
这是一个有趣的短语，重要的是要注意它并不是...

108
going rate is an amount of money, but it's not always the same.
当前收费标准是一个金额，但并不总是相同。

109
Right.
对。

110
It depends on the industry.
这取决于行业。

111
So the going rate for a teacher is different from the going rate for a cleaning lady, which is different from the going rate for a language tutor, or like an English tutor.
所以教师的收费标准与清洁工的收费标准不同，语言辅导员或英语辅导员的收费标准又不同。

112
So, first of all, the going rate is how much these people, these cleaning ladies, normally earn.
首先，当前收费标准是这些人，清洁工，通常赚多少钱。

113
It's an average.
这是一个平均值。

114
Right, so you would usually calculate it, say, the approximate going rate is between maybe $8 to $10 per hour.
对，所以你通常会计算，大约的收费标准在每小时8到10美元之间。

115
So it's not like an exact amount.
所以这不是一个确切的金额。

116
You would say the going rate is more or less a certain amount.
你会说当前收费标准大致是某个金额。

117
It's not exact.
这不是确切的。

118
So you might ask your friends, what do you pay your cleaning lady?
所以你可能会问你的朋友，你给你的清洁工支付多少？

119
And one friend says, oh, I pay $12 per hour.
一位朋友说，哦，我支付每小时12美元。

120
And my other friend says, oh, I pay about $8 per hour.
另一位朋友说，哦，我支付每小时大约8美元。

121
So to me, it sounds like the going rate is about $10 per hour.
所以对我来说，听起来当前收费标准大约是每小时10美元。

122
Right, exactly.
对，正是如此。

123
So we're not really sure what the going rate is.
所以我们并不确定当前收费标准是什么。

124
So our friend says, well, you know what?
所以我们的朋友说，好吧，你知道吗？

125
I'm sure it's more than minimum wage.
我相信这比最低工资要高。

126
Now, minimum wage is actually something that the government decides on or either the federal government in America or the state.
现在，最低工资实际上是由政府决定的，或者是美国的联邦政府或州政府。

127
And each state will have a number that they say that is the least you can pay a person per hour.
每个州都会有一个数字，表示每小时你可以支付给一个人的最低金额。

128
Right, right.
对，对。

129
So it is the law.
所以这是法律。

130
If you pay less... It's illegal.
如果你支付更少... 这是非法的。

131
It's illegal.
这是非法的。

132
And this is because we expect everyone to be treated fairly.
这是因为我们期望每个人都能得到公平对待。

133
Right, right.
对，对。

134
So you don't want to take advantage of people.
所以你不想利用别人。

135
No.
不。

136
And so, for example, in America, in my state, Illinois, I think the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
例如，在美国，在我的州，伊利诺伊州，我认为最低工资是每小时7.25美元。

137
Oh, really?
哦，真的吗？

138
Wow.
哇。

139
It's pretty high.
这很高。

140
And this is because people need to pay for health care and cars and houses and children.
这是因为人们需要支付医疗保健、汽车、房子和孩子的费用。

141
So we say the least you can pay someone is $7.25.
所以我们说你可以支付给某人的最低金额是7.25美元。

142
Now, this is different.
现在，这个是不同的。

143
As you said, it could be different from state to state, right?
正如你所说，这可能因州而异，对吧？

144
Yes.
是的。

145
Because I know in some states, if I'm not mistaken, it's like $5.50 or something.
因为我知道在某些州，如果我没记错的话，可能是5.50美元左右。

146
Yeah, some states it's $5.
是的，有些州是5美元。

147
It depends on the cost of living.
这取决于生活成本。

148
If it's cheap to rent an apartment or to find transportation, then obviously the minimum wage is going to be lower.
如果租公寓或找交通便宜，那么显然最低工资会更低。

149
Obviously, there's no maximum wage.
显然，没有最高工资。

150
There's no number that is the most you can pay someone.
没有一个是你可以支付给某人的最高金额。

151
Right, right.
对，对。

152
But all states have a minimum wage.
但所有州都有最低工资。

153
It's the least that you can pay someone per hour.
这是你每小时可以支付给某人的最低金额。

154
Okay.
好的。

155
And now for our last phrase, we don't know what the minimum wage is.
现在对于我们的最后一句话，我们不知道最低工资是什么。

156
We're not really sure what the going rate is.
我们并不确定当前收费标准是什么。

157
So we should just negotiate with the person that answers the ad.
所以我们应该与回复广告的人谈判。

158
All right, now, to negotiate is a great verb.
好吧，现在，谈判是一个很好的动词。

159
It is something that all of us do all the time.
这是我们所有人一直在做的事情。

160
Right.
对。

161
So to negotiate means to try and compromise.
所以谈判意味着尝试妥协。

162
To reach an agreement.
达成协议。

163
And so maybe I say, the most I will pay is $11.
所以也许我说，我最多支付11美元。

164
So I say, okay, I'll pay you $9.
所以我说，好吧，我支付你9美元。

165
And I say, no, I'll take $12.
我说，不，我要12美元。

166
Yeah, sorry, $12 is too much.
是的，抱歉，12美元太多了。

167
I'll pay you $10.
我支付你10美元。

168
Okay, $11.
好吧，11美元。

169
$11?
11美元？

170
Okay, agreed.
好的，达成协议。

171
Okay.
好的。

172
So it's a way of reaching an agreement, like you say, where both sides have their goals.
所以这是一种达成协议的方式，就像你说的，双方都有他们的目标。

173
And they try to find a price that is the best for both parties.
他们试图找到一个对双方都最好的价格。

174
That's right.
没错。

175
So it's basically a verb to negotiate, and this is what you do, as you said, in many circumstances.
所以这基本上是一个动词，谈判，这就是你在许多情况下所做的。

176
Especially when you're getting a job.
尤其是在你找工作的时候。

177
Yes.
是的。

178
All right, so let's listen to the dialogue one last time, and we'll be back in a bit.
好吧，所以让我们最后再听一遍对话，我们稍后会回来。

179
Can you help me write a newspaper ad?
你能帮我写一则报纸广告吗？

180
Sure.
当然。

181
What are you looking to buy or sell?
你想买或卖什么？

182
Actually, I want to hire someone to help me around the house.
实际上，我想雇人帮我打理家务。

183
Oh, you want to get a maid?
哦，你想找个女佣？

184
Well, I think it's better if you call her a cleaning lady or domestic help.
嗯，我觉得叫她清洁工或家政服务更好。

185
Okay, so what do you want her to do?
好的，那你想让她做什么？

186
Well, let's see.
嗯，让我想想。

187
I want her to come in three times a week for a couple of hours to clean the kitchen, bathroom, and maybe do some cooking.
我想让她每周来三次，待几个小时，清理厨房、浴室，可能还做些饭。

188
Got it.
明白了。

189
And how much do you offer per month?
那你每月提供多少？

190
I would pay her hourly.
我会按小时支付她。

191
I don't know what the going rate is, though.
不过我不知道当前的收费标准是多少。

192
I know for sure it's more than minimum wage, but maybe you should just negotiate with the person that answers the ad.
我确定这比最低工资要高，但也许你应该与回复广告的人谈判。

193
Great.
太好了。

194
Thanks for your help.
谢谢你的帮助。

195
Alright, so talking about minimum wage, is there any exception to why a person would earn less than minimum wage?
好吧，谈到最低工资，有没有什么例外情况，为什么一个人会赚得少于最低工资？

196
I don't believe so.
我不相信有。

197
Well, if they're not legally employed, right?
嗯，如果他们没有合法就业，对吧？

198
So if you're talking about people who we say are under the table, working under the table, that means that they're not working legally.
所以如果你说的是我们所说的“黑工”，在黑市工作，那意味着他们没有合法工作。

199
They're not paying taxes.
他们没有缴税。

200
Then maybe those people will be paid less.
那么也许那些人会得到更少的报酬。

201
What about waiters and waitresses?
服务员和女服务员呢？

202
I've heard that they earn less than minimum wage, but because they earn tips.
我听说他们的收入低于最低工资，但因为他们会有小费。

203
This is true.
这是真的。

204
So most restaurants say, okay, we will pay you as a waiter $3 an hour, but because you will earn tips, you will earn more than the minimum wage.
所以大多数餐馆会说，好吧，我们会支付你每小时3美元的服务员工资，但因为你会赚小费，你的收入会超过最低工资。

205
So this is a good exception.
所以这是一个好的例外。

206
Unfortunately, there's no promise.
不幸的是，没有保证。

207
If you have no customers, you earn no tips, so you're still earning less than minimum wage.
如果你没有顾客，你就赚不到小费，所以你仍然赚得低于最低工资。

208
That's right.
没错。

209
But it's possible that you also have many, many customers, and you earn lots of tips, and you make $15 an hour or something much higher than the minimum wage.
但也有可能你有很多顾客，赚了很多小费，赚到每小时15美元或更高的工资。

210
That's right.
没错。

211
And actually, being a waiter or a waitress is a very common job that a lot of people have when they're still in school or over the summer.
实际上，做服务员是很多人在上学或暑假时常见的工作。

212
And I've heard that it could be quite good because Americans are pretty good tippers.
我听说这可能相当不错，因为美国人通常给小费。

213
That's right.
没错。

214
Americans generally tip between 15 and 20 percent.
美国人一般给15%到20%的小费。

215
And you know that you have to tip because your waiter does not earn a minimum wage.
你知道你必须给小费，因为你的服务员没有最低工资。

216
Right.
对。

217
So you're conscious about that.
所以你对此很有意识。

218
So if your bill comes out to like $100, then you are most definitely going to leave at least a $20 tip.
所以如果你的账单是100美元，那么你肯定会至少留下20美元的小费。

219
Usually, yeah, $15 to $20.
通常是的，15到20美元。

220
$20 if it's that much money.
如果金额这么多，就给20美元。

221
Wow.
哇。

222
Wow.
哇。

223
That's very, very interesting, especially considering that in many countries, tipping is not really considered...
这非常有趣，尤其是考虑到在许多国家，小费并不被认为是...

224
It's not expected or it's not really something that people do.
这不是被期待的，或者人们并不真的这样做。

225
Exactly.
正是如此。

226
And in America, it is something that you have to do.
在美国，这是你必须做的事情。

227
So I think a lot of times when people come to America, they don't expect to pay this.
所以我认为很多人来到美国时，并不期望支付这些。

228
There's tax, there's tip.
有税，还有小费。

229
So when you see a menu, remember that the cost is a lot higher than what you see.
所以当你看到菜单时，记住成本比你看到的要高得多。

230
Exactly.
正是如此。

231
All right.
好的。

232
Very, very interesting topic.
非常有趣的话题。

233
