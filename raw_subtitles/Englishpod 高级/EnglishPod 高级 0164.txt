6
Well, it's an apology letter, but we're going to actually have someone talk it out.

7
Right, so what's happening here is someone is reading a letter they've written, and they're trying to apologize for something.
对，所以这里发生的是某人在读他们写的信，他们试图为某事道歉。

8
And we don't really know what this something is, but I want everyone to really listen here to the words that are being used and to the ways in which we can say sorry, because as they say, there are a thousand ways to say I'm sorry.
我们并不知道这个“某事”是什么，但我希望大家认真听听所用的词汇，以及我们可以如何道歉，因为正如所说，有千种方式说对不起。

12
You came into my life at a time when I needed you the most.
你在我最需要你的时候进入了我的生活。

13
We talked about so many things that I started to realize my heart and my soul could actually feel something other than hurt.
我们谈了很多事情，我开始意识到我的心和灵魂其实可以感受到除了伤痛以外的东西。

14
You placed comfort where there was fear, confidence when there was doubt, a shoulder where tears could fall and completeness where there was emptiness.
你在恐惧中带来了安慰，在怀疑中带来了信心，在泪水可以落下的地方提供了肩膀，在空虚中带来了完整。

15
I wanted to hold on to this so badly that I did whatever it took for you to notice.
我想紧紧抓住这一切，以至于我做了任何事情让你注意到我。

16
What I didn't realize was that I could lose my entire being, all of who I was and all of that I had placed in you.

我想以你应得的方式去爱你，却从未意识到我正在摧毁自己和你。

21
Somehow I needed you to be a part of my life.
不知为何，我需要你成为我生活的一部分。

22
The only problem was that I was willing to jeopardize everything to get that done.

23
All the things that I told you about how I felt and how you make me feel were true.
我告诉你我感受的所有事情，以及你让我感受到的，都是事实。

30
Forgive me, please.
请原谅我。

31
Alright, we're back, so the guy seems to be pretty sad.
好的，我们回来了，这个男孩似乎很伤心。

32
Yeah, this is a very intense... well, it's not a dialogue, it's a monologue.
是的，这是一段非常强烈的……嗯，这不是对话，而是独白。

33
One person is reading it, so it's a very intense monologue.
一个人在朗读，所以这是一个非常强烈的独白。

34
Very romantic.
非常浪漫。

35
Yeah, romantic, but also an air of melancholy.
是的，浪漫，但也带着一丝忧伤。

36
Yeah, that's true.
是的，这是真的。

37
He's kind of like apologizing and at the same time expressing love and all these feelings, so it was very interesting.
他有点像是在道歉，同时表达爱意和所有这些感情，所以这非常有趣。

38
But why don't we take a look at a couple of phrases.
但我们为什么不看看几个短语呢。

39
Now, in advanced media, we're not going to analyze the entire dialogue or, as we do in the other levels, actually pick out items for Language Takeaway or Fluency Builder.
现在，在高级媒体中，我们不会分析整个对话，或者像在其他级别那样，挑选语言要点或流利表达。

40
So in advanced media, we're only going to pick out a couple of words and phrases and just talk about it and talk about the topic in general.
所以在高级媒体中，我们只会挑选几个单词和短语，简单讨论一下，谈谈这个主题。

41
Exactly, and so one of the first phrases that we decided to talk about here is this phrase, I failed you, because this is really the theme of the letter.
没错，所以我们决定讨论的第一个短语是“我辜负了你”，因为这确实是信的主题。

42
Right, so if you fail someone, it means that you let that person down.
对，所以如果你辜负了某人，意味着你让那个人失望。

43
Okay, so you fail someone, I failed you, we can say he failed me.
好的，所以你辜负某人，我辜负了你，我们可以说他辜负了我。

44
So when I really needed that person the most, that person didn't come through or let me down or failed me.
所以当我最需要那个人时，那个人没有出现，或者让我失望，或者辜负了我。

45
All right, so let's give an example.
好吧，让我们举个例子。

46
Maybe I needed my brother to pick me up because I don't have a car and my brother was supposed to pick me up at four o'clock and he forgot he didn't come.
也许我需要我哥哥来接我，因为我没有车，我哥哥本该在四点来接我，但他忘了，没有来。

48
All right, he failed you.
好吧，他辜负了你。

49
Yeah, I was disappointed.
是的，我很失望。

50
Well, that's not as serious as what happened here in this in this letter, I think, right?
嗯，这并没有我在这封信中所发生的事情那么严重，我认为，对吧？

51
I think so, but we could talk about what did happen.
我认为是的，但我们可以谈谈发生了什么。

52
I think I have a theory and I know you have a theory, so we can talk about that in a minute.
我想我有一个理论，我知道你也有一个理论，所以我们可以稍后谈谈。

53
But before that, we have some other phrases about forgiveness and disappointment.
但在此之前，我们还有其他关于宽恕和失望的短语。

54
Right, well, he also said, you mean the world to me and now I come to you asking for forgiveness.
对，他还说，你对我来说意味着整个世界，现在我来请求你的宽恕。

55
Okay, so we've got a positive and a negative.

62

And then I don't, I can't think of what I wanted to say.

And so if a letter helps in that way to get you past your, your fear or your anxiety, then by all means an email is just just as much I actually received a letter, a handwritten letter through an email.
如果一封信能帮助你克服恐惧或焦虑，那么电子邮件也是一样的，我实际上通过电子邮件收到了手写信。

Yeah, that's not good.

As my parents always used to say when I was growing up, and I'd get in fights with my little brother, the only apologies that we accept are the ones that are from the heart.
正如我父母在我成长时常说的，当我和弟弟打架时，我们接受的唯一道歉是发自内心的。

221
So I used to have to apologize again and again and again, until you actually actually meant it.
所以我以前不得不一次又一次地道歉，直到你真的在乎。

222
And so I think that this is a very true kind of idea that that well, maybe not in business and work where you have to be cordial with friends and real relationships with people who you care about.
我认为这是一个非常真实的想法，虽然在商业和工作中你必须与朋友和你关心的人保持礼貌。

223
Obviously, real apologies are very important.

224
Of course.
