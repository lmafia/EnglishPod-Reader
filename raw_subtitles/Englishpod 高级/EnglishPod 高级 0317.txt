Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.
大家好，欢迎来到EnglishPod。

2
My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

3
My name is Katherine, and today we have a very complicated topic for you.
我叫Katherine，今天我们有一个非常复杂的话题要讨论。

4
That's right.
没错。

5
This is an upper intermediate lesson, a little bit more difficult, and we're talking all about taxes, paychecks, and all the information for when you work in the United States.
这是一个中高级课程，稍微有点难，我们将讨论税收、工资单以及在美国工作时的所有信息。

6
That's right.
没错。

7
It confuses me, and I'm American, so take a close listen.
这让我感到困惑，而我还是美国人，所以请仔细听。

8
We're going to listen to this dialogue one time, and we'll be back in a moment to discuss what's going on.
我们将听一次对话，稍后再回来讨论发生了什么。

9
Hey, Susan, have you got a sec?
嘿，Susan，你有时间吗？

10
I have some questions about my paycheck.
我有一些关于我工资单的问题。

11
You bet, Emily.
当然可以，Emily。

12
Pull up a chair.
请坐。

13
Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States, and there are a few things I don't understand.
这是我在美国的第一份工资单，有些地方我不太明白。

14
First off, what is this FICA and SUISDI tax, and why are there deductions both from Medicare and from my health insurance plan?
首先，这个FICA和SUISDI税是什么，为什么从医疗保险和我的健康保险计划中都有扣款？

15
Okay, let's start from the top of your pay stub.
好的，我们从你的工资单顶部开始。

16
This number here represents your gross pay.
这里的数字代表你的总收入。

17
Yes, that's easy enough to understand.
是的，这很容易理解。

18
Then here we have a series of deductions.
然后这里有一系列扣款。

19
First off are the federal ones.
首先是联邦的。

20
FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that.
FICA代表联邦保险贡献法，或者类似的东西。

21
It's your federal income tax.
这是你的联邦所得税。

22
And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you are unable to work.
然后是社会保障和医疗保险，这两个都是联邦项目，帮助你在退休后或无法工作时。

23
All right, I see.
好的，我明白了。

24
So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now.
所以医疗保险实际上不是我现在可以使用的健康保险。

25
That's right.
没错。

26
Below the federal deductions are the state deductions.
在联邦扣款下面是州扣款。

27
There's the state income tax, and then this SUISDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and or disability fund that our state has set up.
有州所得税，然后你问的这个SUISDI税是支付给我们州设立的失业或残疾基金。

28
But you can see that it's a pretty small quantity that they take.
但你可以看到，他们扣的金额相当少。

29
Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that.
是的，我不介意为此给他们一块五。

30
So there are two separate income taxes, one at a state level and one at a federal level.
所以有两个独立的所得税，一个是州级的，一个是联邦级的。

31
That's right.
没错。

32
Not all states have an income tax.
不是所有州都有所得税。

33
Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.
有些州使用更高的财产税或销售税。

34
I see.
我明白了。

35
All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own.
好吧，我想其他的我可以自己弄明白。

36
The deductions for health insurance and my 401k are pretty self-explanatory.
健康保险和我的401k的扣款是相当自明的。

37
Thanks for your help, Susan.
谢谢你的帮助，Susan。

38
No problem.
没问题。

39
All those deductions do add up, and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd feel like.
所有这些扣款加起来，没人净收入会像他们想的那么高。

40
I can understand why you'd want some explanation.
我能理解你想要一些解释的原因。

41
Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK.
是的，我想在英国也是一样。

42
I just never paid much attention.
我只是从来没有太关注。

43
See you later.
再见。

44
All right, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

45
So obviously a lot of vocab there, a lot of acronyms as well like FICA and all that stuff.
显然这里有很多词汇，还有很多缩写，比如FICA等等。

46
We'll take a look at that in a little bit.
我们稍后会看看这些。

47
First, let's start off with some language on language takeaway.
首先，让我们开始一些语言要点。

48
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

49
So when you get paid, there's a very important number you want to look at or a couple of numbers.
所以当你拿到工资时，有一个非常重要的数字你想要查看，或者几个数字。

50
These are called deductions.
这些被称为扣款。

51
Now, why do deductions make people sad, Marco?
现在，为什么扣款让人感到沮丧，Marco？

52
Because a deduction is to take away or reduce.
因为扣款是减少或拿走。

53
So obviously if your salary is, let's say, $1,000 and you have $500 deductions, then you only get five instead of $1,000.
所以显然如果你的工资是1000美元，而你有500美元的扣款，那么你只拿到500，而不是1000。

54
All right, so deductions mean what money is being taken away from you.
好的，所以扣款意味着从你那里拿走了多少钱。

55
All right, that's the money that's deducted for certain taxes or certain programs.
好的，那是为某些税或某些项目扣除的钱。

56
It's important to remember that deduct to deduct is the opposite of to add.
重要的是要记住，扣除是加的反义词。

57
It means to take away.
它意味着拿走。

58
To take away, that's right.
拿走，没错。

59
So Emily had some questions about her salary, and so she brought her pay stub to Susan to ask her, why are all these deductions?
所以Emily对她的工资有一些问题，于是她把工资单带给Susan，问她，为什么有这么多扣款？

60
Why am I not getting all my salary?
为什么我没有拿到全部工资？

61
That's right.
没错。

62
So pay stubs are very important pieces of paper.
所以工资单是非常重要的文件。

63
Basically, when you go to a store and you buy something, you get a receipt.
基本上，当你去商店买东西时，你会得到一张收据。

64
Well, when you go to work and you get paid, you get a receipt for your payment.
好吧，当你去工作并拿到工资时，你会得到一张付款收据。

65
That means that it shows you how much money you earn and all of these deductions.
这意味着它显示了你赚了多少钱和所有这些扣款。

66
So if you're paid every month, you get a paid stub every month.
所以如果你每月领取工资，你每月会收到一张工资单。

67
If you're paid every two weeks, you get a pay stub every two weeks.
如果你每两周领取工资，你每两周会收到一张工资单。

68
Okay, so it's basically a little receipt that tells you you have been paid and how much you were paid.
好的，所以这基本上是一张小收据，告诉你你已经被支付了多少钱。

69
That's right.
没错。

70
All right, so Susan started explaining about her gross salary and her net salary.
好的，所以Susan开始解释她的总工资和净工资。

71
All right, and these are the two most important numbers on your pay stub.
好的，这两个数字是你工资单上最重要的数字。

72
On your pay stub, it will say gross pay.
在你的工资单上，会写总收入。

73
Okay, not gross, like icky gross, but like total.
好的，不是恶心的总，而是总计。

74
So in total, you earn $1,000 a month, but that's not how much money you have in your bank.
所以总的来说，你每月赚1000美元，但这不是你在银行里的钱。

75
Because the money that you earn is actually a little bit different because of these deductions we mentioned.
因为你赚的钱实际上因为我们提到的这些扣款而有所不同。

76
So the net pay is the actual amount of money you get to keep.
所以净收入是你实际可以保留的金额。

77
Right, so the company will pay $1,000, but with taxes and all these deductions, the actual money that you get is less, and that's called the net pay.
对，所以公司会支付1000美元，但扣税和所有这些扣款后，你实际拿到的钱更少，这被称为净收入。

78
So it's important when you're looking at these numbers, look at your gross pay.
所以在查看这些数字时，重要的是查看你的总收入。

79
Is that correct?
这正确吗？

80
And then afterwards, look at your net pay.
然后再查看你的净收入。

81
Is that what money you actually received?
这就是你实际收到的钱吗？

82
That's right.
没错。

83
All right, so now getting into a little bit of taxes and the type of taxes that we have out there, not considering the taxes for the salary, this is a different one.
好的，现在谈谈一些税收和我们所拥有的税种，不考虑工资的税，这是不同的。

84
We have a property tax.
我们有财产税。

85
That's right.
没错。

86
So some places in America tax you on the amount of money you earn at your job, but a lot of others like to collect taxes from different areas, so property tax is one of those.
所以美国的一些地方对你在工作中赚到的钱征税，但很多地方喜欢从不同的领域收税，所以财产税就是其中之一。

87
If you own land, if you own a house or a condo, you will pay a property tax every year.
如果你拥有土地、房子或公寓，你每年都要支付财产税。

88
Every year you have to pay for owning this property.
每年你都要为拥有这块财产付费。

89
That's right, because basically you're paying the state for the land that you have, or the space that you have.
没错，因为基本上你是在为你拥有的土地或空间支付给州的费用。

90
And the bigger your house is, the bigger the land is, the more money you pay.
而且你的房子越大，土地越大，你支付的费用就越多。

91
And you have to pay the same value every year, or does it change over time?
你每年都要支付相同的金额，还是会随着时间变化？

92
It can change over time.
可能会随着时间变化。

93
You hear this sometimes, property taxes are... or property value increases, and so then property tax will probably increase as well.
你有时会听到，财产税...或财产价值增加，所以财产税可能也会增加。

94
Okay.
好的。

95
And what about sales tax?
那销售税呢？

96
I think this is very straightforward, but how does it work?
我觉得这很简单，但它是如何运作的？

97
Well, it's straightforward, Marco, but I don't think they have this in many other places in the world.
嗯，这很简单，Marco，但我认为在世界上许多其他地方没有这个。

98
In China, for example, we don't really have a sales tax, so people don't have to worry about it.
例如在中国，我们实际上没有销售税，所以人们不必担心。

99
But a sales tax is a small tax that you pay every time you buy something.
但销售税是你每次购买东西时支付的小税。

100
Right.
对。

101
All right, if I buy a TV and the TV is $100, it's possible that the sales tax is 3%, I pay $103.
好的，如果我买一台电视，电视价格是100美元，销售税可能是3%，我支付103美元。

102
So that's another way that you are taxed, not on how much money you make, but on the purchases that you make.
所以这就是另一种征税方式，不是根据你赚多少钱，而是根据你购买的东西。

103
It makes sense.
这很有道理。

104
If I buy a lot of cool things, cars, TVs, you know, I'm paying more money to my state to provide services like schools and roads and things like that.
如果我买很多酷东西，比如车、电视，你知道，我支付给州的税款更多，以提供学校、道路等服务。

105
Uh-huh, okay.
嗯，好吧。

106
So a lot of interesting things here.
这里有很多有趣的事情。

107
I think we can move on now to specifically talking about the taxes related to people's salaries or how they... or how it works in the United States.
我想我们可以继续讨论与人们薪水相关的税收，或者它在美国是如何运作的。

108
This is... remember that we are talking specifically about the United States here, so let's take a look at that now on Fluency Builder.
这是... 记住，我们在这里具体讨论美国，所以现在让我们在流利构建器上看看。

109
All right, so one of the scary acronyms here, Marco, was FICA.
好的，Marco，这里有一个可怕的缩写，FICA。

110
The FICA, FICA.
FICA，FICA。

111
It looks very strange here.
这看起来很奇怪。

112
What is this FICA?
这个FICA是什么？

113
Well, this is an acronym.
嗯，这是一个缩写。

114
And remember, acronyms are words that stand for other words.
记住，缩写是代表其他单词的词。

115
So F, federal, I, insurance, C, contribution, and A, act.
所以F，联邦，I，保险，C，贡献，A，法案。

116
So Federal Insurance Contribution Act.
所以是联邦保险贡献法案。

117
Basically, this is a federal tax.
基本上，这是一个联邦税。

118
That means that it's everyone in the country.
这意味着全国每个人都要支付。

119
Everyone has to pay, no matter where you live.
每个人都必须支付，无论你住在哪里。

120
Yeah, Illinois, New York, California, everyone has to pay.
是的，伊利诺伊州、纽约、加利福尼亚，人人都要支付。

121
And how much is this tax, do you know?
这个税是多少，你知道吗？

122
I do not know.
我不知道。

123
It's called a graduated income tax.
这叫做累进所得税。

124
That means that people who earn very little pay very little.
这意味着收入很少的人支付很少。

125
People who earn a lot pay more.
收入很多的人支付更多。

126
Uh -huh, okay.
嗯，好吧。

127
So this is something that everyone has to pay, and that's why it's called federal tax, right?
所以这是每个人都必须支付的，这就是为什么它被称为联邦税，对吗？

128
That's right.
没错。

129
So in America, federal means national, and state means more local for your own state.
所以在美国，联邦意味着国家，州意味着你自己州的地方。

130
Okay.
好的。

131
Now, she is obviously paying the federal tax that everyone has to pay.
现在，她显然在支付每个人都必须支付的联邦税。

132
And what about Medicare?
那么医疗保险呢？

133
All right, so this is not a tax, per se.
好的，这实际上不是税。

134
This is actually a deduction that goes into kind of a fund.
这实际上是进入某种基金的扣除。

135
You know, it's a government program.
你知道，这是一个政府项目。

136
And when you're older, when you're retired, you will receive benefits from the federal government, from the United States government, to get health care.
当你年纪大了，退休时，你将从联邦政府、美国政府那里获得医疗保健的福利。

137
So Medicare is a kind of that is paid for by the US government.
所以医疗保险是由美国政府支付的一种。

138
I see.
我明白了。

139
So when you're older, you don't really have to pay for your hospital bills, then because you worked and contributed to this Medicare fund, then you can go and get treatment.
所以当你年纪大了，你实际上不需要支付医院账单，因为你工作并为这个医疗保险基金贡献了钱，所以你可以去接受治疗。

140
That's right.
没错。

141
Or you pay for part of it, and they pay for part of it.
或者你支付一部分，他们支付一部分。

142
So it depends on the system.
所以这取决于系统。

143
But yes, it's a way to get health care through the government.
但确实，这是通过政府获得医疗保健的一种方式。

144
Okay.
好的。

145
And now our next word is interesting because we've heard about social security before.
现在我们的下一个词很有趣，因为我们之前听说过社会保障。

146
You have the social security card, which is basically your ID or it states also that you are an American.
你有社会保障卡，这基本上是你的身份证，或者它也表明你是美国人。

147
But what is the Social Security Fund now that you are contributing to?
但是你现在所贡献的社会保障基金是什么？

148
Well, basically, this is another government program that is designed to make sure that people are comfortable when they stop working.
嗯，基本上，这是另一个政府项目，旨在确保人们在停止工作时能够过得舒适。

149
Because when you stop working, you don't have any income anymore.
因为当你停止工作时，你就没有收入了。

150
You need money to live.
你需要钱来生活。

151
Right.
对。

152
And so your whole life, you're paying into this fund, and the government will then give you the money back, some money, to basically live off of when you're retired.
所以你一生都在为这个基金支付，政府会把一些钱返还给你，基本上让你在退休时生活。

153
Okay.
好的。

154
And so how long do you actually have to work in order to be eligible for social security?
那么你实际上需要工作多久才能有资格获得社会保障？

155
I believe you have to be 65 to be eligible for social security, but I'm not sure.
我相信你必须65岁才能有资格获得社会保障，但我不确定。

156
It's either 60 or 65.
可能是60岁或65岁。

157
Okay.
好的。

158
I'm not there yet.
我还没到那个年龄。

159
All right.
好的。

160
And actually, another one that's very similar is you have this 401k, which is actually a very interesting name for this tax or fund.
实际上，另一个非常相似的是你有这个401k，这实际上是这个税或基金的一个非常有趣的名称。

161
Yeah, 401k is more of an investment.
是的，401k更像是一种投资。

162
So a 401k is something that you put money into every month or year to access later on when you're retired.
所以401k是你每月或每年投入的钱，以便在退休时可以使用。

163
So again, it's a kind of security for you.
所以这又是一种为你提供保障的方式。

164
If you work every day, every year, for 30 years, 40 years, you want to have some money when you're all done.
如果你每天、每年工作30年、40年，你希望在结束时有一些钱。

165
Right.
对。

166
And this is basically a retirement savings plan.
这基本上是一个退休储蓄计划。

167
So what is the difference between social security and the 401k, or are they the same?
那么社会保障和401k之间有什么区别，还是它们是一样的？

168
I think the difference is where the money goes.
我认为区别在于钱的去向。

169
I'm not 100%.
我不确定。

170
But all of these are like, you have to give the government this money, or can I say, hey, I don't want to... don't worry about me.
但所有这些就像，你必须把这笔钱交给政府，或者我可以说，嘿，我不想... 不用担心我。

171
I don't need social security.
我不需要社会保障。

172
I'm saving all on my own.
我自己在存钱。

173
And can I refuse to pay these taxes?
我可以拒绝支付这些税吗？

174
401k, yes, you can refuse.
401k，可以，你可以拒绝。

175
It's not a tax.
这不是税。

176
It's just something that you can... usually this is not a government program.
这只是你可以... 通常这不是一个政府项目。

177
This is something that the company that you work for will set up for you.
这是你工作公司为你设立的东西。

178
But Medicare and social security, these are things that you have to pay into.
但医疗保险和社会保障，这些是你必须支付的东西。

179
Because even if you're rich and you have all this money, you know there are a lot of people in America that don't have any of this.
因为即使你很富有，拥有很多钱，你知道美国有很多人没有这些。

180
And so we consider it something that we do for each other as much as for ourselves.
所以我们认为这是我们为彼此做的事情，和为我们自己做的事情一样。

181
Because also, you know, Medicare and Medicaid, these are programs that you can also be eligible for.
因为你知道，医疗保险和医疗补助，这些是你也可以有资格获得的项目。

182
Even if you're 25 years old or 30 years old, you're poor, you don't have a job.
即使你25岁或30岁，贫穷，没有工作。

183
So these are social programs.
所以这些是社会项目。

184
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

185
It's very, very interesting.
这非常非常有趣。

186
You see that obviously this is why in movies you see that people make fun of taxes and how much tax in America there is and how you can't escape taxes.
你显然看到这就是为什么在电影中人们会嘲笑税收，以及美国有多少税，以及你无法逃避税收。

187
But it's interesting to see how it's made up and why you are giving your money to the government.
但看到它是如何构成的，以及你为什么把钱交给政府，这很有趣。

188
That's right.
没错。

189
So let's listen to today's dialogue again.
所以让我们再听一遍今天的对话。

190
It was pretty complicated, so hopefully you've understood a little bit more after we've talked about it now.
这相当复杂，所以希望在我们讨论之后你能理解得更多一点。

191
Hey Susan, have you got sick?
嘿，Susan，你生病了吗？

192
I have some questions about my paycheck.
我对我的工资单有一些问题。

193
You bet, Emily.
当然可以，Emily。

194
Pull up a chair.
请坐。

195
Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States, and there are a few things I don't understand.
嗯，这是我在美国的第一张工资单，有一些我不明白的事情。

196
First off, what is this FICA and SUISDI tax?
首先，这个FICA和SUISDI税是什么？

197
And why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan?
为什么医疗保险和我的健康保险计划都有扣除？

198
Okay, let's start from the top of your pay stub.
好的，让我们从你的工资单顶部开始。

199
This number here represents your gross pay.
这里的数字代表你的总工资。

200
Yes, that's easy enough to understand.
是的，这很容易理解。

201
Then here we have a series of deductions.
然后这里有一系列扣除。

202
First off are the federal ones.
首先是联邦扣除。

203
FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act or something like that.
FICA代表联邦保险贡献法案。

204
It's your federal income tax.
这是你的联邦所得税。

205
And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you are unable to work.
然后是社会保障和医疗保险，这两个都是联邦项目，帮助你在退休后或无法工作时。

206
Alright, I see.
好的，我明白了。

207
So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now.
所以医疗保险实际上不是我现在可以使用的健康保险。

208
That's right.
没错。

209
Below the federal deductions are the state deductions.
在联邦扣除下方是州扣除。

210
There's the state income tax, and then this SUISDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and or disability fund that our state has set up.
有州所得税，然后你问的这个SUISDI税是支付给我们州设立的失业或残疾基金。

211
But you can see that it's a pretty small quantity that they take.
但你可以看到，他们扣除的金额相当少。

212
Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that.
是的，我不介意给他们一美元五十。

213
So there are two separate income taxes, one at a state level and one at a federal level.
所以有两个独立的所得税，一个是州级的，一个是联邦级的。

214
That's right.
没错。

215
Not all states have an income tax.
不是所有州都有所得税。

216
Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.
有些州使用更高的财产税或销售税。

217
I see.
我明白了。

218
All right.
好吧。

219
Well, I think everything else I can figure out on my own.
嗯，我想其他的我可以自己弄明白。

220
The deductions for health insurance and my 401k are pretty self-explanatory.
健康保险和我的401k的扣除是相当自明的。

221
Thanks for your help, Susan.
谢谢你的帮助，苏珊。

222
No problem.
没问题。

223
All those deductions do add up and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like.
所有这些扣除加起来，没人能拿到他们想要的净工资。

224
I can understand why you'd want some explanation.
我能理解你想要一些解释的原因。

225
Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK.
是的，我想在英国也是一样。

226
I just never paid much attention.
我只是从来没有太关注。

227
See you later.
再见。

228
All right, so another interesting thought that came up was, well, where does the money for government spending come from?
好吧，另一个有趣的想法是，政府支出的资金来自哪里？

229
So because you have all these taxes that are for you basically, you have property tax or maybe does it come from sales tax that maybe the government can make roads and parks and stuff like this?
所以因为你有这些基本上是为你服务的税收，你有财产税，或者它是否来自销售税，政府可以用来修建道路和公园等？

230
Well, that's the thing.
嗯，这就是问题。

231
Remember earlier we talked about federal and state taxes.
记得我们之前谈过联邦和州税。

232
Well, if it's a state tax like sales tax, you know, in America I can pay sales tax in California, but maybe in New Mexico there is no sales tax.
如果是州税，比如销售税，你知道，在美国我可以在加利福尼亚支付销售税，但在新墨西哥可能没有销售税。

233
So this is a state tax.
所以这是州税。

234
And that means that the state government can use the money for state projects, parks, roads, things like that.
这意味着州政府可以将这些钱用于州项目、公园、道路等。

235
But then the Federal Insurance Contribution Act, the FICA, this federal tax, that is something that's used for our military, our government.
但联邦保险贡献法案，FICA，这个联邦税，是用于我们的军队和政府的。

236
You know, this pays the paychecks of people in Congress, the President.
你知道，这支付国会和总统的薪水。

237
This is where all the money to pay them comes from.
这就是支付他们的所有资金来源。

238
And so basically the state taxes pay for state benefits and programs and the federal taxes pay for these nationwide programs.
所以基本上，州税支付州福利和项目，联邦税支付全国性项目。

239
So that's I think one of the most interesting things about this topic is that the United States is like 50 small countries that kind of have their own little governments.
我认为这个话题最有趣的事情之一是，美国就像50个小国家，各自有自己的小政府。

240
You know, they have their own taxes and they have their own rules like in some states you can start driving when you're 16 and others when you're 15.
你知道，他们有自己的税收和规则，比如在某些州你可以16岁开始驾驶，而在其他州是15岁。

241
And so it's like all these little small countries, but at the same time you have this one mega country that has federal taxes and federal insurance and military and all this.
所以就像这些小国家，但同时你有这个超级国家，有联邦税、联邦保险和军队等等。

242
That's true.
这是真的。

243
And you know, it's interesting.
你知道，这很有趣。

244
It's an interesting fact about American history that the most conflict in our country has really come down to these two groups.
关于美国历史的一个有趣事实是，我们国家的最大冲突实际上归结为这两个群体。

245
One group believes that the federal government, so it's the national government, should have more power than the states.
一组人认为联邦政府，即国家政府，应该比州有更多的权力。

246
And another group believes that the state should have more power.
另一组人认为州应该有更多的权力。

247
And that is a big problem, you know, this disagreement that we've had in America that goes back to 1776 and the founding fathers.
这是一个大问题，你知道，这种分歧在美国已经持续到1776年和开国元勋。

248
And so I don't think it's something that is fixed.
所以我认为这不是一个固定的事情。

249
You know, these things change, you know, sometimes more federal power, sometimes less.
你知道，这些事情会变化，有时更多的联邦权力，有时更少。

250
But it's a very interesting part of American history.
但这是美国历史中非常有趣的一部分。

251
And also it would be interesting to hear from our users how it works over there, because I know that approximately a rough estimate is that around 30 to 40 percent of Americans' income goes to tax, right?
还有，听听我们的用户那边是怎么运作的也很有趣，因为我知道大约粗略估计，约30%到40%的美国人收入用于税收，对吗？

252
About that, yeah.
大约是的。

253
So almost half of your money goes into taxes.
所以几乎一半的钱都用于税收。

254
So I wonder how much it is in other people's countries.
我想知道其他国家的情况如何。

255
Maybe they have 60 percent of taxes, or maybe 10.
也许他们的税收是60%，或者10%。

256
Yeah, so let us know.
是的，所以让我们知道。
