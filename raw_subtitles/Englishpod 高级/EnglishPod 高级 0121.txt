So today we're bringing you another advanced lesson and this time it's kind of historical.

6
Like the name suggests, we are listening in as a president says goodbye to the nation before he steps down from his role as president.
正如名字所示，我们将听一位总统在卸任前向国家告别。

7
Now actually this dialogue is very much based on President Eisenhower's Farewell speech.
实际上，这段对话很大程度上基于艾森豪威尔总统的告别演说。

8
Oh, okay.
哦，好的。

9
So a pretty famous... now we have to tell you that we did change the speech a little bit, right?
这是一个相当著名的演讲……我们必须告诉你，我们确实对演讲做了一些修改，对吧？

10
Yeah, just a little bit.
是的，只是稍微改动了一下。

11
To make it a little bit more understandable, but it's basically what he said to the nation back in 1969.
为了让它更易于理解，但基本上是他在1969年对国家所说的话。

12
Alright now, I will as well tell you that this is a pretty hard dialogue.
好吧，我还要告诉你，这段对话相当难。

13
It is very hard because the structures are a little bit complicated and even to a certain point a little bit poetic, right?
它非常难，因为结构有点复杂，甚至在某种程度上有点诗意，对吧？

14
So why are we taking this speech as our dialogue?
那么我们为什么选择这段演讲作为我们的对话？

15
What are we gonna learn from this?
我们将从中学到什么？

16
Well, we're gonna learn some structures and some words that you can use maybe on a resignation letter or maybe in a celebration you want to thank Pete for coming.
嗯，我们将学习一些结构和一些词汇，你可以在辞职信中使用，或者在庆祝活动中感谢Pete的到来。

17
Okay, so we're gonna learn some pretty difficult vocabulary but also learn some really useful structures.
好的，所以我们将学习一些相当困难的词汇，同时也学习一些非常实用的结构。

18
Like you said you could use a resignation letter or even in a formal speech of your own.
就像你说的，你可以在辞职信中使用，甚至在你自己的正式演讲中。

19
Exactly.
正是如此。

20
Now, this presidential farewell speech is divided into two parts.
现在，这段总统告别演说分为两部分。

21
So today we're gonna do part one and then next time we'll finish the speech with part two.
所以今天我们将进行第一部分，下次我们将完成第二部分。

22
So let's listen to President Eisenhower as he says goodbye to the nation and we'll come back just in a little bit.

My own relations with Congress began on a remote and tenuous basis when, long ago, a member of the Senate appointed me to West Point.
我与国会的关系始于一个遥远而脆弱的基础，早在很久以前，一位参议员任命我去西点军校。

30
I then had the pleasure of building more intimate relationships with Congress during the war and the immediate post-war period.

31
Finally, we have progressed to the mutually interdependent relationship we've had during these past eight years.

32
Wow, so Eisenhower is a pretty good speaker, isn't he?
哇，艾森豪威尔真是个不错的演讲者，不是吗？
