Hello, English learners.
你好，英语学习者。

Welcome back to another podcast here with us at EnglishPod.
欢迎回到我们的英语播客。

My name is Marco.
我叫马尔科。

4
And I'm Erica.
我是艾瑞卡。

5
And today we have an advanced lesson for all of you and a very good one because we're going to be talking about a very serious topic, global warming.
今天我们为大家准备了一节高级课程，非常好，因为我们将讨论一个非常严肃的话题，全球变暖。

6
That's right.
没错。

7
And even though most people agree that global warming is a big problem, there's still this sort of fringe element of people who believe that actually global warming doesn't exist.
尽管大多数人都同意全球变暖是一个大问题，但仍然有一小部分人认为全球变暖实际上并不存在。

8
Exactly.
确实如此。

9
So that's what we're going to be looking at today.
所以今天我们要讨论的就是这个。

10
But before we tell you more or less what the dialogue is about, let's take a look at some words in Vocabulary Preview.
但在告诉你对话大致内容之前，让我们先看看一些词汇预览。

11
We're going to look at two words here, and you'll hear both of these in the dialogue.
我们将看两个词，你将在对话中听到这两个词。

12
So the first one is polar ice caps.
第一个是极地冰盖。

13
Polar ice caps.
极地冰盖。

14
Polar ice caps.
极地冰盖。

15
So when we talk about polar ice caps, polar is... Like the Poles.
当我们谈论极地冰盖时，极地是... 就像极点。

16
The Poles, right?
极点，对吧？

17
The north and south Poles of the Earth.
地球的南北极。

18
Okay, so the extreme... The top and bottom.
好的，所以是极端... 顶部和底部。

19
The top and bottom of the planet.
行星的顶部和底部。

20
Yep.
是的。

21
Okay, and what about ice caps?
好的，冰盖呢？

22
So the polar ice caps are masses of ice that live or that exist on the top and the bottom of the world.
所以极地冰盖是存在于世界顶部和底部的冰块。

23
We have these big chunks of ice that are on the top at the bottom of the planet.
我们在地球的顶部和底部有这些大块冰。

24
Yes, they're there all year round.
是的，它们全年都在那里。

25
Okay, so these are the polar ice caps.
好的，这就是极地冰盖。

26
What about our next word?
下一个词呢？

27
Well, next word is endangered species.
下一个词是濒危物种。

28
An endangered species.
濒危物种。

29
An endangered species.
濒危物种。

30
Okay, so endangered species.
好的，濒危物种。

31
It's a type of animal that is at risk of completely dying out.
是一种面临完全灭绝风险的动物。

32
Okay, so it's not completely extinct.
好的，所以它并不是完全灭绝。

33
Right.
对。

34
So it's in danger.
所以它处于危险中。

35
Okay, in danger of.
好的，处于危险中。

36
Yeah.
是的。

37
So an example of endangered species would be... The Bengal tigers.
所以濒危物种的例子是... 孟加拉虎。

38
Okay, the tigers or the pandas, right?
好的，老虎或熊猫，对吧？

39
Or maybe gorillas.
或者可能是大猩猩。

40
Right, so all of these animals, there are very few of them left in the world, so they are endangered species.
对，所以这些动物在世界上所剩无几，因此它们是濒危物种。

41
Okay, so with that, I think we're just about ready to turn to our dialogue.
好的，基于此，我想我们差不多可以转向我们的对话了。

42
Now here we're gonna learn a lot of language that you can use when you want to make an argument or express your point of view in a very sort of academic way.
现在我们将学习很多语言，你可以在想要提出论点或以学术方式表达观点时使用。

43
But Marco, what are we arguing about here?
但是马尔科，我们在争论什么呢？

44
So we're gonna listen as a college professor is lecturing about global warming and, well, one of the students doesn't really agree with what he's saying.
我们将听一位大学教授讲授全球变暖，而其中一位学生并不完全同意他的观点。

45
And of the early 21st century.
以及21世纪初。

46
Questions?
有问题吗？

47
Yeah, in the lecture you said there's more evidence in the scientific record supporting global cooling?
是的，在讲座中你说科学记录中有更多支持全球变冷的证据？

48
Well, yes.
嗯，是的。

49
Essentially, the historical record supports a theory of climate cycles.
本质上，历史记录支持气候周期理论。

50
Warming and cooling are cooperating processes in the planetary ecosystem.
变暖和变冷是行星生态系统中的相互作用过程。

51
If that's true, and the planet is getting cooler, what explains the rapid melting of the polar ice caps and the dramatic rise in the global average temperatures?
如果这是真的，地球正在变冷，那极地冰盖的快速融化和全球平均温度的急剧上升又该如何解释呢？

52
But are global temperatures rising?
但是全球温度真的在上升吗？

53
If you look at the data from 1975, you'll... You'll be misled.
如果你查看1975年的数据，你会... 你会被误导。

54
If you were serious, you would look at the record starting in the 1880s.
如果你认真，你应该从1880年代开始查看记录。

55
Then you would see how dramatically the Earth's temperature has changed.
然后你会看到地球温度变化的剧烈程度。

56
Young lady, I beg to differ.
小姐，我不同意。

57
Look, the point of the lecture was to emphasize that there's evidence for both sides.
听着，讲座的重点是强调双方都有证据。

58
And I'm putting forth the argument that there's greater evidence in support of the global cooling hypothesis.
我提出的论点是支持全球变冷假说的证据更为充分。

59
Look, it's an indisputable fact that the public is being manipulated and scared into believing that there's some kind of climate crisis.
听着，公众被操控和恐吓，相信存在某种气候危机，这是不争的事实。

60
This scaremongering is done quite simply for political reasons.
这种恐吓行为完全是出于政治原因。

61
But even without the uncomfortable reality that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide contribute to global warming, isn't the topic appropriate for politicians to discuss?
但即使没有温室气体如二氧化碳对全球变暖的影响，这个话题难道不适合政治家讨论吗？

62
Not if they want to use your tax dollars and mine to fund completely unnecessary initiatives.
如果他们想用你的税款和我的税款来资助完全不必要的倡议，那就不适合。

63
Yeah, like conservation, protecting endangered species, and investing in renewable energy.
是的，比如保护濒危物种和投资可再生能源。

64
At the very least, you have to concede that this debate has the potential to end our dependence on foreign oil.
至少，你必须承认这场辩论有可能结束我们对外国石油的依赖。

65
Buying oil supports autocratic countries that use these revenues to devastating ends.

70
Why should we trust your soul called findings more than tobacco institute studies, which say smoking doesn't harm health?
我们为什么要相信你所谓的研究结果，而不是说吸烟对健康无害的烟草研究？

71
You're full of it.
你真是胡说。

72
Some people just cannot handle civil debate.
有些人就是无法进行文明的辩论。

73
All right, so apparently this college professor is not very truthful in what he's saying, right?
好吧，显然这位大学教授在说话时并不诚实，对吧？

74
Well, yeah, maybe he believes it, but they certainly have very strong and differing opinions.
嗯，是的，也许他相信，但他们的观点确实非常强烈且不同。

75
So that's the interesting part is that we heard a lot of language that she used to argue her point of view.
所以有趣的是，我们听到了她用来论证自己观点的很多语言。

76
So this is interesting and we can start now looking at some of this language in language takeaway.

77
Language takeaway.

That's right, so that's our last phrase for Fluency Builder.
没错，这就是我们流利表达的最后一句话。

198
Now, I think it'll help us to understand these words and phrases a little bit better to hear them again in context.
现在，我认为再在上下文中听一遍这些词和短语会帮助我们更好地理解。

所以，提出论点的有趣方式，嗯，这是一个有趣且非常有争议的话题，对吧？

227
That's right.
没错。

但我注意到在这个对话中，学生在提出她的论点和对抗老师时非常坚定。

229
Right, she argued with the teacher a lot.
对，她和老师争论了很多。

230
And this is interesting because it's a very cultural aspect, I think, right?

231
Yeah, in North American universities, there is this idea that it's really important to think critically and to argue against different ideas and to really speak up when you don't agree with something.
是的，在北美大学，有一种观念认为批判性思维和反对不同观点是非常重要的，当你不同意某事时要勇于发声。

232
Right, so basically there's this culture of questioning, not only what you're being taught, but you can also question the teacher.
对，所以基本上有一种质疑的文化，不仅质疑你所学的内容，还可以质疑老师。

233

我认为有一群学术-minded的人，他们觉得问这些非常困难的问题并与教授争论是非常酷的。

238
Yeah, yeah, that's really true.
