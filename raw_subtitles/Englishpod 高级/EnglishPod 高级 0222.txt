Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.
大家好，欢迎来到EnglishPod。

2
My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

3
My name is Katherine.
我叫Katherine。

4
And today's lesson is an advanced level lesson.
今天的课程是高级课程。

5
That means we'll be speaking using our normal English tone of voice and using some very, very difficult vocabulary and phrases.
这意味着我们将使用正常的英语语调，使用一些非常非常困难的词汇和短语。

6
So this is really good practice for all of you out there.
所以这对你们所有人来说都是很好的练习。

7
That's right.
没错。

8
We're going to change a little bit the dynamic of how it works.
我们将稍微改变一下课程的动态。

9
We're not going to look specifically at language takeaway or fluency builder.
我们不会专门关注语言要点或流利度提升。

10
We're going to talk about the topic.
我们将讨论主题。

11
We are going to pick out a couple of different words and phrases that are used in the dialogue.
我们将挑选出对话中使用的几个不同的词汇和短语。

12
But we're mainly going to talk just have a conversation and you can just listen and study a little bit of what we're saying.
但我们主要会进行对话，你们可以听听我们在说什么，稍微学习一下。

13
So what is the topic today, Marco?
那么今天的主题是什么，Marco？

14
Well, today we're going to talk about the environment, specifically about our carbon footprint.
今天我们将讨论环境，特别是我们的碳足迹。

15
Okay, that is the title of today's lesson.
好的，这就是今天课程的标题。

16
I encourage all of you to listen to the context of that phrase and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what it and some of these other phrases mean.
我鼓励大家听听这个短语的上下文，我们稍后会回来讨论它和其他一些短语的意思。

17
So what's your guys take on all this global warming hysteria in the media?
那么你们对媒体上所有的全球变暖歇斯底里有什么看法？

18
It's pretty serious, man.
这很严重，伙计。

19
There have been tons of scientific studies and the scientific community says that the earth is heating up.
有很多科学研究，科学界表示地球正在变暖。

20
We need to make some drastic changes to our lifestyle if we want to preserve our planet.
如果我们想保护我们的星球，我们需要对我们的生活方式做出一些重大改变。

21
I don't know.
我不知道。

22
It sounds like a bunch of mumble jumble if you ask me.
如果你问我，这听起来像一堆胡言乱语。

23
The earth will save itself.
地球会自我拯救。

24
It survived the worst disasters in the past.
它在过去经历了最糟糕的灾难。

25
I mean, honestly, we live in the boonies.
我是说，老实说，我们住在偏远地区。

26
There's no way anyone here is ever going to walk or bike to work, especially in the winter.
这里没有人会在冬天走路或骑自行车上班。

27
And we have no bus system.
而且我们没有公交系统。

28
My house is 40 years old and it would take a lot of money to get it refitted to be green and energy efficient.
我的房子已经40年了，要把它改造成绿色和节能的需要很多钱。

29
Well, I don't really know if I believe in global warming either, or whether or not it was our doing or natural change the earth is going through.
嗯，我也不太确定我是否相信全球变暖，或者这是否是我们造成的，还是地球正在经历的自然变化。

30
But you have to admit that we're living pretty irresponsibly here in the West.
但你必须承认，我们在西方的生活方式相当不负责任。

31
I guess.
我想是的。

32
I think the issue at hand is sustainability.
我认为当前的问题是可持续性。

33
We've only got this one earth we can live on and our resources are quickly disappearing because of our own carelessness and our inability to think of anyone but ourselves and anything but the present.
我们只有这一个地球可以生活，而我们的资源因我们自己的粗心和只考虑自己及当下而迅速消失。

34
So like I was saying, we need to change the way we live.
所以就像我说的，我们需要改变我们的生活方式。

35
We need to reduce our carbon footprint.
我们需要减少我们的碳足迹。

36
But it doesn't have to be that drastic.
但这不必那么极端。

37
Hybrid vehicles and solar panels are too expensive to be feasible right now.
混合动力车和太阳能电池板现在太贵，无法实现。

38
And we don't have to be hippies living off the land and buying everything organic either, though it helps.
我们也不必像嬉皮士一样过着靠土地生活和购买有机产品的生活，尽管这样做是有帮助的。

39
I carpool to work every day with some buddies of mine.
我每天和我的一些朋友拼车上班。

40
I have a rain barrel outside my house I used to water my plants and my lawn in the summer.
我家外面有一个雨水桶，我用它在夏天给我的植物和草坪浇水。

41
And I make sure I always bring reusable bags with me when I get my groceries.
而且我确保每次购物时都带上可重复使用的购物袋。

42
And we just started using biodegradable plastic made from corn oil for takeout orders at my family's restaurant.
我们刚开始在我家餐厅的外卖订单中使用由玉米油制成的可生物降解塑料。

43
Remember the three R's?
还记得三R吗？

44
Reduce, Reduce, Recycle.
减少、再利用、回收。

45
Exactly.
正是。

46
It's just small, simple changes.
这只是一些小而简单的改变。

47
Like buying energy-saving light bulbs, starting a compost bin, recycling bottles and papers, using reusable water bottles, stop using disposable cups and cutlery.
比如购买节能灯泡，开始堆肥，回收瓶子和纸张，使用可重复使用的水瓶，停止使用一次性杯子和餐具。

48
Like the ones we're drinking out of?
就像我们正在喝的这些？

49
Yeah.
是的。

50
Alright, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

51
So as you probably guessed, carbon footprint, it's pretty easy.
所以你们可能猜到了，碳足迹，这很简单。

52
You're talking about a footprint is the evidence you leave if you're walking on sand, for example.
你在谈论的是脚印，比如你在沙子上行走时留下的痕迹。

53
Exactly.
正是。

54
And if we talk about carbon, we're talking about the element, right?
如果我们谈论碳，我们是在谈论元素，对吧？

55
Carbon.
碳。

56
Yep.
是的。

57
So carbon is something that is in everything, basically.
所以碳基本上存在于一切事物中。

58
It's organic, but it can also, in the case of a carbon footprint, mean the amount of maybe waste or damage that we do to the earth or to the environment.
它是有机的，但在碳足迹的情况下，也可以指我们对地球或环境造成的废物或损害的数量。

59
Right.
对。

60
So for example, you're driving your car, we all know that the gas that is emitted from the exhaust pipe is CO2, right?
例如，当你开车时，我们都知道从排气管排放的气体是二氧化碳，对吧？

61
And that contains carbon.
而且那里面含有碳。

62
So that's a way of seeing that you're leaving a footprint of carbon.
所以这是一种看你留下碳足迹的方式。

63
You are damaging the atmosphere a little bit by driving your car.
你在开车时对大气造成了一点损害。

64
So in talking about a carbon footprint, we talk about having a low carbon footprint, which is good, or a very high carbon footprint, which is bad.
所以在谈论碳足迹时，我们谈论的是低碳足迹，这很好，或者非常高的碳足迹，这不好。

65
Right.
对。

66
So there were a lot of interesting things coming up in the dialogue.
所以对话中出现了很多有趣的事情。

67
One of the first things was... Well, the first thing that they're talking about in this dialogue is they're having kind of an argument about whether or not global warming and global climate change really exists.
他们在对话中讨论的第一件事是……好吧，他们在讨论全球变暖和全球气候变化是否真的存在。

68
Yeah, this is a very interesting part because some people say, well, global warming is happening, global warming is real, and other people say, well, it's not real, it's not really a problem, this is just a phase that the earth will go through, and like everything, it'll disappear.
是的，这是一个非常有趣的部分，因为有些人说，全球变暖正在发生，全球变暖是真实的，而其他人则说，这不真实，这不是问题，这只是地球将经历的一个阶段，像所有事物一样，它会消失。

69
Well, I agree with people who say that the earth goes through phases because sometimes there are centuries that are hotter, and sometimes there are centuries that are colder.
嗯，我同意那些说地球经历阶段的人，因为有时有些世纪是更热的，有时有些世纪是更冷的。

70
But I think it's undeniable that there has been a large and immediate global climate change in the last maybe 20 years.
但我认为不可否认的是，在过去的20年里，全球气候变化是显著且迅速的。

71
Yeah, we're definitely speeding up maybe that cycle, right?
是的，我们肯定在加速这个循环，对吧？

72
Exactly.
正是。

73
And I think what's great evidence of this and terrible evidence of this is the three earthquakes, massive earthquakes that have happened in the last couple of months.
我认为最近几个月发生的三次大地震是很好的证据，也是很糟糕的证据。

74
And I think that earthquakes like last year and like this year are really, really important reminders that we do as humans influence the way that the world responds to us.
我认为像去年和今年这样的地震是我们人类影响世界对我们反应方式的重要提醒。

75
I think I always see it as the earth kind of just shaking its back, kind of saying like, get off me.
我总是把它看作是地球在摇晃它的背部，像是在说，别碰我。

76
Stop it.
停止。

77
That itches.
那很痒。

78
Yeah, exactly.
是的，正是。

79
I think that that's kind of the way I see earthquakes sometimes.
我有时就是这样看待地震的。

80
But when they were talking about, well, is it real?
但当他们在讨论，嗯，这是真的吗？

81
Is it not?
不是吗？

82
They use a really interesting phrase and says, it sounds like a bunch of Mumbo jumbo.
他们使用了一个非常有趣的短语，说，听起来像一堆胡言乱语。

83
Mumbo jumbo.
胡言乱语。

84
So this is a way to say that sounds like a bunch of garbage, or it sounds like a bunch of gibberish.
所以这是一种说法，表示听起来像一堆垃圾，或者听起来像一堆无意义的话。

85
It sounds like a bunch of people are talking about something that doesn't really exist.
听起来像一群人在谈论一些并不存在的事情。

86
So Mumbo jumbo is basically something that's not really real, right?
所以胡言乱语基本上是指一些不真实的东西，对吧？

87
True.
对。

88
I think don't you also you can you use it as somebody that's saying something that you don't really understand?
我认为你也可以用它来形容某人说的你不太理解的事情。

89
Right.
对。

90
So if maybe I'm talking to you about something that's very academic and very scholarly, you say, sounds like a bunch of Mumbo jumbo to me.
所以如果我在和你谈论一些非常学术和学术性的事情，你说，听起来对我来说是一堆胡言乱语。

91
Exactly.
正是。

92
Yeah.
是的。

93
So that's what the person said.
所以那就是那个人所说的。

94
Ah, you know, the environmental problems are a bunch of Mumbo jumbo.
啊，你知道，环境问题是一堆胡言乱语。

95
But it was really interesting because they were like, well, we have to save the earth and well, and then there was actually a phrase here that was really kind of hard for me to understand when the person said, I mean, honestly, we live in the boonies.
但这真的很有趣，因为他们说，我们必须拯救地球，然后这里有一句话我真的很难理解，当那个人说，我是说，老实说，我们住在偏远地区。

96
boonies.
偏远地区。

97
So what does it mean by living in the boonies?
那么住在偏远地区是什么意思？

98
This is a very common word to hear in spoken English, especially with young people.
这是一个在口语英语中非常常见的词，尤其是在年轻人中。

99
boonies means we live far away from civilization, we live far away from cities, we live far away from everything.
偏远地区意味着我们住得远离文明，远离城市，远离一切。

100
So maybe these people live in the countryside, or in a small village, and they don't feel like they're affected by what people in the big cities do.
所以也许这些人住在乡村，或者在一个小村庄，他们觉得自己不受大城市人所做事情的影响。

101
Okay.
好的。

102
So if you say, Oh, I live in the boonies, and you're just saying I live really far, really far away.
所以如果你说，哦，我住在偏远地区，你只是说我住得非常远，非常远。

103
So this is a very common American word, I think.
所以我认为这是一个非常常见的美国词。

104
You can also say boondocks, which is like that movie boondock saints.
你也可以说“偏僻地方”，就像那部电影《偏僻地方的圣徒》。

105
But boondocks and boonies means very far away.
但“偏僻地方”和“偏远地区”都意味着非常远。

106
So I could say, Marco, I'm not gonna drive out to your house for a party.
所以我可以说，Marco，我不会开车去你家参加派对。

107
You live in the boonies.
你住在偏远地区。

108
Do you have any other ways that you can say that you live really far away?
你还有其他说法可以表达你住得很远吗？

109
You live in Egypt, you live in Egypt, which for us in America is obviously very, very far away.
你住在埃及，你住在埃及，对我们美国人来说显然是非常非常远。

110
Sometimes we say yanks.
有时我们会说“洋基”。

111
Oh, the yanks.
哦，洋基。

112
Exactly.
正是。

113
Yanks.
洋基。

114
People in New Zealand say that.
新西兰的人会这么说。

115
I've also heard people say, Oh, you live where the wind turns around.
我也听过人们说，哦，你住在风转弯的地方。

116
Really?
真的？

117
Did you hear that one?
你听过那个吗？

118
Yeah, I like that one.
是的，我喜欢那个。

119
You live so far.
你住得太远了。

120
Oh, God, you live where the wind turns around.
哦，天哪，你住在风转弯的地方。

121
The end of the earth.
地球的尽头。

122
Exactly.
正是。

123
Wow.
哇。

124
So well, there are a lot of different ways of saying that.
所以，有很多不同的说法。

125
So they were talking about different aspects of the environment, like that we heard the word green, or energy efficient.
他们在谈论环境的不同方面，比如我们听到的“绿色”或“节能”。

126
Okay, so basically, what they're doing is they're talking about some of the things they've heard in the media, maybe, or on TV, about what people are supposed to be doing, you know, these are very abstract.
好的，基本上，他们在谈论一些他们在媒体上，可能是在电视上听到的事情，关于人们应该做什么，这些都是非常抽象的。

127
That means these are very kind of big terms, go green, or be more energy efficient.
这意味着这些都是非常大的术语，去绿色，或更节能。

128
Yeah, I've heard this, like, for example, when people say, Oh, you have to be more green or go green.
是的，我听过，比如当人们说，哦，你必须更环保或去绿色。

129
That means more friendly towards the ecosystem, right?
这意味着对生态系统更友好，对吧？

130
That's right.
没错。

131
So this is a very general suggestion.
所以这是一个非常一般的建议。

132
And we can talk about specifics in a minute.
我们可以稍后讨论具体的事情。

133
But this is a very general suggestion for thinking about the environment and doing things to help it.
但这是一个关于思考环境和做一些帮助环境的事情的非常一般的建议。

134
And so go green or be green as a way to be more environmentally friendly.
所以去绿色或变得环保是一种更环保的方式。

135
We also have using energy efficient computers or light bulbs or TVs.
我们还可以使用节能的电脑、灯泡或电视。

136
Right.
对。

137
And the third thing that they talk about, and this is something that comes up a lot is sustainability.
他们谈到的第三件事，常常提到的是可持续性。

138
Yeah, that's a big word that a lot of people like to use.
是的，这是一个很多人喜欢使用的大词。

139
Yeah, it is.
是的，确实如此。

140
And in this type of topic, sustainability, right.
在这个主题中，可持续性，对吧。

141
So sustainability comes from the word to sustain, that means to hold out over time or to continue.
所以可持续性来自于“维持”这个词，意味着在时间上持续或继续。

142
So you think about something, maybe sustainability is, I think, in many cases about doing or having habits, doing things that you can continue to do for a long time.
所以你考虑的事情，也许可持续性在很多情况下是关于做或拥有习惯，做一些你可以长期继续做的事情。

143
For example, driving a big SUV to work every day is not keeping in mind sustainability, because one day, there will be no oil.
例如，每天开一辆大型SUV上班并不考虑可持续性，因为总有一天会没有石油。

144
So then what do we do?
那我们该怎么办？

145
Right.
对。

146
So that's not a sustainable action.
所以这不是一个可持续的行为。

147
Sustainable actions mean that we have less impact, negative impact on the world.
可持续的行为意味着我们对世界的负面影响更小。

148
Right.
对。

149
So basically, what you're trying to do is to sustain, which means to to hold to withstand these habits, for example.
所以基本上，你试图做的是维持，这意味着坚持这些习惯，例如。

150
So when you talk about a sustainable ecosystem, it means that it has everything it needs, and it continues, it can continue to work for a very, very long time.
所以当你谈论一个可持续的生态系统时，这意味着它拥有所需的一切，并且可以继续工作很长时间。

151
Right.
对。

152
So you can also talk about sustainable development, which we talked about in in aid and giving aid to other countries.
所以你也可以谈论可持续发展，我们在援助和给予其他国家援助时谈到过。

153
So sustainable development is trying to help other countries or other people in ways that they can keep continue to do for a long time.
所以可持续发展是试图以他们可以长期继续做的方式帮助其他国家或其他人。

154
It's also very popular with tourism.
这在旅游中也非常受欢迎。

155
They talk about sustainable tourism.
他们谈论可持续旅游。

156
Right.
对。

157
That means thinking about the environment and having tourism that can last forever, not tourism that will destroy the environment because it's very harmful.
这意味着考虑环境，并拥有可以永远持续的旅游，而不是会破坏环境的旅游，因为这非常有害。

158
It's a very interesting topic.
这是一个非常有趣的话题。

159
And as you say, it's used in a wide range of cases, sustainable development, sustainable projects, sustainable tourism.
正如你所说，它在广泛的情况下使用，可持续发展、可持续项目、可持续旅游。

160
There are a lot of different ways that people use this, but it's basically the same thing, right?
人们使用这个有很多不同的方式，但基本上是同一件事，对吧？

161
It's in essence, it refers to that.
本质上，它指的就是这个。

162
Yes.
是的。

163
Keeping something going over time.
让某事在时间上持续。

164
But I think the big question here is, if you want to go green, if you want to be environmentally friendly, what do you do?
但我认为这里的大问题是，如果你想去绿色，如果你想环保，你该怎么做？

165
Because it's it's not about big ideas.
因为这不是关于大想法。

166
It's about specifics.
这关乎具体的事情。

167
It's about changing your everyday actions.
这关乎改变你每天的行为。

168
Right.
对。

169
So these guys had a couple of ideas.
所以这些家伙有几个想法。

170
Yeah, they came up with something like, for example, hybrid vehicles, which is a big thing now.
是的，他们想出了像混合动力汽车这样的东西，这现在是个大趋势。

171
Basically, hybrid means two, right?
基本上，混合动力意味着两个，对吧？

172
It's a it's a combination of one of two or more.
这是两个或更多的组合。

173
That's right.
没错。

174
So, you know, the Sphinx in Egypt, that's a hybrid, right?
所以，你知道，埃及的狮身人面像，就是一个混合动力，对吧？

175
Between a man and a lion.
介于人和狮子之间。

176
Exactly right.
正确。

177
So a hybrid vehicle basically uses gasoline, but also electricity.
所以混合动力汽车基本上使用汽油，但也使用电力。

178
So they're very, they're very, actually very, very efficient because they're quiet, they're quiet.
所以它们非常高效，因为它们安静，安静。

179
And usually where you use up most of your gasoline is in traffic, because your car is on, you're accelerating, you're breaking, you're accelerating, you're breaking.
通常你消耗大部分汽油是在交通中，因为你的车在加速、刹车、加速、刹车。

180
So in this case, I think hybrid vehicles run on the electric engine until they hit, I think it's 30 miles per hour.
所以在这种情况下，我认为混合动力汽车在达到30英里每小时之前是用电动机驱动的。

181
Yeah.
是的。

182
And once you surpass that, then it switches to the gas engine, which obviously if you have a constant high speed, it uses, it's more efficient, the combustion of the gasoline.
一旦你超过这个速度，它就切换到汽油发动机，显然如果你保持恒定的高速，它使用汽油的燃烧效率更高。

183
Exactly.
正是。

184
So a good example of a hybrid vehicle is the Toyota Prius.
所以混合动力汽车的一个好例子是丰田普锐斯。

185
Right.
对。

186
I think it was like the first one commercially available.
我认为它是第一个商业可用的。

187
But now they have all kinds and they're actually trying to make entirely electric cars.
但现在他们有各种各样的车型，实际上正在尝试制造完全电动的汽车。

188
So lots of things to watch out for there.
所以有很多事情需要关注。

189
But they also talked about something for the house, right?
但他们也谈到了房子的事情，对吧？

190
So if you want to not just have a nice car that is environmentally friendly, but also to do things with your house, what can you put on your roof?
所以如果你不仅想要一辆环保的好车，还想在家里做一些事情，你可以在屋顶上放什么？

191
I think we've seen a lot of these.
我认为我们见过很多这样的东西。

192
These are called solar panels.
这些被称为太阳能电池板。

193
Okay, solar has to do with the sun.
好的，太阳与太阳有关。

194
So solar power, solar panel, that means energy that comes from the sun.
所以太阳能、太阳能电池板，意味着来自太阳的能量。

195
So the sun and a panel is like a pad or like a some kind of device that can take the energy from the sun.
所以太阳和电池板就像一个垫子或某种设备，可以从太阳获取能量。

196
Yeah, it's really, really good.
是的，真的很好。

197
Basically, you know, in in some places you have anywhere between eight to 12 hours of sunlight.
基本上，你知道，在某些地方，你有8到12小时的阳光。

198
So the whole day, these panels are absorbing energy.
所以整天，这些电池板都在吸收能量。

199
You can store them maybe in batteries and then just use them later.
你可以把它们储存在电池中，然后稍后使用。

200
So basically, you don't really need to use electricity that comes from coal or from nuclear power plants because you want to turn on a light.
所以基本上，你不需要使用来自煤或核电厂的电力来开灯。

201
It doesn't really use up a lot of electricity.
它并不消耗很多电。

202
And there's no waste.
而且没有废物。

203
And there's no waste.
而且没有废物。

204
It's all clean.
一切都是干净的。

205
So my question for you, does Ecuador have a lot of solar panels everywhere?
所以我问你，厄瓜多尔到处都有很多太阳能电池板吗？

206
Because you guys have so much sunlight down there.
因为你们那里有很多阳光。

207
We don't really have a lot of them.
我们并没有很多。

208
It's not a big commercial thing yet.
这还不是一个大规模的商业项目。

209
But there are a lot of projects going around to help implement these things a lot better.
但有很多项目正在进行，以帮助更好地实施这些东西。

210
For example, taking these technologies to the countryside, where people don't have access to electricity by means of cables, right?
例如，把这些技术带到乡村，那里的人们无法通过电缆获得电力，对吧？

211
So they're implementing that they're getting them to use it.
所以他们正在实施，让他们使用它。

212
And but it's still expensive.
但这仍然很贵。

213
That's the problem with solar panels is that, of course, it's an energy efficient way of going, it'll save you money in the long run.
太阳能电池板的问题在于，当然，它是一种节能的方式，从长远来看会为你省钱。

214
But upfront, upfront, you got to spend a lot of money.
但前期，你必须花很多钱。

215
Well, here's a good way to use sustaining.
好吧，这里有一个很好的可持续使用的方法。

216
If someone in the countryside has solar panels in their house, it's a self sustaining way to produce energy.
如果乡村里有人在他们的房子里有太阳能电池板，那就是一种自给自足的能源生产方式。

217
You don't have to depend on another place.
你不必依赖其他地方。

218
Exactly.
正是如此。

219
Yeah, actually, this is a very popular thing in many developed countries.
是的，实际上，这在许多发达国家是非常流行的。

220
I remember when I was living in Chile, big buildings were being marketed as energy efficient and green.
我记得我在智利生活时，大楼被宣传为节能和环保。

221
And by showing that they can be self sustaining.
并且展示它们可以自给自足。

222
So basically, they would have solar panels on the roof, they would collect sunlight all day, and then they had big batteries that would store this energy and then you can use it.
所以基本上，他们的屋顶上有太阳能电池板，全天收集阳光，然后他们有大电池储存这些能量，然后你可以使用它。

223
They were more efficient into keeping heat or keeping the cold.
它们在保持热量或保持寒冷方面更有效。

224
And also what we saw in the vocab that they also had was rain barrels.
