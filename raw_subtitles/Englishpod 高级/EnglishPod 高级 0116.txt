37
Exactly.
正是如此。

38
Well, apparently he's explaining that it wasn't only his fault, right?
显然，他在解释这并不完全是他的错，对吧？

39
Yep.
是的。

40
So some technical problems, but you know, he used a lot of pretty, pretty interesting language.

Alright, so in language takeaway today we have five words and let's start with the first one.

51
You know, Marco, taking my computer without asking is tantamount to stealing.
你知道，Marco，未经允许拿走我的电脑等同于偷窃。

52
Okay, so even though I'm not actually stealing it or taking it home with me, yeah, it is almost like stealing.
好吧，尽管我并没有真正偷走它或把它带回家，但确实几乎像偷窃。

53
Yeah.
是的。

54
And the interesting grammatical thing here is that we almost always use a gerund right after so tantamount to verb ing. Ok, tantamount to stealing, tantamount to lying, tantamount to killing.
有趣的语法是，我们几乎总是在后面使用动名词，所以等同于动词ing。 好吧，等同于偷窃，等同于撒谎，等同于杀人。

55
Ok, well on that happy note, let's go on to our next word.

Now this is common among computers, right?

87
So when you're talking about a glitch and you're talking about computers, it's an error, a mistake.
所以当你谈论故障时，谈论计算机时，它是一个错误，一个失误。

88

So there's a small problem in the story that doesn't make sense.
所以故事中有一个小问题，不合逻辑。

95
Exactly.
正是如此。

96
All right.
好吧。

97
So the employee was blaming his lateness on these small technical glitches, but the boss didn't believe this, right?
所以员工把他的迟到归咎于这些小技术故障，但老板不相信，对吧？

So the boss is saying that he's trying to rationalize.

102
So that means is he trying to make sense of it?
那这意味着他是在试图理解这一切吗？

103
Well, this is an interesting psychological word.

104
And when you rationalize something, you think about it or describe it, like especially some bad behavior in a way that makes it seem better or proper or more sensible.
当你为某事找借口时，你会以某种方式思考或描述它，尤其是一些不良行为，使其看起来更好或更合理。

113
So he was trying to explain to the boss and also kind of make himself believe that it wasn't really his fault when it was.
所以他在试图向老板解释，并让自己相信这并不是他的错，尽管实际上是。

114
Now, because this is a little bit of a difficult concept to understand, I think we should hear some examples.
现在，因为这是一个有点难以理解的概念，我认为我们应该听一些例子。

115
Example one.
例子一。

116
You can't rationalize your son's behavior by saying he's going through a hard time.

123
Alright, in our final words, so the boss really wasn't happy with these excuses.
好吧，在我们最后的话中，老板对这些借口真的不满意。

And he said, no more phony excuses.
他还说，不要再有虚假的借口了。

125
Okay, phony phony p h o n y phony.
好的，虚假，虚假，p h o n y，虚假。

126
So phony is basically false or fake.

127
Right?
对吧？

128
So a phony statement.
所以一个虚假的声明。

129
A phony watch.

130
Okay, a fake watch.
好的，一块假手表。

131
Yeah, not a Sony watch, but a phony.
是的，不是索尼手表，而是虚假的。

132
So a lot of great words in this dialogue.
所以这个对话中有很多很棒的词汇。

133
But as you mentioned, we also saw some very interesting phrases that we can use in situations like this.
但正如你提到的，我们也看到了一些非常有趣的短语，可以在这样的情况下使用。

134
So why don't we start now with fluency builder.
所以我们现在为什么不开始流利度提升呢？

135
Fluency builder.
流利度提升。

136
Well, you know, one of the interesting things about English is that we have a lot of ways to make things sound more direct, less direct, harder or softer.
嗯，你知道，英语中有很多方式让事情听起来更直接、更间接、更强烈或更温和。

137
And in this dialogue, there are a few examples of how we use softening words to but just to do the opposite to actually make it a little strong.
在这个对话中，有几个例子展示了我们如何使用缓和词，但实际上是为了让它更强烈。

138
Okay, so why don't we start with the first paragraph.
好的，那我们为什么不从第一段开始呢？

139
In the first part of the dialogue, he said you missed a fairly significant deadline, a fairly significant deadline.
在对话的第一部分，他说你错过了一个相当重要的截止日期，一个相当重要的截止日期。

140
Now this word fairly, kind of sort of so it's not very significant.
现在这个词“相当”，有点像，所以它并不是非常重要。

141
It's kind of significant.
它有点重要。

142
Yeah.
是的。

143
But in this context, when when the person is saying it, it just sounds a little bit softer.
但在这个上下文中，当这个人说时，它听起来有点温和。

144
But your understanding is it's a very important deadline.
但你的理解是这是一个非常重要的截止日期。

145
Okay, a very important deadline.
好的，一个非常重要的截止日期。

146
So another similar example of this is the boss was saying you're essentially blaming the tech team.
所以另一个类似的例子是老板在说你基本上是在责怪技术团队。

147
Okay, you're essentially blaming.
好的，你基本上是在责怪。

148
So essentially is like basically or pretty much.
所以“基本上”就像是“基本上”或“差不多”。

149
So it sounds a little softer.
听起来有点温和。

150
But what he's actually really saying is, you're doing this right.
但他实际上是在说，你是在责怪技术团队。

151
So instead of saying, you're blaming the tech team, he adds this word essentially to kind of say, well, basically, you're saying it's their fault.
所以他没有直接说你在责怪技术团队，而是加上这个词“基本上”，以便说，嗯，基本上，你是在说这是他们的错。

152
Yeah.
是的。

153
But the context or you understand that it's actually very direct, and he's saying it's your fault.
但上下文或你理解的是他实际上是非常直接的，他在说这是你的错。

154
Yeah.
是的。

155
So he's, he's saying, you're almost blaming the tech team.
所以他说，你几乎是在责怪技术团队。

156
But what he means is you're blaming the tech team.
但他的意思是你在责怪技术团队。

157
Now, our third phrase is very interesting because it's kind of like a saying.
现在，我们的第三个短语非常有趣，因为它有点像一个说法。

158
That's right.
没错。

159
So the employee says, I'm not trying to pass the buck here.
所以员工说，我不是在推卸责任。

160
I'm not trying to pass the buck here.
我不是在推卸责任。

161
I'm not trying to pass the buck.

162
Now, what's the buck?
现在，什么是“责任”？

163
A dollar bill, a dollar bill.
一美元钞票，一美元钞票。

164
So he's will understand that he's saying I'm not trying to blame somebody else or pass the blame onto someone else.
所以他会理解他在说我不是在责怪别人或把责任推给别人。

165
But you can think about it like this.
但你可以这样想。

166
Like, imagine he had some fake or phony money, right?
比如，想象一下他有一些假钱，对吧？

167
And he wants to pass that on to the next person so he doesn't get in trouble.
他想把它传给下一个人，这样他就不会惹麻烦。

168

I'm not trying to pass the blame, put the responsibility on someone else.

171

但你知道他真正的意思是什么吗？

173
What?
什么？

174
I am trying to do this.
我是在这样做。

175
Because he knew, yeah, he knew that it was a fake dollar bill.
因为他知道，是的，他知道那是一张假钞。

176
Yeah, yeah.
是的，是的。

177
Now, the fourth one is interesting as well, because it's kind of like a metaphor.
现在，第四个也很有趣，因为它有点像一个隐喻。

178
He said, the boss said, you're using the small technical glitches as a crutch.
他说，老板说，你把小的技术故障当作拐杖。

179
So using something as a crutch.
所以把某物当作拐杖。

180
Now, the crutch is a... You know when you break your leg, you use those wooden or metal sticks to walk with?
现在，拐杖是……你知道，当你摔断腿时，你用那些木头或金属棍子走路，对吧？

181
Okay, to help you walk.
好的，帮助你走路。

182
Yeah.
是的。

183
So the boss is basically saying you're using these technical glitches as an excuse or as an aid to why you missed the deadline.
所以老板基本上是在说你把这些技术故障当作借口或帮助，来解释你为什么错过截止日期。

184
Yeah.
是的。

185
So if you think about it like this, some people might say, okay, if you walk with a crutch, then you won't succeed, right?
所以如果你这样想，有些人可能会说，好吧，如果你用拐杖走路，那么你就不会成功，对吧？

186
Because, whatever.
因为，无论如何。

187
So this guy, this employee is basically saying, yes, I know that I should meet deadlines.
所以这个家伙，这个员工基本上是在说，是的，我知道我应该遵守截止日期。

188
But these these problems, these glitches are like my crutch that make me not succeed.
但这些问题，这些故障就像是我的拐杖，让我无法成功。

189
Okay, so he's trying to just make excuses.
好的，所以他只是在找借口。

190
So, um, God, Marco, that was a little bit difficult to understand.
所以，嗯，天哪，马尔科，这有点难以理解。

191
Do you think we should give a couple more examples?
你认为我们应该再给几个例子吗？

192
Yeah, I think I think some more examples would be very useful.

213
You're essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues, rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks.

226
This employee got in a lot of trouble for missing his deadline.
这名员工因为错过截止日期而陷入了很多麻烦。

227
Exactly.

228
I think it's a very important aspect of not only Western culture, but also, in general, assuming guilt when it's your fault.
我认为这不仅是西方文化中非常重要的一个方面，而且在一般情况下，承认责任也是如此。

229
Yeah.
是的。

230
In this case, we saw that the employee didn't really want to accept the fact that it was his fault.
在这种情况下，我们看到员工并不真正想接受这是他的错。

231
Yeah, he didn't say, Yeah, I know it was me.
是的，他没有说，"是的，我知道是我。"

232
I'm sorry.
"对不起。"

233
And this is my plan to fix it.
"这是我解决问题的计划。"

234
Now, this is very important among cultures, because in some cultures, the aspect of losing face is so important, right?
现在，这在不同文化中非常重要，因为在某些文化中，失去面子是非常重要的，对吧？

235
Right.
对。

236
So somebody may not really want to assume guilt, or they have to because it's part of the culture.
所以，有些人可能不想承担责任，或者他们必须这样做，因为这是文化的一部分。

237
But what's the standard in North American business practice?
但北美商业实践的标准是什么？

238
I would say that you would have to assume responsibility and take responsibility for your actions, right?
我会说，你必须承担责任，为你的行为负责，对吧？

239
And say, Yes, it's my fault I did it, but I'm gonna get it fixed, or I'll do it or I'll make up for it.
并说，"是的，这是我的错，我做了，但我会解决它，或者我会做，或者我会弥补。"

240
So some good business tips here today in this lesson.
所以今天这节课里有一些好的商业建议。

241
