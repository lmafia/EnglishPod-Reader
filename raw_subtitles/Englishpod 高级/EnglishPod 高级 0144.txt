Hello, English learners.
你好，英语学习者。

2
Welcome back to EnglishPod.
欢迎回到EnglishPod。

3
My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

4
And my name is Catherine.
我叫Catherine。

5
And today we're talking about something very serious.
今天我们要谈论一个非常严肃的话题。

6
Very serious.
非常严肃。

7
Today we're talking about capital punishment.
今天我们要讨论死刑。

8
So, if you've never heard that phrase before, you might have heard another name for this topic.
如果你以前从未听过这个词，你可能听过这个话题的另一个名称。

9
It's called the death penalty.
它被称为死刑。

10
Right.
对。

11
So if you commit a crime, basically the judge says that you will have to be put to death for that crime.
所以如果你犯了罪，法官基本上会说你将因该罪被判死刑。

12
Alright, so many countries no longer have this, this law.
好吧，许多国家不再有这个法律。

13
In the United States you can see it in some places, some states, but not in others.
在美国，你可以在一些地方、一些州看到，但在其他地方则没有。

14
So, what we're talking about today is the debate between to have the death penalty and to not have it.
所以，今天我们讨论的是关于是否应该有死刑的辩论。

15
Alright, so we're going to actually have a little debate in the end of if we agree that we should have the death penalty or not.
好吧，我们最后会进行一个小辩论，看看我们是否同意应该有死刑。

16
But before that, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time.
但在此之前，为什么不先听听这个对话。

17
That's all for today's class.
今天的课就到这里。

18
We will continue our lecture on crime and punishment tomorrow.
我们明天将继续讲解犯罪与惩罚。

19
Do you think we should be tougher on crime?
你认为我们应该对犯罪更严厉吗？

20
Well, it depends on what you mean.
嗯，这要看你怎么理解。

21
For example, we could bring back the death penalty for murder, give longer prison sentences for lesser offenses, and lock up juvenile offenders.
例如，我们可以恢复对谋杀的死刑，对轻罪判更长的监禁，并关押青少年罪犯。

22
Those sound like really draconian measures.
这些听起来真是严厉的措施。

23
Firstly, what do you do about miscarriages of justice if you've already put innocent people to death?
首先，如果你已经把无辜的人判死刑，你该如何处理冤假错案？

24
You'd only use capital punishment if you were absolutely sure that you convicted the right person.
只有在你绝对确定你定罪的是正确的人时，才会使用死刑。

25
But there have been many cases of wrongful conviction where people have been imprisoned for many years.
但已经有很多错误定罪的案例，人们被监禁多年。

26
The authorities were sure at the time, but later it was shown that the evidence was unreliable.
当时当局是确信的，但后来证明证据不可靠。

27
In some cases, it had been fabricated by the police.
在某些情况下，证据是警方伪造的。

28
Well, no system of justice can be perfect, but surely there's a good case for longer prison sentences to deter serious crime.
嗯，没有哪个司法系统是完美的，但显然有理由认为更长的监禁可以威慑严重犯罪。

29
I doubt whether they could act as an effective deterrent while the detection rate is so low.
我怀疑在侦破率如此低的情况下，它们能否作为有效的威慑。

30
The best way to prevent crime is to convince people who commit it that they're going to be caught.
预防犯罪的最好方法是让犯罪者相信他们会被抓住。

31
It doesn't make sense to divert all your resources into the prison system.
把所有资源都投入监狱系统是没有意义的。

32
But if you detect more crimes, you'll still need prisons.
但如果你侦破更多的犯罪，你仍然需要监狱。

33
In my reckoning, if we could lock up more juvenile criminals, they'd learn that they can't get away with it.
在我看来，如果我们能关押更多的青少年罪犯，他们会明白自己无法逃脱。

34
Soft sentences will merely encourage them to do it again.
轻判只会鼓励他们再次犯罪。

35
Yes, but remember that prisons are often schools for criminals.
是的，但请记住，监狱往往是罪犯的学校。

36
To remove crime from society, you really have to tackle its causes.
要消除社会中的犯罪，你真的必须解决其根源。

37
Well, if I were president, I would impose tougher laws and punishment.
嗯，如果我是总统，我会实施更严格的法律和惩罚。

38
I would have a peaceful society based on fear of punishment, not consciousness of doing the right thing.
我会建立一个基于对惩罚的恐惧而非做正确事情意识的和平社会。

39
You sound like a dictator.
你听起来像个独裁者。

40
Well, if it works, why not?
嗯，如果有效，那为什么不呢？

41
Alright, so Marco, there's a lot of really great legal terms here, legal and crime terms.
好吧，Marco，这里有很多很棒的法律术语，法律和犯罪术语。

42
And so let's look at a few of these in today's Language Takeaway.
所以让我们在今天的语言收获中看看这些。

43
Language Takeaway Alright, so let's take a look at the first one.
语言收获 好吧，让我们看看第一个。

44
They mentioned juvenile offenders.
他们提到了青少年罪犯。

45
Alright, so let's look at these two words.
好吧，让我们看看这两个词。

46
Because, well, offender can be pretty general.
因为，嗯，罪犯可以是相当一般的。

47
It's someone who commits a crime.
这是指犯了罪的人。

48
So, an offender.
所以，罪犯。

49
But we're talking about a special kind of offender.
但我们在谈论一种特殊类型的罪犯。

50
Here we're talking about juvenile offenders.
这里我们在谈论青少年罪犯。

51
So they're young offenders.
所以他们是年轻的罪犯。

52
Right, and in America, legally, you're a juvenile offender if you're under the age of 18.
对，在美国，法律上，如果你未满18岁，你就是青少年罪犯。

53
Okay, so if you commit a crime while you are a juvenile, you get judged differently, right?
好吧，如果你在青少年时期犯了罪，你会受到不同的审判，对吧？

54
You don't get the same treatment as an adult.
你不会像成年人那样受到同样的对待。

55
Usually, the punishments are not as harsh.
通常，惩罚不会那么严厉。

56
Because people like to think that younger people, younger children or teenagers, they don't really understand the law.
因为人们喜欢认为年轻人、年轻的孩子或青少年，他们并不真正理解法律。

57
They don't really understand crime or good and bad.
他们并不真正理解犯罪或善恶。

58
So it should be easier on them.
所以对他们应该更宽容。

59
Alright, very good.
好吧，非常好。

60
So we have juvenile offenders.
所以我们有青少年罪犯。

61
And we also have a wrongful conviction.
我们还有错误定罪。

62
Alright, this is an uh-oh moment for a judge.
好吧，这对法官来说是一个糟糕的时刻。

63
Because a wrongful conviction... Well, conviction, first of all, is a decision.
因为错误定罪…… 首先，定罪是一个决定。

64
So this is a court's decision on whether or not a person is guilty.
所以这是法院对一个人是否有罪的决定。

65
So you convicted the person.
所以你定罪了这个人。

66
Right, Marco was convicted guilty of stealing my computer.
对，Marco被判定为偷了我的电脑有罪。

67
I was too.
我也是。

68
That happened.
这确实发生过。

69
Right, but it's a wrongful conviction if Marco didn't really steal a computer.
对，但如果Marco并没有真的偷电脑，那就是错误定罪。

70
But we decided that he did.
但我们决定他是有罪的。

71
Okay, so it was a wrong decision.
好吧，所以这是一个错误的决定。

72
Right, it was a bad decision in the sense that it's actually not what happened in reality.
对，这是一个坏决定，因为这实际上与现实不符。

73
A wrongful conviction.
错误定罪。

74
Very good.
非常好。

75
And actually related to a wrongful conviction, many times it happens because evidence is fabricated by the police.
实际上，与错误定罪相关的，很多时候是因为证据被警方伪造。

76
Alright, so this is a big no-no.
好吧，这绝对是个大忌。

77
This is something that really shouldn't happen and it's against the law in many countries.
这是不应该发生的事情，在许多国家都是违法的。

78
So fabrication or to fabricate is to fake.
所以伪造或伪造是指造假。

79
To make something up.
编造某些东西。

80
And so evidence that's fabricated is evidence that the police or other people create to try and make someone look guilty but it's not actually evidence.
所以伪造的证据是警方或其他人创造的证据，试图让某人看起来有罪，但实际上并不是证据。

81
It's not really... It's not true.
这并不真实…… 这不是真的。

82
It's not true.
这不是真的。

83
And now moving on, they were talking about a deterrent for crime.

好吧，所以我会试图威慑我的员工不要提前休午餐。

87
So I'm going to punish someone as a deterrent.
所以我会惩罚某人作为威慑。

88
As a deterrent.
作为威慑。

89
Okay, so you have the verb deter and you have the noun a deterrent.
好吧，所以你有动词威慑和名词威慑。

90
Right.
对。

91
Yeah, and so often times very strict laws are meant to be deterrents.
是的，所以通常非常严格的法律是为了威慑。

92
They're meant to keep people from doing bad things, from breaking the law.
它们旨在阻止人们做坏事，违反法律。

93
Alright, so for example, capital punishment is one of those deterrents.
好吧，例如，死刑就是其中一种威慑。

94
If you kill somebody, then if you get caught, you are also going to be killed.
如果你杀了某人，那么如果你被抓，你也会被杀。

95
So that means I'm never going to kill anyone because I don't want the law to decide that I'm going to get killed.
所以这意味着我永远不会杀任何人，因为我不想让法律决定我会被杀。

96
Exactly.
正是如此。

97
And our last word for today, they were talking about imposing tougher laws.
今天最后一个词，他们在谈论实施更严格的法律。

98
I would impose tougher laws.
我会实施更严格的法律。

99
Okay, so to impose is a verb that means to put in place or to set up or enact.
好吧，实施是一个动词，意味着实施、设立或颁布。

100
But by force, you don't really agree to do it.
但通过强制，你并不真正同意这样做。

101
Like, the dictator imposes his will.
就像独裁者强加他的意志。

102
Alright, so he makes everyone do what he wants.
好吧，他让每个人都做他想做的事。

103
But we can impose measures that do something.
但我们可以实施一些有效的措施。

104
Yeah, it's kind of like forcibly making people follow some kind of rule or follow a person.
是的，这有点像强迫人们遵循某种规则或跟随某个人。

105
Now, sometimes you would see that you have a company or you have people at your house and they're like, well, you know, stay over for dinner.
现在，有时你会看到你有公司或家里有客人，他们会说，呃，你知道，留下来吃晚餐吧。

106
And they're like, oh, I wouldn't want to impose.
他们会说，哦，我不想打扰你。

107
Alright, so I wouldn't want to bother you or I wouldn't want to create more work for you.
好吧，我不想给你添麻烦或增加你的工作量。

108
Because, you know, when you're making food, you have all these people, they don't want to impose on you.
因为你知道，当你做饭时，有很多人，他们不想打扰你。

109
Alright, so that's another way of using this, impose on somebody.
好吧，这就是另一种用法，打扰某人。

110
Alright, so after all of these words that we've taken a look at, why don't we start now with Fluency Builder.
好吧，在我们看过的这些词之后，为什么不现在开始流利表达构建器呢？

111
Okay, so as you know, Fluency Builder is a place where you get to talk about some phrases and words that allow you to be more fluent in English.
好的，正如你所知，流利表达构建器是一个让你谈论一些短语和词汇的地方，这些可以让你在英语中更流利。

112
So these are sometimes idioms or sometimes phrases, words that go together commonly.
这些有时是习语或短语，常用的词汇。

113
And the first one is no exception.
第一个也不例外。

114
It's a miscarriage, so miscarriage of justice.
这是一个误判，所以是司法误判。

115

116
Now we have different words here.
现在我们有不同的词。

126

好吧，这又是一个短语，每个词可能意味着不同的东西。

Do you agree with the death penalty?

177
Oh, this is a big one and I don't think we have enough time to go into it in much detail here, but I definitely think that is extreme, right?
哦，这是个大问题，我认为我们没有足够的时间在这里详细讨论，但我绝对认为这是极端的，对吧？

178
And so we have this phrase, a draconian measure.
所以我们有这个短语，严厉的措施。

179
Right, they mention that in the dialogue.
对，他们在对话中提到过。

180
Yeah, so draconian, something that's draconian is excessive or severe, you know?
是的，所以严厉的，指的是过度或严厉的东西，你知道吗？

181
And I think that there are a lot of reasons not to have the death penalty because the death penalty, well, you're pretty much saying we as a society think that murder is wrong, but we're going to show you that you've done a wrong thing, like a bad thing that's against the law by killing you.
我认为有很多理由不支持死刑，因为死刑，嗯，你基本上是在说我们作为一个社会认为谋杀是错误的，但我们将通过杀死你来向你展示你做错了事，像是违反法律的坏事。

182
Alright, and so I have to disagree with that on a philosophical level.
好吧，所以我在哲学层面上必须不同意这一点。

183
But what about practical?
但在实际层面上呢？

184
Practically speaking, I think that there are a lot of problems with the prison system and the legal system in the United States, for example, because prisons are really crowded.
从实际角度来看，我认为美国的监狱系统和法律系统存在很多问题，因为监狱真的很拥挤。

185
One percent of the American population is in prison, and so I think that so long as the prison system still has problems, there's a really good argument for having the death penalty.
美国人口的1%在监狱中，所以我认为只要监狱系统仍然存在问题，就有很好的理由支持死刑。

186
But still, I think that it's excessive and it's unnecessary and that there are other ways to treat and punish prisoners.
但我仍然认为这是过度的，不必要的，还有其他方法来对待和惩罚囚犯。

187
It is an interesting topic because you have many different angles that are in favor or against the death penalty.
这是一个有趣的话题，因为你有很多不同的角度支持或反对死刑。

188
For example, you have religious views where you say that you should not take a life of another person no matter what.
例如，你有宗教观点，认为无论如何都不应该夺取他人的生命。

189
Or you have other views that say that the death penalty is simply wrong and that you can't right a wrong with another wrong.
或者你有其他观点，认为死刑是错误的，不能用另一个错误来纠正错误。

190
Right, exactly.
对，确切地说。

191
So it kind of doesn't make sense.
所以这有点不合逻辑。

192
But at the same time, like you say, the prisons are full of people and it costs around $12,000 a year per person to keep them in prison.
但与此同时，正如你所说，监狱里满是人，每年每人维持在监狱中的费用大约是12,000美元。

193
So what do you do with all of these people that have life sentences that are going to spend the rest of their lives in jail?
那么你对那些将终身监禁的人该怎么办？

194
So it is interesting, and many countries are very, very strict with their legal system in comparison with the United States, right?
所以这很有趣，许多国家的法律系统与美国相比非常严格，对吧？

195
Definitely, but there is a statistic that's pretty stunning that I think among the top 20 developed nations in the world I think only the United States is the one with the death penalty.
绝对如此，但有一个相当惊人的统计数据，我认为在世界前20个发达国家中，只有美国有死刑。

196
And actually the ratio of people compared to the population that are in jail is much higher in the United States than in other countries.
实际上，美国监狱中囚犯与总人口的比例远高于其他国家。

197
That's true.
这是真的。

198
So it is a very questionable topic, but we want to know what you think.
所以这是一个非常值得质疑的话题，但我们想知道你的看法。

199
Do you think that the death penalty is a justifiable way to do justice?
你认为死刑是一个合理的司法方式吗？

200
Or do you think maybe it's just wrong and we shouldn't have it anymore?
还是你认为这可能是错误的，我们不应该再有死刑？

201
Yeah, we're hoping that this will get the conversation going on our website.
是的，我们希望这能在我们的网站上引发讨论。

202
If you have any opinions, please let us know about them.
如果你有任何意见，请告诉我们。

203
