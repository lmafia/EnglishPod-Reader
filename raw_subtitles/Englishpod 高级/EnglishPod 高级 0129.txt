And today we're bringing you part two of the presidential farewell speech of President Eisenhower.
今天我们将为您带来艾森豪威尔总统告别演说的第二部分。

6
That's right.

7
So we saw in a previous lesson the beginning of this speech.
在之前的课程中，我们看到了这篇演说的开头。

8
Now we're going to look towards the end of the speech.

9
Now we must tell you as well that we did change the speech a little bit, right?

The speech isn't this short.

We did take out a lot of stuff.
我们确实删掉了很多内容。

15
So again, Marco, why are we looking at this speech?
所以，Marco，我们为什么要看这篇演说？

16
What are we learning from it?
我们从中学到了什么？

17
Well, in this last part of the presidential farewell speech, there are a lot of great words that are more difficult and very poetic.
在这篇总统告别演说的最后部分，有很多很棒的词汇，比较难且非常富有诗意。

18
So you can use them in different formal circumstances or just to sound a little bit more well spoken.
所以你可以在不同的正式场合使用它们，或者只是为了听起来更有修养。

19
Yeah.
是的。

20
And we also, again, are going to look at some really quite difficult and challenging structures that we hope you can use maybe when you're giving a formal talk or, yeah, or even in your writing if you want to sound quite professional.
我们还将看到一些非常困难和具有挑战性的结构，希望你在进行正式演讲时可以使用，或者在写作中，如果你想听起来更专业。

21
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

22
So why don't we listen to the dialogue for the first time.

23
Let's listen how President Eisenhower says goodbye.
让我们听听艾森豪威尔总统是如何告别的。

24
And then we'll come back and look at the words.
然后我们再回来看看这些词。

25
We now stand 10 years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations.
我们现在站在一个世纪的中点，已经过去了10年，这个世纪见证了四场大国之间的主要战争。

26
Three of these involved our own country.

27
Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest, the most influential, and the most productive nation in the world.
尽管这些冲突造成了大量伤亡，但今天的美国是世界上最强大、最有影响力和最具生产力的国家。

28
We are understandably proud of this preeminence.

29
Yet we realize that America's leadership and prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches, and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.
然而，我们意识到，美国的领导地位和声望不仅仅依赖于我们无与伦比的物质进步、财富和军事力量，而在于我们如何利用我们的权力来促进世界和平和人类的改善。

30
Throughout America's adventure in free government, such basic purposes have been to keep the peace, to foster progress and human achievement, and to enhance Liberty, dignity, and integrity among peoples and among nations.
在美国自由政府的历程中，这些基本目标一直是维护和平、促进进步和人类成就，以及增强人民和国家之间的自由、尊严和诚信。

31
We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations, may have their great human needs satisfied, that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full, that all who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings, that those who have freedom will understand also its heavy responsibilities,
我们祈祷所有信仰、所有种族、所有国家的人们，能够满足他们伟大的人类需求，那些现在被剥夺机会的人能够充分享受机会，所有渴望自由的人能够体验到其精神祝福，拥有自由的人也能理解其沉重的责任，

32
that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity, that the scourges of poverty, disease, and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth, and that in the goodness of time all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love.
所有对他人需求无动于衷的人能够学会施舍，贫困、疾病和无知的祸害能够从地球上消失，并且在适当的时候，所有人民能够在相互尊重和爱的约束力下共同生活在和平中。

嗯，那确实是一篇非常感人的演说，是吧？

38
Very moving, and to a certain point a little bit religious, huh?
非常感人，某种程度上有点宗教色彩，嗯？

39
Yeah, I think we'll talk a little bit about that a little bit later, but let's concentrate on the language now.

40
So, we'll go to Language Takeaway.

42
All right, on Language Takeaway today, we'll start with our first word, and it's preeminence.

43
All right, we are understandably proud of this preeminence.

Okay, so in this case, America was the preeminent nation.

48
Right, so they were coming up, they were very prosperous, so they had a preeminence in the world.
对，所以他们正在崛起，他们非常繁荣，因此在世界上具有卓越地位。

49
All right, so I think we can see here you can use this as an adjective, a preeminent nation, or as a noun, an uncountable noun, the preeminence of our state.
好的，所以我认为我们可以看到，你可以将其用作形容词，卓越的国家，或作为名词，不可数名词，我们国家的卓越。

50
Very good.
非常好。

51
Since we can use this word as a noun and an adjective, why don't we listen to some more examples so we can get a better understanding of it.
既然我们可以将这个词用作名词和形容词，为什么不听一些更多的例子，以便更好地理解它呢？

52
Now please welcome Dr. Frank Hicks, the world's most preeminent expert on nuclear biology.
现在请欢迎弗兰克·希克斯博士，世界上最卓越的核生物学专家。

53
He's been a leader in his field for 25 years, and his preeminence has never been questioned.

54
Carol Dixon is one of the most preeminent experts in green technology.

55
All right, well, Eisenhower was talking about all of the things that the American people had done since they became a free nation.
好的，艾森豪威尔在谈论美国人民自成为自由国家以来所做的所有事情。

56
And one of these things was to foster progress in human achievement.
其中一件事是促进人类成就的进步。

57
Foster progress in human achievement.
促进人类成就的进步。

58
Well, I like this verb a lot, to foster something.
我非常喜欢这个动词，促进某事。

59
So if I say to foster progress or to foster something, what am I saying?
所以如果我说促进进步或促进某事，我在说什么？

60
To help something grow and develop.
帮助某事成长和发展。

61
To take care of it, to nurse it.
照顾它，培养它。

62
Yeah, we very commonly hear this word associated with children, right?
是的，我们通常会听到这个词与儿童相关，对吧？

63
A foster child.
寄养儿童。

64
Yeah, so what's that?
是的，那是什么？

65
If you have a foster child, you are basically taking care of a child because the parents can't look after him.
如果你有一个寄养儿童，你基本上是在照顾一个孩子，因为父母无法照顾他。

66
It's not like adopting because you don't actually... it's not actually legal.
这并不像收养，因为这并不合法。

67
It's just that you're helping somebody out by raising this child.
只是你通过抚养这个孩子来帮助某人。

68
Right.
对。

69
So we can see the connection there, a foster child to foster something.
所以我们可以看到，寄养儿童与促进某事之间的联系。

70
But you know, this is really a great word, and I think it would help to give a couple of examples of how we could use it.
但你知道，这真的是一个很好的词，我认为给出几个例子会有帮助。

71
So for example, I can say our company is looking to foster better creativity in the workplace.
例如，我可以说我们公司希望在工作场所促进更好的创造力。

72
Or we could say, here at Praxis Language, we foster the development of your English.
或者我们可以说，在Praxis Language，我们促进你的英语发展。

73
Very good.
非常好。

74
So the word foster.
所以这个词是促进。

75
Now moving on, in his speech, he was talking about nations and faiths and different types of groups.
现在继续，在他的演说中，他谈到了国家、信仰和不同类型的群体。

76
And he said, all who yearn for freedom.
他说，所有渴望自由的人。

77
All right, this this is a great phrase, all who yearn for freedom.
好的，这是一个很好的短语，所有渴望自由的人。

78
To yearn.

79
So to yearn for something.
所以渴望某事。

80
Now, if I yearn for freedom, or I yearn for something, it's basically that I really want it in my heart.
现在，如果我渴望自由，或者我渴望某事，基本上是我在心里非常想要它。

81
Yeah, you really wish for it in a way that's almost painful.
是的，你真的以一种几乎痛苦的方式希望它。

82
You know, you want it so badly.
你知道，你想要它如此强烈。

83
Now you wouldn't say like, I'm yearning for ice cream, would you?
现在你不会说，我渴望冰淇淋，对吧？

84
No, unless you were locked up in prison and hadn't had ice cream for 55 years.
不，除非你被关在监狱里，55年没吃冰淇淋。

85
Exactly.
正是如此。

86
So it's usually related to something that's very difficult to get or something like freedom or yearning for... That's really important.
所以通常与很难获得的东西有关，或者像自由这样的东西，或者渴望...那真的很重要。

87
Exactly.
正是如此。

88
Something very important.
一些非常重要的东西。

89
And now for our last word, President Eisenhower was talking about charity, he was talking about freedom.

他提到了贫困的祸害。

Okay, so scourges.
好的，祸害。

92
The scourges of poverty.

So now relating it back to the text, we see the scourges of poverty.

103
Yes, scourges of poverty, scourges of disease and scourges of ignorance.
是的，贫困的灾害，疾病的灾害和无知的灾害。

104
All right, so we can see that poverty, ignorance and disease cause a lot of really terrible things, right?
好吧，我们可以看到贫困、无知和疾病造成了很多可怕的事情，对吧？

105
Exactly.
确切地说。

106
So that's why we say they are scourges.
所以这就是我们说它们是灾害的原因。

107
Okay, so scourges.
好的，所以灾害。

108
Now, that brings us to the end of our words for takeaway today.
现在，这带我们结束今天的词汇总结。

109
But, you know, as we talked about earlier, we've got some really difficult and interesting structures to look at now in Fluency Builder.
但是，正如我们之前所谈到的，我们现在有一些非常困难和有趣的结构要在流利构建器中查看。

110
Fluency Builder.
流利构建器。

111
Okay, so in Fluency Builder, we'll start off with the very first sentence of the paragraph when he said, we now stand 10 years past the midpoint of a century.
好的，在流利构建器中，我们将从段落的第一句话开始，他说，我们现在站在一个世纪的中点过去10年。

112
Okay, so I love this phrase, we now stand 10 years past the midpoint of the century.
好的，我喜欢这个短语，我们现在站在一个世纪的中点过去10年。

113
Now, it's interesting because he is making reference to the future in the present.
现在，这很有趣，因为他在现在提到未来。

114
And he's using a great phrase to do that, we now stand.
他用一个很好的短语来做到这一点，我们现在站着。

115
Now, we can change it a little bit and use the first part, we now stand in different circumstances.

116
So why don't we listen to a couple of examples.
那么我们为什么不听几个例子呢？

117

123
All right, so you can see that this is a wonderful phrase to use maybe in a formal speech, right?
好吧，你可以看到这是一个很好的短语，可能在正式演讲中使用，对吧？

124
Right, or a wedding again, or a formal ceremony.
对，或者在婚礼上，或者在正式的仪式中。

125
Yeah.
是的。

126
So and it gives you this idea, this sort of very poetic image of people sort of almost standing at the cliff, standing before the, you know, some big change that's about to take place.
所以它给你这种想法，这种几乎站在悬崖边缘的诗意形象，站在即将发生的一些重大变化面前。

127
Exactly.
确切地说。

128
So 10 years past the midpoint of a century, the United States has witnessed four major wars, right?
所以在一个世纪的中点过去10年，美国经历了四场重大战争，对吧？

129
Okay.
好的。

130
And well, he said, despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest, the most influential and most productive nation in the world.
他提到，尽管这些冲突造成了大量伤亡，今天的美国是世界上最强大、最有影响力和最具生产力的国家。

131
Okay, so a great, great, great structure here.
好的，这里有一个很好的结构。

132
Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America today is the strongest, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
尽管这些冲突造成了大量伤亡，今天的美国是最强大的，等等。

133
Right.
对。

134
Now, let's look at that first word, despite the carnage of these conflicts.
现在，让我们看看第一个词，尽管这些冲突造成了大量伤亡。

135
Okay, so carnage, what's that?
好的，伤亡，是什么？

136
Carnage is like a massacre, right?
伤亡就像大屠杀，对吧？

137
Where many people got hurt or killed.
许多人受伤或被杀。

138
Okay, so a pretty violent situation when a lot of people died.
好的，所以这是一个相当暴力的情况，很多人死了。

139
And now why does he use this word despite?
现在他为什么使用这个词尽管？

140
Okay, so he's basically saying, even though we had all of this death and violence in this century, we're still the greatest nation, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
好的，他基本上是在说，尽管在这个世纪我们经历了所有这些死亡和暴力，我们仍然是最伟大的国家，等等。

141
Exactly, that's exactly it.
确切地说，就是这样。

142
I can say, for example, despite the economic crisis the world is going through, our company has an enormous opportunity to grow and be more profitable.
我可以说，例如，尽管世界正在经历经济危机，我们公司有巨大的增长和盈利机会。

143
Okay, or if we want to take it and imagine we're at a wedding, we might say something like this.
好的，或者如果我们想把它想象成在婚礼上，我们可能会说这样的事情。

144
You could say, despite the many difficulties this couple has faced, they have a very bright and happy future together.
你可以说，尽管这对夫妇面临许多困难，他们有一个非常光明和幸福的未来。

145
Very good.
非常好。

146
And now if we take a look at the last paragraph, it's very interesting because it's one sentence.
现在如果我们看看最后一段，这非常有趣，因为它是一个句子。

147
It's a really long sentence.
这是一个非常长的句子。

148
It's a very long sentence.
这是一个非常长的句子。

149
So even though it's not a phrase, let's take a look at the punctuation of this paragraph.
所以即使这不是一个短语，让我们看看这个段落的标点符号。

150
Okay, so Eisenhower starts out by saying, we pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations may have their great human needs satisfied.
好的，艾森豪威尔开始说，我们祈祷所有信仰、所有种族、所有国家的人们能够满足他们的重大人类需求。

151
And then we have a semicolon there, right?
然后我们有一个分号，对吧？

152
Right.
对。

153
So why do we have a semicolon?
那么我们为什么有一个分号？

154
Well, here's what he's doing.
好吧，他在说我们为某事祈祷。

155
He's saying we pray for something.
然后他列出了他所祈祷的许多不同的事情。

156
And then he's listing the many different things that he's praying for.
好的，所以这基本上是一个列表。

157
Okay, so it's basically a list.
是的。

158
Yep.
好的。

159
Okay.
所以我们知道，当你写一个列表时，我们通常在这个列表中的所有事物之间使用逗号。

160
So we know that when you're writing a list, we commonly use commas between all the things that are in this list.
但在这里，因为它们是长而复杂的想法，逗号是不够的，对吧？

161
But here, because they are long and complex ideas, a comma is not enough, right?
你需要一个分号。

162
You need a semicolon.
好的，所以我们可以从文本中看到，分号是分隔大思想、复杂思想的好方法。

163
Okay, so we can see here from the text that the semicolon is a great way to separate ideas, big ideas, complex ideas in a list.
确切地说。

164
Exactly.

165
So you can use it and not necessarily have to end your sentence or that each idea become one sentence.
所以你可以使用它，而不必结束你的句子，或者每个想法变成一个句子。

166
You can all just make it in one big sentence.
你可以把它们都放在一个大句子中。

167
Yep.
是的。

168
You know, and actually, I remember back to high school, Marco, my teacher told me, hey, if you throw in a few semicolons into your writing and do it properly, you'll really impress people.
你知道，实际上，我记得在高中时，马尔科，我的老师告诉我，嘿，如果你在写作中加入几个分号并正确使用，你会让人印象深刻。

169
Alright, so this is good advice that you can take and throw in a couple of semicolons, a little bit of commas here and there and it'll look like you really know how to write.
好吧，这是一条很好的建议，你可以加入几个分号，偶尔加一点逗号，它看起来就像你真的知道如何写。

170
Yep.
是的。

171
Okay.
好的。

172
So with that in mind, why don't we listen to what Eisenhower wrote one last time?
所以考虑到这一点，我们为什么不再听一遍艾森豪威尔写的内容？

173
We now stand 10 years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations.
我们现在站在一个世纪的中点过去10年，这个世纪见证了四场主要战争。

174
Three of these involved our own country.
其中三场涉及我们自己的国家。

175
Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest, the most influential and the most productive nation in the world.
尽管这些冲突造成了大量伤亡，今天的美国是世界上最强大、最有影响力和最具生产力的国家。

176
We are understandably proud of this preeminence.
我们对此卓越感到自豪。

177
Yet we realize that America's leadership and prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.
然而我们意识到，美国的领导地位和声望不仅仅依赖于我们无与伦比的物质进步、财富和军事力量，而在于我们如何在世界和平和人类改善的利益中使用我们的权力。

178
Throughout America's adventure in free government, such basic purposes have been to keep the peace, to foster progress in human achievement, and to enhance Liberty, dignity and integrity among peoples and among nations.
在美国的自由政府冒险中，这些基本目标一直是保持和平、促进人类成就的进步，以及增强人民和国家之间的自由、尊严和诚信。

179
We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations may have their great human needs satisfied.
我们祈祷所有信仰、所有种族、所有国家的人们能够满足他们的重大人类需求。

180
That those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full.
那些现在被剥夺机会的人将能够充分享受它。

181
That all who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings.
所有渴望自由的人都能体验到其精神祝福。

182
That those who have freedom will understand also its heavy responsibilities.
拥有自由的人也将理解其沉重的责任。

183
That all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity.
所有对他人需求无动于衷的人将学习慈善。

184
That the scourges of poverty, disease and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth.
贫困、疾病和无知的灾害将从地球上消失。

185
And that in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love.
在时光的善良中，所有人民将共同生活在由相互尊重和爱所保障的和平中。

186
Now on Friday noon, I am to become a private citizen.
现在在周五中午，我将成为一名普通公民。

187
I am proud to do so.
我为此感到自豪。

188
I look forward to it.
我期待着。

189
Thank you and good night.
谢谢，晚安。

190
All right, we're back.
好吧，我们回来了。

191
And we're here again with Pete, our voice actor for the second part of the dialogue.
我们再次与我们的配音演员皮特在一起，进行对话的第二部分。

192
And Pete, we have a couple more questions for you today.
皮特，我们今天还有几个问题要问你。

193
Cool.
酷。

194
So I hear in Eisenhower's speech that he keeps referencing God, like he keeps saying, I pray, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
我在艾森豪威尔的演讲中听到他不断提到上帝，比如他说，我祈祷，等等。

195
He said, God's speed, blah, blah, blah, blah.
他说，上帝保佑，等等。

196
So what's up with that?
这是什么意思？

197
Why is he talking about God?
他为什么谈论上帝？

198
Well, this is a very interesting question.
这是个很有趣的问题。

199
Traditionally, America has had a really clear boundary between church and state.
传统上，美国在教会和国家之间有着明确的界限。

200
And you'll hear a lot of rhetoric these days that says, you know, we're a Christian nation, and we were founded as a Christian nation.
现在你会听到很多言论说，我们是一个基督教国家，最初是作为基督教国家建立的。

201
Well, that's baloney.
这完全是胡说。

202
Baloney.
胡说。

203
So it's not true.
这不是真的。

204
At the time when the country was founded 200 years ago, it was overwhelmingly Christian.
在200年前国家成立时，确实是以基督教为主。

205
If the founding fathers, as we call them, the like George Washington, if they had wanted a Christian nation, they could have had it.
如果我们称之为开国元勋的乔治·华盛顿等人想要一个基督教国家，他们是可以做到的。

206
They explicitly did not.
他们明确表示不想要。

207
And a lot of people since then have gotten that confused.
许多人对此感到困惑。

208
And now, when we have a very large Muslim population, we have Buddhists, we have, you know, people in all various different kinds of, you know, Mormonism and everything.
现在，当我们有一个庞大的穆斯林人口，还有佛教徒，以及各种不同信仰的人时，这种可能性更小了。

209
It's even less possible now.
所以当我听到人们说美国是一个基督教国家时，我感到困惑。

210
So I'm kind of baffled when I hear people say that America is a Christian nation.
但现在硬币上，或者说在钱上，也有这个对吧？

211
But you even have it now in the coins, like or on the money, right?
上面写着“我们信仰上帝”。

212
It says in God we trust.
对。

213
Right.
这始于20世纪初。

214
That started in the early 20th century.
我想那是西奥多·罗斯福时代。

215
I think that was Teddy Roosevelt era.
他反对这个。

216
He opposed that.
罗斯福确实反对这个。

217
Roosevelt was really opposed to that.
但是……然后发生了什么？

218
But... And then what happened?
他们批准了。

219
They approved it.
是的。

220
Yeah.
而且，人们后来说，比如艾森豪威尔谈论这些事情时，在美国，我们有一个叫做效忠誓言的东西，我想你们可能没有。

221
And, you know, people said later, like Eisenhower talking about this stuff, you know, in America, we have something called the Pledge of Allegiance, which I don't think you guys probably have.
在加拿大没有。

222
Not in Canadian.
显然，你不会对美国做这个，而是对你自己的国家。

223
Obviously, you wouldn't do it to America, but to your own.
这有点……像是对国旗的致敬，对吧？

224
It's kind of... Like a salute to the flag, right?
是的，有点民族主义。

225
Yeah, it's a little bit nationalist.
我在成长过程中做过这个。

226
I did it growing up.
你把手放在心口，面向国旗，说：“我效忠于美利坚合众国的国旗，以及它所代表的共和国，一个在上帝之下的不可分割的国家，享有自由与正义。”

227
You put your hand over your heart and you face the flag and you say, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with Liberty and justice for all.
关于“一个在上帝之下的国家”这部分，是在50年代添加的，作为表明美国不是所谓的无神论共产主义国家的一种方式。

228
That part about one nation under God, that was added in the 50s as a kind of a way of showing that America is not, quote unquote, a godless communist country.
哇。

229
Wow.

230
Yeah, because communism teaches, you know, no religion.
是的，因为共产主义教导没有宗教。

231
And so they make sure we're not communist.
所以他们确保我们不是共产主义。

232
Okay, but we don't think that, right?
好吧，但我们不这样认为，对吧？

233
Yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm all about tolerance.
是的，我是非常包容的。

234
So I think that's kind of absurd.
所以我觉得这有点荒谬。

235
Okay, so what I think is really interesting, though, is that every political speech, every time a political leader has to say something publicly, he'll always quote God, right?
好吧，我觉得很有趣的是，每次政治演讲，每当政治领袖需要公开发言时，他总是会引用上帝，对吧？

236
Right.
对。

237
And they'll often end a speech with, you know, thank you and God bless America or something.
他们通常会以“谢谢，上帝保佑美国”之类的话结束演讲。

238
Yeah, exactly.
是的，确切地说。

239
Which, you know, what, for me as a Canadian is really strange.
对我这个加拿大人来说，这真的很奇怪。

240
Like if if a Canadian president said, God bless Canada, no one would know what to do.
如果一个加拿大总统说“上帝保佑加拿大”，没人会知道该怎么办。

241
I don't I don't know.
我不知道。

242
Anyway, I had an ex girlfriend who was British and she like Tony Blair started with that a couple times.
不管怎样，我有一个前女友是英国人，她像托尼·布莱尔那样开始说过几次。

243
He said, you know, and God bless us all or something.
他说，“上帝保佑我们所有人”之类的话。

244
And she was just put off by it.
她对此感到不快。

245
And she was like, the Brits will never take this and they didn't.
她说，英国人永远不会接受这个，他们也没有。

246
No one was impressed.
没有人对此感到印象深刻。

247
All right.
好吧。

248
Well, an interesting feature of American history, politics and society.
这是美国历史、政治和社会的一个有趣特征。

249
