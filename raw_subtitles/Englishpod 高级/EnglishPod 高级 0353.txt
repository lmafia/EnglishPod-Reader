This is actually a user suggestion that they wanted to know more or less what it would be like a dialogue between friends on a typical day in college.
这实际上是用户的建议，他们想知道大学里朋友之间典型一天的对话是什么样的。

6
All right, so this is an advanced level lesson.
好的，这是一节高级课程。

7
We're going to be talking in a normal conversational speed.

是的，我想是的。

16
I pledged Phi Iota Alpha, so I'm living at the frat house now.
我加入了Phi Iota Alpha，所以现在住在兄弟会的宿舍里。

17
Oh, so you're a frat boy now, huh?
哦，所以你现在是个兄弟会的男孩了，嗯？

18
Yeah, yeah, I know.
是的，我知道。

19
It's totally cliche, but really, I think it's been a good decision.
这完全是陈词滥调，但我真的觉得这是个好决定。

20

25
I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about.
我最终退掉了那门我很期待的金属加工课。

26
It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped.
这门课并没有我想象中那么有趣。

27
The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count.
辅导员建议我专注于我的先修课程，以确保学分能算。

28
That sounds smart, but kind of boring.
听起来聪明，但有点无聊。

29
Yeah, it is a little bit.
是的，确实有点。

30
I joined the great outdoors club, though, which has been a lot of fun.
不过我加入了户外俱乐部，玩得很开心。

31
We've gone on two camping trips already, and I've made some good friends.
我们已经去过两次露营，我交了一些好朋友。

32
That's cool.
那很好。

33
Hey, so have you decided on your major yet?
嘿，你决定专业了吗？

34
Definitely pre-med.
当然是预科医学。

35
What about you?
你呢？

36
I still have no clue.
我还是没头绪。

37
But we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year, so I've got time.
但我们要到大二才需要确定专业，所以我还有时间。

38
Oops, I'm late for class.
哎呀，我上课迟到了。

39
Gotta run.
我得走了。

40
Okay, take care.
好的，保重。

41
Hey, nice running into you.
嘿，碰到你真不错。

42
Yeah, you too.
是啊，你也是。

43
Alright, we're back.
好吧，我们回来了。

44
So now let's start with all these words and phrases on language takeaway.
现在让我们开始讨论这些语言要点的单词和短语。

45
So, hey Jordan, is that you?
嘿，Jordan，是你吗？

46
Long time no see.
好久不见。

47
I love this phrase.
我喜欢这个短语。

48
Right, this phrase, long time no see, which if you look at it, it doesn't really make sense.
对，这个短语“好久不见”，如果你仔细看，它其实没有什么意义。

49
It looks like we're missing a couple words.
看起来我们缺少几个词。

50
It looks like an incomplete sentence.
这看起来像是一个不完整的句子。

51
Yeah, like the subject, who.
是的，像主语，谁。

52
I haven't seen you, you haven't seen you.
我没见过你，你没见过你。

53
So really, the meaning of this is, I haven't seen you in a long time.
所以这实际上是说，我很久没见过你。

54
That's right.
没错。

55
And actually, I've heard that this phrase was taken from Chinese.
其实，我听说这个短语是从中文中来的。

56
I've also heard that, so it's kind of like pidgin English.
我也听说过，所以这有点像洋泾浜英语。

57
And now it's very, very common in English to say this.
现在在英语中说这个非常普遍。

58
You say this with your friends.
你和朋友说这个。

59
It's very casual.
这很随意。

60
And yeah, long time no see.
是的，好久不见。

61
Because if you translate this literally to Chinese, it makes sense, right?
因为如果你把这个字面翻译成中文，它是有意义的，对吧？

62
Yes, it does.
是的，确实如此。

63
So it's interesting.
所以这很有趣。

64
All right, so we haven't seen our friend in a long time and he's like, yeah, no kidding.
好吧，我们很久没见到朋友了，他说，是啊，没开玩笑。

65
You know what?
你知道吗？

66
I think it's been since orientation.
我想自迎新会以来就没见过了。

67
So what is this orientation that he's talking about?
那么他所说的迎新会是什么？

68
Now, this is an important part of the average American college experience.
这是美国大学经历中一个重要的部分。

69
Orientation is a special time, maybe for one week or a couple days at the very beginning of your first year of university.
迎新会是一个特殊的时间，可能持续一周或几天，在你大学第一年的开始。

70
All right, so my first week of school, I didn't have any classes, but I went to school and with all of the other first year students were called freshmen.
好吧，我上学的第一周没有任何课程，但我去学校，和所有其他新生一起。

71
I had to do activities and meet people and sign up for classes.
我必须参加活动，认识人，注册课程。

72
And basically orientation is a time when you learn about a new system or a new program.
基本上，迎新会是你了解新系统或新项目的时间。

73
So how it works, because, you know, maybe you don't really know yet how to pick your classes or where the dorms are or how the meals work if you have to go to the cafeteria, et cetera, right?
所以它是如何运作的，因为你知道，也许你还不知道如何选择课程，宿舍在哪里，餐食如何运作，如果你必须去自助餐厅等等，对吧？

74
Exactly, and it comes from the verb to orient.
正是如此，它来自动词“定位”。

75
So I orient myself by facing the right direction.
所以我通过面向正确的方向来定位自己。

76
So orientation is really about teaching you how to start in a new system.
所以迎新会实际上是教你如何在新系统中开始。

77
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

78
So, well, that was three months ago and a lot has happened.
所以，那是三个月前，发生了很多事情。

79
Our speaker says that he pledged Phi Iota Alpha.
我们的讲者说他加入了Phi Iota Alpha。

80
So what is this, to pledge in this?
那么，加入这个是什么意思？

81
Now, this is Greek as well.
这也是希腊语。

82
Phi Iota Alpha is Greek, and this means that we're talking about a fraternity.
Phi Iota Alpha是希腊语，这意味着我们在谈论一个兄弟会。

83
So fraternity is a group of boys, a sorority is a group of girls, and these are communities, so social societies, that you have to apply to be a member of.
所以兄弟会是一群男孩，姐妹会是一群女孩，这些是社区，所以社交团体，你必须申请成为成员。

84
But we don't say apply.
但我们不说申请。

85
Right, you pledge.
对，你是加入。

86
You pledge, so it's like I pledge allegiance.
你加入，所以就像我宣誓效忠。

87
You say, I want to be in your group, I want to be in your fraternity, and so you will have to do special things to become a member.
你说，我想加入你们的团体，我想加入你们的兄弟会，所以你必须做一些特别的事情才能成为成员。

88
So the verb to pledge would be to basically to promise something honorably or faithfully, right?
所以动词“加入”基本上是指以荣誉或忠诚的方式承诺某事，对吧？

89
Exactly, and that's the nice way of putting it.
没错，这是一种很好的说法。

90
But generally, when you talk about sororities and fraternities, these upperclassmen, so third, fourth year students, they make the students who are pledging do very weird things.
但通常，当你谈论姐妹会和兄弟会时，这些高年级学生，三年级、四年级的学生，会让正在加入的学生做一些很奇怪的事情。

91
So as you said, this is for these two guys, this is for a fraternity.
正如你所说，这对这两个家伙来说是一个兄弟会。

92
But if it's this type of club for girls, it's called a... Sorority.
但如果是这种类型的女孩俱乐部，它叫做... 姐妹会。

93
Okay, so it's different.
好吧，所以这是不同的。

94
So I'm pledging this sorority, that means I'm trying to become a member of this sorority.
所以我正在加入这个姐妹会，这意味着我正在努力成为这个姐妹会的成员。

95
So I think it's worthwhile mentioning, many of you have probably seen it in movies, these fraternities or sororities, and they all have names based on the Greek alphabet.
我认为值得一提的是，许多人可能在电影中见过这些兄弟会或姐妹会，它们都有基于希腊字母的名称。

96
Right, so the letters Phi Iota Alpha or Kappa Kappa Gamma, these are the letters that basically represent the name of the fraternity.
对，所以字母Phi Iota Alpha或Kappa Kappa Gamma，这些字母基本上代表兄弟会的名称。

97
And what's interesting is that maybe I am in Kappa Kappa Gamma at my school, there's another school with another Kappa Kappa Gamma, we're all related.
有趣的是，也许我在我的学校是Kappa Kappa Gamma，另一个学校也有另一个Kappa Kappa Gamma，我们都是相关的。

98
It's the same social community.
这是同一个社交社区。

99
So they sometimes do events together, things like that.
所以他们有时会一起举办活动，类似的事情。

100
So actually these fraternities or sororities, it's not independent to a school.
所以实际上这些兄弟会或姐妹会，并不是独立于某个学校。

101
It's actually like a wide network of people that belong to this club.
实际上，这就像是一个属于这个俱乐部的广泛网络。

102
Exactly, it's a national network usually.
确切地说，通常这是一个全国性的网络。

103
So it's kind of like being in the Boy Scouts.
所以这有点像是加入童子军。

104
Yeah, similar, except the activities are much different.
是的，类似，但活动非常不同。

105
That's right.
没错。

106
So these people, they may live at the frat house, like in this dialogue, he's living at the frat house.
所以这些人，他们可能住在兄弟会的宿舍里，就像在这个对话中，他住在兄弟会的宿舍里。

107
Now remember here, fraternity, that becomes frat if we're talking colloquially.
现在记住，兄弟会，如果我们用口语说，就是兄弟会。

108
So the frat house is the fraternity house, it's where those boys live.
所以兄弟会的宿舍就是兄弟会的房子，那是那些男孩住的地方。

109
But only the Phi Iota Alpha boys.
但只有Phi Iota Alpha的男孩。

110
Right, so no one... if I have a friend and he's not Phi Iota Alpha, then he can't live there.
对，所以没有人……如果我有一个朋友，他不是Phi Iota Alpha，那他就不能住那里。

111
Exactly, and we have a similar thing for girls, that's the sorority house.
确切地说，我们对女孩也有类似的说法，那就是姐妹会的宿舍。

112
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

113
So a frat house is the fraternity house, basically like their club house.
所以兄弟会的宿舍基本上就是他们的俱乐部房子。

114
Where they live though, yeah.
他们住的地方，是的。

115
Right, and so sometimes guys that belong to fraternities, they're referred to as frat boys.
对，所以有时属于兄弟会的男孩被称为兄弟会男孩。

116
Hey, frat boy, yeah, so fraternity boy, this is not always the nicest thing to say.
嘿，兄弟会男孩，是的，所以兄弟会男孩，这并不总是好听的话。

117
It's got a negative meaning, because a lot of the activities that frat boys do stereotypically involve lots of drinking and maybe being loud.
这有负面含义，因为兄弟会男孩的许多活动通常涉及大量饮酒和可能的喧闹。

118
So frat boy is someone who's in a fraternity and it's usually a critical way of talking about those guys.
所以兄弟会男孩是指在兄弟会中的人，通常是批评性地谈论这些家伙。

119
So this whole fraternity-sorority thing, as he said, is a little bit cliche, right?
所以整个兄弟会-姐妹会的事情，正如他说的，有点陈词滥调，对吧？

120
Yeah, this is a great word.
是的，这是个很好的词。

121
I use this a lot, actually.
我实际上经常使用这个词。

122
So something that's cliche would be almost what's expected, but in a bad way, right?
所以陈词滥调的东西几乎是预期的，但以一种不好的方式，对吧？

123
So you joining a fraternity is a little bit cliche, because it's kind of like... It's what everyone does in the movies and on TV, like, oh, I'm going to college, I'm going to join a fraternity.
所以你加入兄弟会有点陈词滥调，因为这就像……这是每个人在电影和电视中都会做的事情，比如，哦，我要上大学，我要加入兄弟会。

124
It's almost like, boring, it's so normal.
这几乎是无聊的，太正常了。

125
But you could also say that that movie, at the end of the movie, the man and the woman, they fought, but then they got back together.
但你也可以说那部电影，在电影的结尾，男人和女人，他们争吵，但然后他们又在一起。

126
It's so cliche.
这太陈词滥调了。

127
Right.
对。

128
So it's something that's overused, expected, very typical.
所以这是过度使用的东西，预期的，非常典型。

129
Uninteresting, yeah.
无趣，是的。

130
Uninteresting, okay.
无趣，好的。

131
So we have a cliche, we're saying that a fraternity is cliche.
所以我们有一个陈词滥调，我们说兄弟会是陈词滥调。

132
Now, the other guy, on the other hand, is living off campus.
现在，另一个家伙，另一方面，住在校外。

133
He lives at home, but he said he commutes to school every day.
他住在家里，但他说他每天通勤上学。

134
So he says, I'm commuting to school.
所以他说，我在通勤上学。

135
This is interesting.
这很有趣。

136
Now, in America, there's usually two options.
现在，在美国，通常有两个选择。

137
One is to live on campus.
一个是住在校园里。

138
That means to live at your university in a dormitory or an apartment.
这意味着住在你的大学的宿舍或公寓里。

139
But many people commute, and this means they drive to school every day, and then they drive home at night.
但很多人通勤，这意味着他们每天开车上学，然后晚上开车回家。

140
They don't live on the campus.
他们不住在校园里。

141
So you can also commute to work every day, right?
所以你也可以每天通勤上班，对吧？

142
This is what people do.
这是人们所做的。

143
You don't live at the office.
你不住在办公室里。

144
Exactly.
确切地说。

145
I hope not.
我希望不是。

146
No, this is a common thing.
不，这是一种常见的事情。

147
People will drive to work, and you might ask them, How long is your commute?
人们会开车上班，你可能会问他们，你的通勤时间有多长？

148
So you say, oh, one hour.
所以你说，哦，一个小时。

149
That means I drive one hour to work.
这意味着我开车上班一个小时。

150
So if I take the bus or the train, the subway, is that also commuting?
所以如果我坐公交车或火车，地铁，这也是通勤吗？

151
It is.
是的。

152
It doesn't matter how you do it.
这并不重要你怎么做。

153
It just means you don't live where you work or where you study, so you have to travel there by some means of transportation.
这只是意味着你不住在你工作或学习的地方，所以你必须通过某种交通方式到达那里。

154
Okay.
好的。

155
So, well, now going back to the academic aspect of this dialogue, he said that he ended up dropping a class.
所以，现在回到这个对话的学术方面，他说他最终退掉了一门课。

156
Okay, so to drop means to stop attending a class.
好的，所以退掉意味着停止上课。

157
Maybe you don't have enough time, maybe you don't like it, but to drop a class means you will no longer study, you will not take the tests, you will not get a grade.
也许你没有足够的时间，也许你不喜欢，但退掉一门课意味着你将不再学习，你不会参加考试，你不会获得成绩。

158
It's the opposite of to sign up for a class or to register for a class.
这与注册一门课或报名一门课是相反的。

159
So the difference between dropping a class and failing a class is that basically you're making the decision to not go there anymore.
所以退掉一门课和不及格的区别在于，你基本上是在做出不再去的决定。

160
Exactly, and usually there's a time you can do this, so for the first two weeks you can attend classes, and if you don't have enough time or you don't like a class, you can drop the class.
确切地说，通常有一个时间你可以这样做，所以在前两周你可以上课，如果你没有足够的时间或你不喜欢一门课，你可以退掉这门课。

161
But if you stay in the class, you just don't come or you do very poorly on your tests, that's called failing.
但如果你留在课堂上，你只是没有来或者在考试中表现很差，那就叫不及格。

162
So there are some classes, because I don't know, can you drop any class or do you have to take them at some point?
所以有些课程，因为我不知道，你可以退掉任何课程还是必须在某个时候上它们？

163
That's a good question.
这是个好问题。

164
That's our next phrase.
这是我们的下一个短语。

165
That's a prerequisite course, right?
这是先修课程，对吧？

166
So usually the university in America will tell you, you have to study math, you have to study one semester of science, you have to study English, you know, for one semester.
所以通常美国的大学会告诉你，你必须学习数学，你必须学习一个学期的科学，你必须学习英语，你知道，学习一个学期。

167
So these are called prerequisites.
所以这些被称为先修课程。

168
It's when the university tells you you have to study something.
这是当大学告诉你你必须学习某些东西。

169
Right, and I think you also have some courses that you can't take until you've passed some other course, right?
对，而且我认为你也有一些课程，直到你通过某些其他课程之前你不能上，对吧？

170
So like, for example, you can't take economy unless you've passed, I don't know, calculus.
所以例如，你不能上经济学，除非你通过了，我不知道，微积分。

171
Exactly, that's another prerequisite.
确切地说，那是另一个先修课程。

172
So we'd say, the prerequisite for economics is Calculus 1.
所以我们会说，经济学的先修课程是微积分1。

173
Or the prerequisite for Spanish 200 is Spanish 100.
或者西班牙语200的先修课程是西班牙语100。

174
It means you have to take something before you take something else.
这意味着你必须先上某些课程，然后才能上其他课程。

175
So there's two meanings of the word, but they're both related to requirements, what you have to do.
所以这个词有两个含义，但它们都与要求有关，你必须做的事情。

176
Okay, you need a requirement.
好的，你需要一个要求。

177
Now, moving on and talking about the major.
现在，继续谈论专业。

178
He said if, well, if you decided on a major, and he said, well, pre-med.
他说，如果，你决定了一个专业，他说，嗯，预科医学。

179
All right, so major, first of all, is what you choose to study, right?
好的，所以专业，首先，是你选择学习的东西，对吧？

180
The focus of your study.
你学习的重点。

181
Exactly, the focus.
确切地说，重点。

182
You might study other classes, but your focus, your main interest area, is one thing.
你可能会学习其他课程，但你的重点，你的主要兴趣领域，是一件事。

183
And in his case, he's talking about pre-med.
在他的情况下，他谈论的是预科医学。

184
Now, what does pre-med stand for?
现在，预科医学代表什么？

185
Because it is a short version of a longer word.
因为这是一个较长单词的缩写。

186
Right, so it's pre-medicine.
对，所以是预医学。

187
Yeah, okay, so medicine is something you study if you want to be a doctor.
是的，好吧，所以医学是你想成为医生时学习的东西。

188
So pre-, because in America, you don't, you don't become a doctor after four years.
所以预-，因为在美国，你不能在四年后成为医生。

189
Right.
对。

190
You have to go get your BA, your bachelor's degree, and then you have to get your PhD, your doctorate.
你必须获得你的学士学位，然后你必须获得你的博士学位。

191
So people who want to go to graduate school first have to study many required courses.
所以想要上研究生院的人首先必须学习许多必修课程。

192
That's the pre-med focus.
这就是预科医学的重点。

193
Uh -huh.
嗯-huh。

194
Okay, so that's what he's talking about.
好的，所以这就是他所谈论的。

195
He's definitely going to focus on pre-med.
他肯定会专注于预科医学。

196
He wants to be a doctor.
他想成为医生。

197
He's not going to be a doctor soon, but he wants to start studying to be a doctor.
他不会很快成为医生，但他想开始学习成为医生。

198
So he will, he will become a pre-med, a pre-med major.
所以他会，他会成为预科医学专业。

199
And what about for lawyers?
律师呢？

200
I know that there are also something that you focus on before.
我知道在此之前你也有一些专注的东西。

201
There is, yeah, that's called pre-law.
是的，那叫做预法。

202
Same idea.
同样的概念。

203
Pre-means before.
预意味着之前。

204
So obviously, a lawyer needs to study for a long time as well.
显然，律师也需要学习很长时间。

205
And with your undergrad degree, so your first four years, you would study pre-law.
在你的本科学位中，前四年你会学习预法。

206
So this is what you focus on for your four years and then you go into grad school and become an attorney or a specific type of lawyer.
这就是你四年专注的内容，然后你进入研究生院，成为律师或特定类型的律师。

207
But a lawyer doesn't have to study for a PhD.
但律师不需要攻读博士学位。

208
A lawyer studies for a JD.
律师学习的是法学博士。

209
That's JD.
就是JD。

210
Yeah, Juris Doctorate.
是的，法学博士。

211
That's the law degree.
这就是法律学位。

212
Uh -huh, interesting.
嗯，挺有趣的。

213
Okay, so well, he's going into pre-med.
好吧，他要去读预科医学。

214
But the other guy, he's like, well, I don't have a clue yet.
但另一个人，他说，我还没有头绪。

215
And he doesn't have to declare a major until the sophomore year.
他在大二之前不需要确定专业。

216
Okay, a couple things going on here.
好吧，这里有几件事情。

217
First of all, there are different names for each year.
首先，每年有不同的名称。

218
So freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, one, two, three, four.
所以新生、二年级、三年级、四年级，一、二、三、四。

219
So sophomore year is the second year.
所以大二是第二年。

220
So if you say I'm a sophomore student at XY University, that means you're in your second year.
如果你说我是XY大学的二年级学生，那意味着你在第二年。

221
Exactly.
正是如此。

222
And he says that he doesn't have to declare a major until his second year, until his sophomore year.
他表示在第二年之前不需要确定专业。

223
And this phrase, to declare a major, is very important.
而这个短语，确定专业，非常重要。

224
It means that you will tell the university what your focus will be.
这意味着你会告诉大学你的专注领域。

225
Right.
对。

226
And you have to do this.
你必须这样做。

227
You can't just go to school and then graduate.
你不能只是上学然后毕业。

228
You have to say, I will focus on this.
你必须说，我将专注于这个。

229
Because every major has what we just talked about, prerequisites.
因为每个专业都有我们刚才谈到的先决条件。

230
So, but in this first year, you don't have to tell the university yet what you want to study.
但在第一年，你还不需要告诉大学你想学习什么。

231
Maybe you just, you take a variety of courses and then you tell them, okay, now I'm going to focus on this, right?
也许你只是选修各种课程，然后告诉他们，好吧，现在我将专注于这个，对吧？

232
Exactly.
正是如此。

233
That's what I did.
这就是我所做的。

234
And that's very common for liberal arts schools.
这在文科院校中非常普遍。

235
Maybe if you're in a specific trade school or you're in a certain track, you would have a different situation.
也许如果你在特定的职业学校或某个专业轨道上，你会有不同的情况。

236
But for me, liberal arts, I studied history.
但对我来说，文科，我学习了历史。

237
I studied philosophy.
我学习了哲学。

238
I studied language and literature.
我学习了语言和文学。

239
And then my sophomore year, my second year, I decided, oh, I will study philosophy.
然后在我的二年级，我决定，哦，我将学习哲学。

240
So you're going to focus on that.
所以你将专注于这个。

241
Yes, one thing.
是的，一件事。

242
So it's interesting because in many other countries, the education system requires you to declare your major before you start studying, right?
很有趣的是，在许多其他国家，教育系统要求你在开始学习之前确定专业，对吧？

243
You say, well, I'm going to study business and then your four years are around that.
你说，我将学习商业，然后你的四年都是围绕这个。

244
Whereas in some places in the United States or for some majors, you don't have to do that.
而在美国的某些地方或某些专业，你不需要这样做。

245
That's true.
这是真的。

246
And I've also heard in England, for example, you have one area of study, one major.
我还听说在英国，例如，你有一个学习领域，一个专业。

247
And that's all you study.
这就是你所学习的全部。

248
Right, because in the US, you can get a major in history with a minor in philosophy, right?
对，因为在美国，你可以主修历史，辅修哲学，对吧？

249
Exactly.
正是如此。

250
I was the opposite.
我正好相反。

251
I had a major in philosophy and a minor in history.
我主修哲学，辅修历史。

252
So major means something bigger, more important.
所以主修意味着更大、更重要的东西。

253
And minor is smaller or less important.
辅修则是较小或不那么重要的。

254
And a minor is your second field of study.
辅修是你的第二个学习领域。

255
So you take fewer classes, but you still know something about that.
所以你上更少的课，但你仍然对那方面有一定了解。

256
But do they always have to be related?
但它们总是必须相关吗？

257
Because, like, for example, can you be a major of philosophy with a minor in, I don't know, astronomy or something like that?
比如说，你可以主修哲学，辅修，我不知道，天文学或其他什么吗？

258
Something like pre-med, so medicine, it's hard because there's so many requirements.
像预科医学这样的东西，医学很难，因为有很多要求。

259
Right.
对。

260
But I had a number of friends who are majoring in computer science and a minor in literature, for example.
但我有很多朋友主修计算机科学，辅修文学，例如。

261
Really?
真的？

262
So you can mix it up at certain schools.
所以在某些学校你可以混合。

263
So what would be the advantage of that, of doing something like that?
那这样做的好处是什么呢？

264
You know, because most places or most education systems say that you... or teach that, you know, you should specialize, you should be focused on one area.
你知道，因为大多数地方或大多数教育系统说，你应该专注于一个领域。

265
So if you're in computer science, then you should be focused on that.
所以如果你在计算机科学领域，那么你应该专注于这个。

266
So why would somebody specialize in computer science in their major, but then take a minor in, like, literature or something?
那么为什么有人会在主修计算机科学的同时，辅修文学或其他东西呢？

267
Well, let's use that example.
好吧，让我们用这个例子。

268
I think one of the benefits for the liberal arts degree, and this is something they talk about a lot in education, is that you have a broad area of knowledge.
我认为文科教育的一个好处，这在教育中经常被提到，是你拥有广泛的知识领域。

269
So yes, you know a lot about computer science.
所以是的，你对计算机科学了解很多。

270
You have to, to graduate.
你必须这样做才能毕业。

271
But maybe in your future you will write articles about computer science, or you want a blog, or you want a job that has a public relations aspect.
但也许在未来你会写关于计算机科学的文章，或者你想写博客，或者你想要一份有公共关系方面的工作。

272
You need to know how to write.
你需要知道如何写作。

273
Right.
对。

274
And you're not going to learn how to write in all of your computer science classes, but you will by reading a lot and writing a lot in your literature classes.
而你不会在所有计算机科学课程中学会写作，但你会通过阅读和在文学课上写作来学会。

275
Right.
对。

276
So some people like to say that it's very good to mix up business and languages or computer science and literature, because it's a way to be well-rounded.
所以有些人喜欢说，将商业与语言或计算机科学与文学混合是非常好的，因为这是一种全面发展的方式。

277
That's right.
没错。

278
That's actually interesting, because in most places, specifically in the exact sciences fields, they focus more on that, like engineers.
这实际上很有趣，因为在大多数地方，特别是在精确科学领域，他们更专注于这一点，比如工程师。

279
It's all about engineering, math, and all this.
一切都与工程、数学等有关。

280
But the human aspect, like you said, or the liberal arts aspect, like literature or history, they don't get much of that.
但人文方面，比如你所说的，或文科方面，比如文学或历史，他们并没有太多接触。

281
So when you actually have to become a manager or write or manage people, you don't really have the skills to do that, because you never really took a class.
所以当你实际上需要成为经理或写作或管理人员时，你并没有真正的技能，因为你从未上过相关课程。

282
That's right.
没错。

283
And it can be very hard to learn how to write well and to speak well all of a sudden, you know?
突然间学会写得很好和说得很好可能非常困难，你知道吗？

284
And I think that's where people struggle also when they're applying for jobs.
我认为这也是人们在申请工作时遇到的困难。

285
So I don't know.
所以我不知道。

286
I believe in being a well-rounded individual.
我相信成为一个全面发展的人。

287
Obviously, there's some benefits to being very, very knowledgeable about one thing.
显然，深入了解一件事情是有一些好处的。

288
So I guess we could ask you guys, our users, do you believe that it's better to be knowledgeable about one thing or maybe more well-rounded and to be an expert in many different things?
所以我想我们可以问问你们，用户们，你们认为了解一件事情更好，还是更全面，成为多方面的专家更好？

289
That's right.
没错。

290
Yeah, you should let us know.
是的，你应该告诉我们。

291
Let's jump into our dialogue one last time.
让我们最后再回顾一下我们的对话。

292
Let's take a look at what everyone was saying, and we'll be back in a bit.

295
It's totally cliche, but really, I think it's been a good decision.

296
Got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys.

303
The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count.
指导顾问建议我专注于我的先修课程，以确保学分有效。

304
That sounds smart, but kind of boring.
听起来聪明，但有点无聊。

Yeah, it is.

A little bit.

现在我发现的一个有趣的事情是，拉丁美洲的教育系统有点独特，人们实际上可以上五年的大学，专业如商业。

335
And what they do is they call it a commercial engineer.

336
So it's like an engineering major, but it's not really engineering because it's business.
