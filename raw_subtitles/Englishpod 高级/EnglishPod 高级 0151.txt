It's about a very controversial topic and a very popular person in history, Charles Darwin.
这是一个非常有争议的话题，关于历史上一个非常著名的人，查尔斯·达尔文。

8
That's right.
没错。

9
So he's most famous perhaps for his book, The Origin of the Species.
他最著名的可能是他的书《物种起源》。

10
And we're going to be talking a lot about science today.
今天我们将讨论很多科学内容。

11
So put your thinking caps on.

12
All right.
好的。

13
So without further ado, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time.

I'm up to my neck in work, but at least we've got summer holidays after finals.
我忙得不可开交，但至少期末考试后我们有暑假。

19
Where are you headed now?

20
I'm going to my anthro class.
我去上人类学课。

21
We've been focusing on Darwin all term since it's the 200th anniversary of his birth or whatever.
这学期我们一直在关注达尔文，因为这是他诞辰200周年。

22
I'm sick and tired of Darwin, Darwin, Darwin.

23
What?

25
How can you not like Darwin?

26
His work turned thousands of years of ideas about creation on their head.
他的工作颠覆了数千年来关于创造的观念。

27
His theory of evolution revolutionized the fields of biology and anthropology.
他的进化论彻底改变了生物学和人类学领域。

28
I don't like him.
我不喜欢他。

29
His theory of human evolution and natural selection is full of holes.
他的关于人类进化和自然选择的理论漏洞百出。

30
It's not as solid as you make it out to be.
这并不像你说的那么坚实。

31
Say that again and you'll make enemies with half of the academy, not to mention your professors.
再说一次，你会和一半的学术界结仇，更不用说你的教授了。

32
Furthermore, the explanation proposed by Darwin about the origin of the species and the process of natural selection constitutes a grand step towards a coherent understanding of the world and its very beginnings.
此外，达尔文关于物种起源和自然选择过程的解释是理解世界及其起源的重要一步。

33
I'm not minimizing his huge contributions to science.
我并不是在贬低他对科学的巨大贡献。

34
It's just that his theory reminds me of the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.

35
What are you talking about?
你在说什么？

36
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?

38
How did the very first living organism come to be?
第一个生物是如何产生的？

39
Interesting.
有趣。

40
I think that question is better suited for my philosophy class.
我觉得这个问题更适合我的哲学课。

41
In the meantime, how about we settle this with a duel?

42
All right, interesting.
好的，有趣。

43
They have very different views on Charles Darwin, right?
他们对查尔斯·达尔文的看法非常不同，对吧？

44
They do, and they're both pretty nerdy people.
是的，他们都是非常书呆子的人。

45
This is a very nerdy university conversation that's happening between classes.
这是在课间发生的非常书呆子的大学对话。

46
Yeah, I think maybe they're like PhD candidates or something.
是的，我觉得他们可能是博士候选人之类的。

47
Perhaps.
也许吧。

48
All right, so before we get to talking about some of the ideas in today's dialogue, let's talk about some of the words and phrases that we hear to understand better what's going on.
好的，在我们讨论今天对话中的一些观点之前，先来谈谈我们听到的一些单词和短语，以更好地理解发生了什么。

49
The first part we're going to talk about in today's Language Takeaway.

50
Language Takeaway.
语言要点。

51
All right, on Language Takeaway today, let's take a look at the first word.
好的，今天的语言要点，我们先来看第一个单词。

52
And, well, one of the things that many people say is that Darwin revolutionized the fields of biology.
许多人说达尔文彻底改变了生物学领域。

53
And so he revolutionized these because he pushed them forward.
他之所以能改变这些，是因为他推动了它们的发展。

54
He made many changes.
他做了许多改变。

55
He forced changes.
他强迫改变。

56
So people had to change the way that they thought about these things.
所以人们不得不改变他们对这些事物的看法。

57
If you revolutionize something, a topic, or an idea, you are creating new knowledge almost, right?
如果你彻底改变某个主题或想法，你几乎是在创造新的知识，对吧？

58
Exactly.
没错。

59
You can think of the word revolution, which is a thing.
你可以想到“革命”这个词，这是一个事物。

60
So you think of the Russian Revolution or the American Revolution.
所以你可以想到俄国革命或美国革命。

61
These are times of change.
这些都是变革的时代。

62
So to revolutionize is to bring about change.
所以“革命化”就是带来变化。

63
Very good.
非常好。

64
All right, so moving forward, they were talking about human evolution.
好的，接下来，他们在谈论人类进化。

65
Human evolution.
人类进化。

66
What is that exactly?
这到底是什么？

67
Good question.
好问题。

68
So you're not a monkey, I'm not a monkey, but we come from monkeys, right?
所以你不是猴子，我也不是猴子，但我们来自猴子，对吧？

69
So we evolved.
所以我们进化了。

70
Right.
对。

71
So the process is called human evolution.
所以这个过程叫做人类进化。

72
That means the process by which humans changed forms to become what we are today.
这意味着人类改变形态成为我们今天的样子。

73
Okay, so you evolve.
好的，所以你进化了。

74
Now, is it evolution?
现在，进化是吗？

75
You usually think of something positive, right?
你通常会认为这是积极的，对吧？

76
Something evolves into something better.
某种东西进化成更好的东西。

77
Is it always that way?
一直都是这样吗？

78
No, we have another word for the negative, right?
不，我们还有另一个词用于消极的，对吧？

79
So the positive is to evolve, to become better.
所以积极的是进化，变得更好。

80
To get worse is to devolve.
变得更糟是退化。

81
Okay.
好的。

82
To devolve.
退化。

83
To go back and to kind of lose things that you had.
回到过去，失去你曾经拥有的东西。

84
Okay, interesting.
好的，有趣。

85
And then they were also talking about Darwin's theory of natural selection.
然后他们还在谈论达尔文的自然选择理论。

86
Natural selection.
自然选择。

87
Okay, this is maybe one of the things that Darwin was most famous for, and that's why we've included it in this language takeaway, because it's a key phrase.
好的，这可能是达尔文最著名的事情之一，这就是我们将其包含在这个语言要点中的原因，因为这是一个关键短语。

88
It's something you hear people talk about a lot.
这是人们经常谈论的内容。

89
Okay, so natural selection is a process again, and it's the process by which stronger animals survive over time and weaker animals don't.
好的，自然选择又是一个过程，是强壮的动物在时间中生存，而弱小的动物则不生存的过程。

90
So if there's a weak species, it can't really survive because it keeps dying and dying, and then finally there's no more.
所以如果有一个弱小的物种，它实际上无法生存，因为它不断死亡，最后就没有了。

91
And so this is called natural selection because no one's actually choosing what animals will survive, but it's kind of a natural process.
所以这被称为自然选择，因为没有人真正选择哪些动物会生存，但这是一种自然过程。

92
Right, Mother Nature is choosing it.
对，母自然在选择。

93
Right.
对。

94
Very good, so natural selection.
非常好，所以自然选择。

95
This is one of the things that Darwin is most famous for.
这是达尔文最著名的事情之一。

96
And well, as Catherine mentioned, Darwin wrote the book Origin of the Species.
而且，正如Catherine提到的，达尔文写了《物种起源》这本书。

97
Right, so origin means beginning.
没错，所以“起源”意味着开始。

98
So the origin of mankind, right?
所以人类的起源，对吧？

99
So there are many different kinds of animals.
所以有许多不同种类的动物。

100
You could even say there are many different kinds of like mammals, but there are many different species within that.
你甚至可以说有许多不同种类的哺乳动物，但在其中有许多不同的物种。

101
So human beings, black bears, koalas, chimpanzees, these are all species.
所以人类、黑熊、考拉、黑猩猩，这些都是物种。

102
And so a species is a classification.
所以物种是一种分类。

103
So the origin of the species is kind of a way of telling the story of how all these things came about.
所以物种的起源是一种讲述这些事物如何产生的方式。

104
All right, the origin of the species.
好的，物种的起源。

105
And the last one, this word is kind of strange.
最后一个，这个词有点奇怪。

106

110
It means like a problem or a riddle or something that's hard to understand.

112
Which came first?

113
How else can you use conundrum?

This is quite a conundrum.
这真是个难题。

120
All right, so interesting words on language takeaway.

你说，我工作忙得不可开交。

128
Well, I'm up to my neck in papers to write.

129
All right, so this means I have so much stuff to do that you could pile it up and it would come up to my neck.
好的，这意味着我有太多事情要做，堆起来会到我的脖子。

130
So I have as many papers that are almost as tall as I am.
所以我有的论文几乎和我一样高。

131
Exactly.
正是如此。

132
And so I could say I'm up to my neck in work.
所以我可以说我工作忙得不可开交。

133
I have no more time to do anything.
我没有时间做其他事情。

134
Sometimes people also say I'm up to here and then they'll point at their forehead or somewhere around their head.

135

139
I'm really tired of it.
我真的厌倦了。

我们下一个短语是大多数母亲会用的。

142

He said, the sentence went like this.

161
His work turned thousands of years of ideas about creation on their head.

Like you said, Marco, it's split into two parts.
就像你说的，Marco，它分为两部分。

167
Okay.

168
And so if biology used to be one way, then Darwin made it completely different.
所以如果生物学曾经是某种方式，那么达尔文使其完全不同。

169
So we can say that Isaac Newton completely turned physics on its head with his theory or his findings on gravity.
所以我们可以说，艾萨克·牛顿用他的理论或关于重力的发现完全颠覆了物理学。

170
And then years and years later, we had Albert Einstein who turned those theories or who turned that theory on its head with his own ideas about physics.
然后多年以后，我们有阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦，他用自己关于物理学的想法颠覆了那些理论。

171
Very good.
非常好。

172
So to come to turn something on its head, completely change the course of or prove something to be maybe wrong.
所以颠覆某事，完全改变某事的方向或证明某事可能是错误的。

173
And the last phrase that we have is the person argued that Darwin's theories were full of holes.
我们最后一个短语是这个人争辩说达尔文的理论漏洞百出。

174
Okay.
好的。

175
So to say a theory is full of holes is a little bit different than saying that his pants are full of holes.
所以说一个理论漏洞百出与说他的裤子漏洞百出有点不同。

176
Because when you say something is full of holes, maybe they actually have holes, but a theory is it's an idea.
因为当你说某事漏洞百出时，可能它们确实有漏洞，但理论是一个想法。

177
So it can't have holes.

178
What you're saying is that it's not completely sound.
你所说的是它并不完全可靠。

And so maybe you're saying that, um, well, the cookies are gone out of the kitchen, Marco.
所以也许你在说，嗯，饼干从厨房里没了，Marco。

181
And I saw you in the kitchen, so clearly you ate the cookies.
而我看到你在厨房，所以显然是你吃了饼干。

182
Right.
对。

183
So I can say that's full of holes because it was me and it was three other people who were in the kitchen.
所以我可以说这漏洞百出，因为是我和另外三个人在厨房。

184
So you can't blame me.
所以你不能怪我。

185
Ah, could have been the other two people.
啊，可能是其他两个人。

186
Right.
对。

187
So if something is full of holes, it's that it has maybe mistakes or it's still missing complete evidence to prove it right.
所以如果某事漏洞百出，那就是它可能有错误，或者仍然缺乏完整的证据来证明它是正确的。

188
Or it has bad logic.
或者它有糟糕的逻辑。

189
Bad logic.
糟糕的逻辑。

211
It's not as solid as you make it out to be.
这并不像你说的那么扎实。

212
Save that again and you'll make enemies with half of the academy, not to mention your professors.
再这样说，你会和一半的学术界结仇，更不用说你的教授了。

213
Furthermore, the explanation proposed by Darwin about the origin of the species and the process of natural selection constitutes a grand step towards a coherent understanding of the world and its very beginnings.
此外，达尔文关于物种起源和自然选择过程的解释是理解世界及其起源的重要一步。

214
I'm not minimizing his huge contributions to science.
我并不是在贬低他对科学的巨大贡献。

215
It's just that his theory reminds me of the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.
只是他的理论让我想起了鸡和蛋的难题。

216
What are you talking about?
你在说什么？

217
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?

All right, we're back.
好吧，我们回来了。

224
So interesting, this Darwin's theories and his explanations for the origin of species and life as we know it.
达尔文的理论以及他对物种和生命起源的解释真有趣。

225
But there is the opposite to this, right?
但这有相反的观点，对吧？

226
There is a certain thing called creationism.
有一种叫做创造论的东西。

227
There is, and this is a big source of controversy, especially in the United States, because in some places people want to teach creationism as well as evolution in schools.
确实有，这在美国尤其引发了很大争议，因为在某些地方，人们希望在学校教授创造论和进化论。

228
And so this is the big question.
所以这是一个大问题。

229
Are they still equal as theories, or is one theory more proven than the other?
这两种理论仍然平等吗，还是其中一种理论更有证据？

230
Right, and it is kind of hard to determine which one is better, because one is based on faith, the other one is based more on scientific evidence, right?
对，而且很难判断哪一个更好，因为一个基于信仰，另一个更基于科学证据，对吧？

231
So they're not really even on the same scale.
所以它们实际上并不在同一尺度上。

232
As we learned before, that's kind of like apples and oranges, right?
正如我们之前所学的，这就像苹果和橘子，对吧？

233
It is, and there are some people who would say that we have lots of ways of proving what happened in the past, but as long as we weren't there, we never really do know.
是的，有些人会说我们有很多方法来证明过去发生的事情，但只要我们不在场，我们就永远无法真正知道。

234
And there's always changes in science, so how can we be sure that what we know now isn't false, isn't misunderstandings?
而且科学总是会变化，那么我们怎么能确定我们现在所知道的不是错误的，不是误解呢？

235
Right, I think for now this is the best explanation, but that doesn't mean that it's the correct one.
对，我认为目前这是最好的解释，但这并不意味着它是正确的。

236
Maybe in a hundred years from now we'll have another explanation that's much better or maybe complementary to this one.
也许一百年后我们会有一个更好的解释，或者与这个解释互补。

237
Well, we want to know what you guys think.
好吧，我们想知道你们的想法。

238
Come to our website, EnglishPod.com.

It is a little bit controversial, so we really look forward to your comments and any other questions you may have.

242
Yep, and just a reference, creationism is the idea that God created the world, or a superior being created the world, and that everything came from that.
是的，作为参考，创造论是上帝创造了世界，或者一个更高的存在创造了世界，所有事物都源于此的观点。

243
And so let us know what you think.
所以让我们知道你们的想法。

244
I am very curious too.
