103
That means that they were humans, but something changed in them, and it makes them have these special powers.
这意味着他们曾经是人类，但他们身上发生了变化，使他们拥有这些特殊的能力。

104
So a mutant is maybe a person that has special powers, like as you say Wolverine and all these types of X-Men.
所以变种人可能是拥有特殊能力的人，就像你说的金刚狼和所有这些类型的X战警。

105
But I guess taking maybe a look at the verb mutate, that means to change.
但我想看看动词“变异”，这意味着改变。

106
To change, right.
改变，对。

107
Okay, so to mutate is to change.

177
Okay, so the first phrase here in Fluency Builder is a really important one for anyone who's buying anything because you often see this phrase on packages or you hear it in commercials.
好的，所以流利构建者中的第一个短语对任何购买东西的人来说都非常重要，因为你经常在包装上看到这个短语，或者在广告中听到。

Right, as you saw in the Play-Doh commercial, the guy said, treasure chest sold separately.
对，就像你在Play-Doh广告中看到的，那个家伙说，宝箱单独出售。

179

180
That means the treasure chest is not included.

181
You have to buy it extra.

182
As you say, you usually see it in packaging as well.
正如你所说，你通常也会在包装上看到它。

183
Maybe you buy a toy car.

184
And at the bottom, it will say, batteries sold separately.
在底部，它会写着，电池单独出售。

185
That means there are no batteries in the box.
这意味着盒子里没有电池。

186
You have to buy batteries extra.
你必须额外购买电池。

187
Exactly.

188
So that's what the phrase, sold separately, means.
所以这就是“单独出售”这个短语的意思。

189
It indicates that it's not included in the product that you are buying.
它表示不包括在你购买的产品中。

190
All right, now moving on again to the action figures and the dolls.
好的，现在再次继续谈论动作玩偶和娃娃。

191
We saw this very interesting way of describing them.
我们看到了一种非常有趣的描述方式。

192
For example, the action figure said, special edition collectible X-Men action figures.
例如，动作玩偶说，特别版收藏X战警动作玩偶。

193
Okay, special edition.
好的，特别版。

194
This is really important.
这真的很重要。

195
And it's very common, I think, with special toys or action figures or even baseball cards.
我认为这在特别玩具、动作玩偶甚至棒球卡中都很常见。

196
Special edition means that they're produced specially on one occasion, at one time.
特别版意味着它们是在某个特定场合、某个时间特别生产的。

197
They're not always produced.
它们并不是总是生产的。

198
So for example, if you have, like you say, baseball cards or maybe action figures, they're produced normally, but then a limited amount, a special type of the same action figure will be produced.
所以例如，如果你有棒球卡或动作玩偶，它们通常是正常生产的，但会生产有限数量的同款特别版动作玩偶。

199
So that's a special edition or also commonly known as a collector's edition.
所以这就是特别版，通常也被称为收藏版。

200
All right, so some people collect stamps, you know, stamps for letters that you send.
好吧，有些人收集邮票，你知道的，就是你寄信用的邮票。

201
And I know many countries, like America, offer special edition or collector's edition stamps.
我知道很多国家，比如美国，提供特别版或收藏版邮票。

202
These are produced once and usually they Mark a special occasion.
这些邮票通常只生产一次，通常标志着一个特殊的场合。

203
Like the Olympics in 1996, we had special edition stamps.
比如1996年的奥运会，我们有特别版邮票。

204
Right, so these special edition objects are usually not used.
对，所以这些特别版物品通常不被使用。

205
They're for collectors, like the name says, right, collector's edition.
它们是给收藏家的，正如名字所说，收藏版。

206
Right, so you plan to sell them later on, or you collect them for yourself.
对，所以你计划以后出售它们，或者为自己收藏。

207
They're not normal.
它们不是普通的。

208
Right, they usually go up in value because they're very limited.
对，它们通常会增值，因为数量非常有限。

209
That's right.
没错。

210
Okay, so collector's edition, special edition.
好的，所以收藏版，特别版。

211
And now when they were talking about the porcelain dolls, as well, it's pretty expensive, right?
现在当他们谈论瓷娃娃时，这个也很贵，对吧？

212
Almost $200.
几乎200美元。

213
That's a really expensive doll.
这真的是个很贵的娃娃。

214
And so one of the kids said, you know what?
所以有一个孩子说，你知道吗？

215
I think mom and dad won't buy you that because it costs a pretty penny.
我觉得爸爸妈妈不会给你买这个，因为它太贵了。

216
A pretty penny.
太贵了。

217
This does not mean that the penny is beautiful.
这并不意味着一分钱是美丽的。

218
Right, a penny is a one cent coin in the United States.
对，一分钱是美国的一种一美分硬币。

219
That means it's very, very low in value, the coin.
这意味着它的价值非常低。

220
But a pretty penny is actually the opposite.
但“太贵了”实际上是相反的意思。

221
It means it's very expensive.
它意味着非常昂贵。

222
So why would, how would you use this in another, in another example?
那么你会如何在另一个例子中使用这个呢？

223
I've always wanted to buy a Ferrari, but man, Ferraris cost a pretty penny.
我一直想买一辆法拉利，但法拉利真的很贵。

224
Okay, so you have to add the word cost before you say pretty penny, right?
好的，所以你必须在说“太贵了”之前加上“成本”这个词，对吧？

225
That's right.
没错。

226
You can't say it is a pretty penny.
你不能说“这是太贵了”。

227
You have to say it costs a pretty penny.
你必须说“它的成本很高”。

228
Or it's worth a pretty penny.
或者“它值很多钱”。

229
Exactly.
正是如此。

230
It's worth a pretty penny.
它值很多钱。

231
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

232
And for our last phrase, I think this one is a very good phrase because it describes a lot of different toys that glow in the dark, glow in the dark toys.
对于我们的最后一句话，我认为这句话非常好，因为它描述了许多不同的夜光玩具。

233
Okay, so something that glows in the dark, the verb here is to glow, means that it can be seen even when it's dark.
好的，夜光的东西，动词是“发光”，意味着即使在黑暗中也能被看到。

234
Right.
对。

235
So for example, when I turn the lights off and I can see this yo-yo in my room, that means it's glow in the dark.
例如，当我关灯时，我可以在我的房间里看到这个悠悠球，这意味着它是夜光的。

236
It has light even in the dark.
它在黑暗中也有光。

237
Right, so there are a lot of different toys and things like this.
对，所以有很多不同的玩具和这样的东西。

238
Usually glow in the dark toys, they have a green glow, right?
通常夜光玩具，它们在黑暗中呈绿色光芒，对吧？

239
They look green in the dark.
它们在黑暗中看起来是绿色的。

240
I used to have stars.
我以前有星星。

241
So they were stickers, star stickers, and I put them on my ceiling so that when I was in bed, I could look at them and they were glow in the dark.
所以它们是贴纸，星星贴纸，我把它们贴在天花板上，这样当我在床上时，我可以看着它们，它们是夜光的。

242
So when the lights were off, I still had stars.
所以当灯关掉时，我仍然有星星。

243
You can still see them, right?
你仍然可以看到它们，对吧？

244
So yeah, glow in the dark.
所以是的，夜光。

245
It's a way of describing an item, an object that you are able to see in the dark.
这是描述一个物品、一个你能在黑暗中看到的物体的方式。

246
All right, so that's all we have for you on language.
好的，这就是我们关于语言的全部内容。

247
All right, so that's all we have for you on Fluency Builder.
好的，这就是我们关于流利度提升的全部内容。

248
