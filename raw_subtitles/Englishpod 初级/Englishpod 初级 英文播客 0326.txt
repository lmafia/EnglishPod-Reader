Today we're going to take a look at a child's report card.
今天我们要看看一个孩子的成绩单。

7
So we're going to talk a little bit about what this means, what is a report card, and also everything that's inside this report.

Let's take a listen to our dialogue, and we'll be back in a minute to discuss the meaning of some of these words and phrases.

13
Look, Jimmy's report card came today.

14
Let's have a look.

17
He's in the third grade, Sam.
他在三年级，Sam。

18
You see, under each subject that he's being taught in school, he receives a Mark from one to three.
你看，在每个学科下，他会得到一个从一到三的分数。

19
A one means his achievement or work is excellent.
一分意味着他的成绩或工作非常优秀。

20
Here in science, for example, he got a two, which means it's satisfactory.
比如在科学课上，他得了二分，这意味着满意。

21
What about here in physical education?
那在体育课上呢？

22
He got a three here, which means it's unsatisfactory.
他得了三分，这意味着不满意。

23
We should work on that with him.
我们应该和他一起努力。

24
So confusing.
真让人困惑。

25
In my day, we got an A or a B if we were doing well, and if we failed an exam, we would get an F.
在我那个年代，如果我们表现好就会得到A或B，如果考试不及格，就会得到F。

26
All right, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

27
So now let's start with some language takeaway.
现在让我们开始一些语言要点。

28
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

29
All right, the first phrase here we have in language takeaway is actually a thing.
好的，语言要点中的第一个短语实际上是一个东西。

30
It's the report card, and this is the topic of today's dialogue.
它是成绩单，这是今天对话的主题。

31
That's right.
没错。

32
Now you may remember, I'm sure, pretty much it's standard everywhere in the world.
现在你可能记得，这在世界各地几乎是标准的。

33
You get a report, a small little report that tells your parents how well or how poorly you are doing in school.
你会收到一份小报告，告诉你的父母你在学校的表现好坏。

34
That's right.
没错。

35
So after maybe two or three months, your teacher will write down how she or he thinks that you're performing at school.
所以在两三个月后，你的老师会写下她或他认为你在学校的表现。

36
That's right.
没错。

37
And usually parents have to sign this.
通常父母需要签字。

38
They have to say, okay, I see that my child is doing well or that he's doing poorly, and then the teacher will know as well.
他们需要说，好吧，我看到我的孩子表现良好或不佳，然后老师也会知道。

39
And I think, well, you get report cards in elementary school, in high school, and also in university, right?
我认为，你在小学、高中和大学都会收到成绩单，对吧？

40
You do get a report card of some sort.
你确实会收到某种形式的成绩单。

41
That's right.
没错。

42
Well, in university in America, we call them grades.
在美国的大学，我们称之为成绩。

43
We don't really call them a report card.
我们不太称它为成绩单。

44
In high school, middle school, and elementary school, so before college, we actually have a piece of paper.
在高中、初中和小学，也就是大学之前，我们实际上有一张纸。

45
And that's why it's called a card.
这就是为什么它叫做成绩单。

46
Yeah, that's right.
是的，没错。

47
I think now for universities especially, you just go online and you see your grades.
我认为现在特别是大学，你只需上网就能看到你的成绩。

48
That's right.
没错。

49
It's on the Internet.
它在互联网上。

50
But the important thing about the report card is that it tells a parent and a student what his or her grades are.
但成绩单的重要性在于它告诉父母和学生他或她的成绩。

51
That's right.
没错。

52
So the grades, this is a noun, is basically your score.
所以成绩，这个名词，基本上就是你的分数。

53
That's right.
没错。

54
So maybe you took a test and you did very well on your test, and you had some homework, and you did very well on your homework, so you have a good grade.
所以也许你参加了考试，表现很好，还有一些作业，你也做得很好，所以你得了好成绩。

55
That's right.
没错。

56
But if you don't do your homework and you don't do well on your test, you have a bad grade.
但如果你不做作业，考试也不及格，你就会得到坏成绩。

57
That's right.
没错。

58
So for example, like in the United States, it's over 100 points.
例如，在美国，满分是100分。

59
So maybe a good grade would be 95 points out of 100.
所以一个好成绩可能是100分中的95分。

60
So we call that an A.
我们称之为A。

61
That's called an A, that's right.
这叫做A，没错。

62
Or if you have a bad grade, maybe that's an F, which is 20% or 30%.
或者如果你有一个坏成绩，可能是F，20%或30%。

63
Right.
对。

64
Okay, so now this is where we need to make a difference between the grades that his father was looking for, and then the mom says he's in the third grade.
好的，现在我们需要区分他父亲所寻找的成绩和妈妈说的他在三年级。

65
So it's very different between having good grades or bad grades and fifth grade or third grade.
所以好成绩和坏成绩与三年级和五年级是非常不同的。

66
All right, two different grades, and we know this is confusing.
好的，两种不同的成绩，我们知道这很困惑。

67
So we want to explain a little bit.
所以我们想稍微解释一下。

68
Third grade is actually the third year of elementary school.
三年级实际上是小学的第三年。

69
That's right.
没错。

70
So in the American education system, we start in kindergarten.
在美国教育系统中，我们从幼儿园开始。

71
And we have first grade, second grade, third grade, all the way up until the end, which is 12th grade.
然后是一年级、二年级、三年级，一直到最后的十二年级。

72
That's right.
没错。

73
So that's everything between when you're five years old and when you're 18 years old.
所以这就是你五岁到十八岁之间的所有年级。

74
And each year at school is a grade, a level.
每年在学校都是一个年级，一个级别。

75
That's right.
没错。

76
So as you said, it's a grade in different parts of the country.
正如你所说，这是不同地区的年级。

77
I'm not really sure if they call them a grades or they have the same system.
我不太确定他们是否称之为年级，或者是否有相同的系统。

78
But basically, that's what it means in English.
但基本上，这就是它在英语中的意思。

79
You have first grade, third grade, 12th grade, finally, when you graduate.
你有一年级、三年级、十二年级，最后毕业。

80
That's right.
没错。

81
So you can say, my son is in eighth grade.
所以你可以说，我的儿子在八年级。

82
That means he's in his eighth year of school.
这意味着他在上学的第八年。

83
Right.
对。

84
Very good.
非常好。

85
So that is the difference.
所以这就是区别。

86
And now we're going to take a look at something that has to do with grades as well, is the marks that you get in your test or in your report card.
现在我们要看看与成绩有关的东西，就是你在考试或成绩单上得到的分数。

87
That's right.
没错。

88
So this might actually help.
所以这可能会有所帮助。

89
Remember when we said on your report card, your teacher might write down your grade.
记得我们说过在你的成绩单上，你的老师可能会写下你的成绩。

90
That means, do you have an A or a B or a C?
这意味着你有A、B还是C？

91
Well, another way to call this is a Mark.
另一种称呼是分数。

92
So he has good marks.
所以他有好分数。

93
He has good grades.
他有好成绩。

94
So they're basically the same thing, grades and marks.
所以它们基本上是一样的，成绩和分数。

95
That's right.
没错。

96
They are.
是的。

97
And I know that in Britain, I think people more commonly say marks.
我知道在英国，人们更常说分数。

98
She got terrible marks at school and her father was angry with her.
她在学校得了糟糕的分数，她的父亲对她很生气。

99
But in America, we often say, you know, if you get good grades, I'll buy you sweets.
但在美国，我们常常说，如果你得了好成绩，我就给你买糖果。

100
That's right.
没错。

101
Okay.
好的。

102
So you get a prize if you get good grades, usually.
所以如果你得了好成绩，通常会得到奖励。

103
Well, it depends on your parents.
嗯，这要看你的父母。

104
That's right.
没错。

105
Now, as we said, you can have a grade that's usually a number or a letter like A, B, C, D, F, but you can also get marks that are just very much black or white.
现在，正如我们所说，你可以有一个通常是数字或字母的成绩，比如A、B、C、D、F，但你也可以得到分数，这些分数通常是黑白分明的。

106
It's satisfactory or unsatisfactory, like in this case.
这是合格或不合格，就像在这种情况下。

107
That's right.
没错。

108
So satisfactory, this is an adjective.
所以合格，这是一个形容词。

109
It describes something is a good thing.
它描述某事是好事。

110
So how did he do?
那么他表现得怎么样？

111
Well, his performance was satisfactory.
嗯，他的表现是合格的。

112
It's okay.
还不错。

113
But if it's bad or if it's not good, we call it unsatisfactory.
但如果不好或不合格，我们称之为不合格。

114
That's right.
没错。

115
So this doesn't really have a number, as you can tell.
所以这实际上没有数字，正如你所看到的。

116
It's just basically pass or fail.
基本上就是及格或不及格。

117
That's about it.
就是这样。

118
Good or bad.
好或坏。

119
Good or bad, that's it.
好或坏，就是这样。

120
Exactly.
正是。

121

And we'll explain this in a minute.

124
And that's why we have this satisfactory, unsatisfactory.
