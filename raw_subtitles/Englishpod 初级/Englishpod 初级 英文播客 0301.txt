28
That's right so if anyone knows about the movie Twilight it's mostly about vampires.

A wolf is an animal but a werewolf is a man or woman who turns into an animal when the moon is full.

Right so you are a man or a woman by day but then at night when there is a full moon you transform into a wolf so you are a werewolf.

40
And we have one other kind of monster here this is a very disgusting kind of monster called a zombie.

41
Alright also very popular in the movies you have zombies so they're people who are dead but they're still alive.

没错，他们不能思考，他们只想吃其他人，通常非常愚蠢，你必须砍掉他们的头才能杀死他们。

43
That's right so zombies are also a very popular type of creature in this movie so we have three creatures vampires werewolves and zombies.
没错，所以僵尸也是这部电影中非常受欢迎的生物，我们有三种生物：吸血鬼、狼人和僵尸。

44
But now let's move on to some of the other vocab that we found when the friend was explaining about the movie and how it's very cool.
但现在让我们继续看看朋友在解释电影时提到的其他词汇，以及它是多么酷。

45
She said that the cast is hip.
她说演员阵容很酷。

46
Okay so something that is hip is also very cool.

So a hip person is someone who is really interesting or cool or maybe up to date current.

48
Very popular.

49
So for example you can also talk about a place a restaurant or a club as being very hip.

没错，所以你可以说现在喇叭裤不再时尚了。

51
They were hip in the 1970s.
它们在1970年代是时尚的。

52
That's right so they're not cool they're not popular they're not up to date.

Now moving on to the end of that paragraph we see that the explanation continued in saying that the movie makes it even more enticing having a hip cast and a sexy theme.
现在回到那段话的结尾，我们看到解释继续说这部电影因为有一个酷的演员阵容和性感的主题而更加吸引人。

60
Alright and our last word for language takeaway when the friend was kind of skeptical and said you know what I think it's just a fad.
好吧，我们的最后一个词是当朋友有点怀疑时说的，你知道我觉得这只是一个潮流。

61
Okay something is a fad if it is a passing trend.
