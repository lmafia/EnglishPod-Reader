So, oh, he's growing a stache.

189
So today in Fluency Builder, we are not really talking about phrases as much as talking about adjectives, so words you can use to describe facial hair.
所以今天在流利表达中，我们并不是在谈短语，而是在谈形容词，所以你可以用来描述面部毛发的词。

190
Okay.
好的。

191
So when the girl was describing facial hair, for example, she said the mustache was very short and thin.
所以当女孩描述面部毛发时，例如，她说小胡子非常短而细。

192
Okay.
好的。

193
A short and thin mustache.
一根短而细的小胡子。

194
So you think about it, you can have a very thick mustache.
所以你想想，你可以有一根非常厚的小胡子。

195
That's the opposite.
这正好相反。

196
That means very hairy, very wide.
这意味着非常多毛，非常宽。

197
A thin mustache is like a line.
细胡子就像一条线。

198
Okay.
好的。

199
Okay.
好的。

200
So for example, Charlie Chaplin, he had a short mustache, but it wasn't thin.
例如，查理·卓别林，他有一个短胡子，但并不细。

201
It was a little bit thick.
它有点厚。

202
That's right.
没错。

203
It was kind of wide.
它有点宽。

204
But you think of, you know, when you see someone who's drawing a mustache on a sign at a restaurant or in a newspaper, that's usually very thin.
但你想想，当你看到有人在餐馆的标志或报纸上画胡子时，通常是非常细的。

205
Right.
对。

206
Because they use a pen.
因为他们用的是笔。

207
Exactly.
正是如此。

208
It's very silly looking.
看起来非常傻。

209
Right.
对。

210
So those are different adjectives to describe, not only a mustache.
所以这些是描述面部毛发的不同形容词。

211
So basically we can use these to describe any sort of hair.
基本上我们可以用这些来描述任何类型的毛发。

212
For example, the hair on your head.
例如，头上的毛发。

213
You can say he's got short hair.
你可以说他有短发。

214
That's right.
没错。

215
Or I could say I have long hair.
或者我可以说我有长发。

216
Long hair.

217
Or Mark, I could say you have thick hair.
或者马克，我可以说你有浓密的头发。

218
Thick.
浓密。

219
Yeah.
是的。

220
So if you have an abundance of hair that you would say it's thick.
所以如果你有很多头发，你可以说它是浓密的。

221
That's right.
没错。

222
There's a, you know, it's like if you put your hand in it, it's very, it feels like there's a lot that's very thick hair.
就是说，如果你把手放进去，感觉有很多，非常浓密的头发。

223
Okay.
好的。

224
Some people have thin hair, so they don't have a lot of hair.
有些人有细发，所以他们的头发不多。

225
Okay.
好的。

226
Good.
好的。

227
And well, moving on to the parts of the face.
那么，继续谈论面部的部分。

228
We described it before as to where a mustache is, where a goatee is.
我们之前描述了胡子的位置，山羊胡的位置。

229
But let's take a closer look at that.
但让我们仔细看看。

230
For example, a mustache is on your upper lip.
例如，胡子在你的上唇上。

231
Right.
对。

232
So just above your lip, under your nose, that's where a mustache goes.
所以就在你的嘴唇上方，鼻子下方，那就是胡子的位置。

233
So that's the upper lip.
所以那是上唇。

234
But if we're talking about a goatee, it's not just on your upper lip.
但如果我们谈论山羊胡，它不仅仅在你的上唇上。

235
It's also where?
还在哪里？

236
On your chin.
在你的下巴上。

237
Your chin.
你的下巴。

238
So that's the very bottom point of your face.
所以那是你脸的最底部。

239
So you have your chin, your upper lip, and also when we talked about, for example, the sideburns, we talked about the jaw, but also it could be part of the cheek.
所以你有下巴，上唇，还有当我们谈论例如鬓角时，我们谈论下颌，但也可以是脸颊的一部分。

240
Right.
对。

241
So every person has two cheeks, one on the left and one on the right, and those are a very big part of your face on the sides of your nose.
所以每个人都有两颊，一个在左边，一个在右边，那是你脸的一个很大部分，在鼻子的两侧。

242
Okay.
好的。

243
So you have your chin, you have your cheeks, you have your upper lip.
所以你有下巴，你有脸颊，你有上唇。

244
I think that's pretty much the only places where you can grow also on your neck.
我认为这基本上是你可以长毛发的唯一地方，还有在你的脖子上。

245
Yeah.
是的。

246
Some people have it on their neck or on the back of...
有些人脖子上或后面有。

247
Well, no, it's not...
嗯，不，这不是...

248
Some people also have it on their neck.
