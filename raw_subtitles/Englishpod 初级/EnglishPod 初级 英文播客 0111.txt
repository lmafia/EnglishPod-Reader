59
Right, so we did learn a lot about golf because they used some very specific and technical words for golf.
对，所以我们确实学到了很多关于高尔夫的知识，因为他们使用了一些非常具体和专业的高尔夫词汇。

60
So let's look at these now in language takeaway.
现在让我们在语言收获中看看这些。

61
Language takeaway.
语言收获。

62
Alright, so the announcers were talking about the game and they're talking about the course and they're here on the 8th hole and they said that last time Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one.
好吧，播报员们在谈论比赛，他们在谈论球场，他们在第8洞，他们说上次Jack Nicklaus打出了一杆进洞。

Hole in one.
一杆进洞。

64
A hole in one.

65
Okay, a hole in one.
好吧，一杆进洞。

66
So this is when you hit the ball once and the ball goes in the hole.
这是你击球一次，球就进洞。

67
Exactly, so it's something very difficult to do.
正是如此，所以这是非常难做到的事情。

68
Yes.
是的。

69
A hole in one.
一杆进洞。

70
I've certainly never made one.
我肯定从来没有做到过。

71
Okay, so sometimes it's also called an ace, so it can be a hole in one or called an ace.
好吧，有时它也被称为“王牌”，所以可以是一杆进洞或称为“王牌”。

72
Ah, okay.
啊，好的。

73
Now for our second word, now once we get to the hole, to the 9th hole or the 10th hole, we have to tee off.
现在我们的第二个词，一旦我们到达洞口，第9洞或第10洞，我们必须开球。

74
To tee off.
开球。

75
Tee off.
开球。

76
So when you tee off, you begin playing.
开球。

77
Right, so it's the very first instance where you put the little ball on the tee.
所以当你开球时，你开始打球。

78
And you hit the ball for the first time.
对，所以这是你把小球放在球座上的第一次。

79
Exactly, so to tee off.
然后你第一次击打球。

80
Now another golf vocabulary, they were talking about a caddy.
正是如此，所以开球。

81
Right, a caddy.
现在另一个高尔夫词汇，他们在谈论球童。

82
A caddy.
对，球童。

83
Now a caddy is a person.
一个球童。

84
Yes, it's the person who carries your golf clubs.
球童是一个人。

85
Exactly, so he carries your bag, your golf clubs, and basically helps you while you're playing golf.
是的，他是携带你高尔夫球杆的人。

86
Yeah, he tells you which way you should hit the ball and maybe, you know, gives you a nice cold drink and looks after you.
正是如此，所以他携带你的包、你的高尔夫球杆，并在你打高尔夫时基本上帮助你。

87
Very good.
是的，他告诉你应该如何击球，也许，给你一杯冰饮料并照顾你。

88
So that's a caddy.
非常好。

89
And now the caddy, since he has to carry all the golf clubs, Tiger Woods asked him for his driver.
所以这就是球童。

90
A driver.
现在球童，因为他必须携带所有高尔夫球杆，Tiger Woods向他要他的司机。

91
Driver.
一个司机。

92
A driver.
司机。

93
Now a driver is a type of golf club.
一个司机。

94
Right, it's not a person.
现在司机是一种高尔夫球杆。

95
No, no, it's a type of golf club and it's a very big and heavy golf club that is used to tee off.
对，这不是一个人。

96
So it's used to hit the ball a very long way.
不，不，这是一个高尔夫球杆，是一种非常大且重的高尔夫球杆，用于开球。

97
Yes, that is called the driver.
所以它用于击打球很远。

98
Okay, so the next thing they were talking about were some different types of scores that you could get on a hole.
是的，这被称为司机。

99
And the first one they mentioned was par.
好吧，他们谈论的下一个是你在一个洞上可以得到的一些不同类型的分数。

100
Okay, so you can make par.
好吧，所以你可以打平。

101
Okay, or the par of the course can be four.
好的，或者球场的标准杆可以是四杆。

102
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

103
So basically the par is the maximum number of swings or strokes you can make before putting the ball into the hole.
所以基本上，标准杆是你在将球打入洞之前可以挥杆或击球的最大次数。

104
Right, so it's like, it's like the, right, so when the, when a hole is par four, you should only hit the ball four times.
对，所以就像，当一个洞是四杆时，你应该只打四次球。

105
Four if you don't make par, there are some options.
如果你没有打平标准杆，还有一些选择。

106
You can make a bogey.
你可以打个柏忌。

107
All right, a bogey.
好吧，柏忌。

108
A bogey.
柏忌。

109
Now sometimes the golf course is very difficult.
现在有时高尔夫球场非常困难。

110
Yeah.
是的。

111
So instead of putting the ball in the hole, let's say in four turns, you do it in five.
所以如果你在四杆内没有将球打入洞，而是用了五杆。

112
Okay, so it's one over par.
好的，所以这是一个超标杆。

113
One over par.
超过标准杆一杆。

114
So that's bad.
所以这不好。

115
Yeah, that's bad because you get a point.
是的，这不好，因为你会得一分。

116
So it's kind of strange because in golf, the more points you have, the worse you are, the worse you are.
所以这有点奇怪，因为在高尔夫中，分数越多，你就越糟糕。

117
So that is a bogey.
所以这就是柏忌。

118
Now, they also talked about a birdie.
现在，他们还谈到了小鸟球。

119
Birdie is the opposite if you hit one under par.
小鸟球是相反的，如果你打得低于标准杆。

120
So that's good.
所以这很好。

121
Yeah, that's good because you have minus one, one less than par.
是的，这很好，因为你有负一，比标准杆少一。

122
All right, so this is actually a lot of weird, crazy, strange language, birdie, bogey, caddie, driver.
好吧，所以这实际上是很多奇怪、疯狂、奇特的语言，像小鸟球、柏忌、球童、发球木。

123
Why don't we listen to the dialogue one more time to help us understand?
我们再听一遍对话，帮助我们理解好吗？

124
