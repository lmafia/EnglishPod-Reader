So now why don't we take a look at four key words that we have prepared for you today on Language Takeaway.
现在我们来看看今天在语言收获中为你准备的四个关键词。

64
First up, we have a very important thing to bring to the beach, especially if you're like me and you burn easily.
首先，我们有一个非常重要的东西要带到海滩，特别是如果你像我一样容易晒伤。

65
So this thing is called sunscreen.
这个东西叫防晒霜。

66
Okay, sunscreen.
好吧，防晒霜。

67
Now this is a liquid, and you put it on your skin, right?
这是液体，你涂在皮肤上，对吗？

68
And this protects you from the sun.
这可以保护你免受阳光的伤害。

69
So basically you put this cream all over your body to prevent sunburns, to prevent burning under the sun.
所以基本上你把这种乳霜涂在全身，以防止晒伤。

70
It's very important.
这非常重要。

71
So it's called sunscreen or also sometimes called sunblock.
所以它叫防晒霜，有时也叫防晒油。

72
That's right.
没错。

73
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

74
Now we have our sunscreen and we arrive to the beach and one of the parents say, all right, we're going to set up camp.
现在我们有了防晒霜，到了海滩，其中一个家长说，好吧，我们要搭帐篷。

75
Okay, to set up camp.
好吧，搭帐篷。

76
Well, this might be confusing because as many of you know, camp, camping, this is an activity, but we're not actually camping here.
这可能会让人困惑，因为你们中的许多人知道，露营是一项活动，但我们实际上并不是在这里露营。

77
We're just going to be at the beach for one day.
我们只是要在海滩待一天。

78
So to set up camp means to organize or arrange ourselves in a place.
所以搭帐篷意味着在一个地方组织或安排自己。

79
So it's a colloquial way of saying we are going to organize the area where we're going to spend the day.
这是一种口语化的说法，表示我们要整理我们将要度过一天的区域。

80
We're going to make ourselves comfortable.
我们要让自己舒适。

81
So you set up camp.
所以你搭帐篷。

82
So not necessarily that you're going to camp there, but that you're going to prepare the area.
并不一定意味着你要在那里露营，而是要准备好这个区域。

83
So this could be used in many other different areas, right?
所以这可以在许多其他地方使用，对吧？

84
That's right.
没错。

85
So sometimes, you know, when tickets for really popular concerts go on sale, people line up for days before they can buy the tickets.
所以有时，当热门音乐会的门票开售时，人们会提前排队几天才能买到票。

86
Well, if you're in line, you maybe want to set up camp.
如果你在排队，你可能想搭帐篷。

87
That means make yourself comfortable, sit down, bring a book, open some food packages.
这意味着让自己舒适，坐下，带一本书，打开一些食物包装。

88
Right.
对。

89
Exactly.
正是如此。

90
So to set up camp.
所以搭帐篷。

91
And well, when we go to the beach, we want to sit down or lay down on the sand.
当我们去海滩时，我们想坐下或躺在沙滩上。

92
And in order to do this, we usually bring along beach towels.
为了做到这一点，我们通常会带上沙滩毛巾。

93
That's right, Marco.
没错，Marco。

94
So towels can be any kind of towel.
毛巾可以是任何种类的毛巾。

95
You have a towel in your bathroom or in your kitchen.
你在浴室或厨房里有毛巾。

96
Basically, a piece of cloth that you use to dry yourself.
基本上，是用来擦干自己的布块。

97
But the special kind of towel we bring to the beach is called, of course, a beach towel.
但我们带到海滩的特殊毛巾当然叫沙滩毛巾。

98
Right.
对。

99
These are usually much bigger than normal towels.
这些通常比普通毛巾大得多。

100
Yeah, they're very, very big.
是的，它们非常非常大。

101
And this is usually because you want to lay down on the sand on top of this towel, right?
这通常是因为你想在这块毛巾上躺在沙子上，对吧？

102
That's right.
没错。

103
Okay.
好的。

104
And the last word that we have for language takeaway is a beach umbrella or just an umbrella.
我们要学习的最后一个词是海滩伞或只是伞。

105
That's right.
没错。

106
So maybe you're lying down on this big, comfortable, soft beach towel and you're afraid of being under the sun too much.
所以也许你躺在这块大而舒适的海滩毛巾上，担心在阳光下待太久。

107
So an umbrella is a way to protect yourself from the sun.
所以伞是保护自己免受阳光的方式。

108
It provides shade.
它提供阴凉。

109
That's right.
没错。

110
So it's called an umbrella or usually if you want to distinguish between the umbrella you use for the rain, you can call it a beach umbrella.
所以它叫做伞，或者如果你想区分用于下雨的伞，可以称之为海滩伞。

111
That's right.
没错。

112
Okay.
好的。

113
And these are usually a lot bigger and you don't actually carry them around in your hand.
这些通常要大得多，你实际上不会手持它们。

114
You have to put them into the sand.
你必须把它们插入沙子里。

115
That's right.
没错。

116
So it stands alone.
所以它是独立的。

117
Okay.

Or you also play frisbee.

That's right, so a frisbee itself is usually made of plastic and it's like a plate and it's very light and you throw it to your friends and it sails through the air.

Okay.
好的。

176
And well, whenever we go to the beach, the ocean can be a little bit dangerous.
每当我们去海滩时，海洋可能会有点危险。

177
And that's why in the dialogue one of the parents told their kids to stay in the shallow area of the water.
这就是为什么对话中一个父母告诉他们的孩子要待在水的浅水区。

178
That's right.

182
It's not very deep.

183
Okay, so there's very little water.
好的，所以水很少。

But if there's a lot of water, maybe if you swim and you can't touch your feet on the ground, we call that deep.
但如果水很多，也许你游泳时无法触碰到地面，我们称之为深水。

185
So shallow is very low water and deep is lots and lots of water.
所以浅水是水很少，深水是水很多。

186
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

187
So you'll usually find this in the ocean if you go further, further, further in, it'll get deeper and deeper and deeper.
所以如果你在海洋中往更深的地方走，它会越来越深。

188
And more and more dangerous.
而且越来越危险。

189

And this is why the mom also told the kid to not pass that sand bar that was ahead.

Okay, sand bar.

192
This is a piece of sand that basically rises very high in the water.

193
So usually when you're on the beach and you go into the water and it gets deeper and deeper and then all of a sudden it gets high again and there's more sand.
所以通常当你在海滩上，走进水中，水越来越深，然后突然又高起来，有更多的沙子。

194
Right.
对。

195
And so that part that you can stand on, that sand out in the water, that's called a sand bar.
所以你可以站在的那部分，水中的沙子，叫做沙洲。

196
It's almost like a little island.
它几乎就像一个小岛。

197
Yeah, exactly.
是的，没错。

198
And as you said, usually it gets deeper, deeper, then you have the sand bar so it gets higher.
正如你所说，通常水会越来越深，然后你有沙洲，所以它又高了。

199
But usually if you pass the sand bar, it's going to get really deep all of a sudden.
但通常如果你越过沙洲，水会突然变得很深。

200
That's right.
没错。

201
So that's why the mother doesn't want her child to go past the sand bar.
所以这就是为什么母亲不想让她的孩子越过沙洲。

202
Right.
对。

203
And well, if you're ever swimming in a swimming pool in the ocean, it's always a good idea if you don't know how to swim well or if you have children to take along little floaties.
如果你在海洋的游泳池里游泳，如果你不会游泳或者带着孩子，带上小浮圈总是个好主意。

204
Okay, floaties.

A floaties are plastic rings that you put around your arms or maybe around your stomach and they're filled with air.

对。

208
So when you go in the water, they help you float.
所以当你进水时，它们帮助你漂浮。

209
Exactly.
正是如此。

210
So this is a very common thing to put on children because they don't know how to swim well.
所以这是给孩子们穿的非常常见的东西，因为他们不会游泳。

211
You put them little floaties on their arms or around their stomachs and then they can just float and they won't drown.
你把小浮圈放在他们的手臂或肚子上，然后他们可以漂浮，不会淹死。

212
That's right.
没错。

213
Floaties.
浮圈。

214
Very good.
非常好。

215
So a lot of key words there are related to the fun of going to the beach.
所以有很多关键词与去海滩的乐趣有关。

216
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue for the very last time.
我们为什么不回去再听最后一次对话呢。
