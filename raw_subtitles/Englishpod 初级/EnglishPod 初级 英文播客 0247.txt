And today, we're going to continue in our series about job interviews.
今天，我们将继续我们的求职面试系列。

5
That's right.
没错。

6
And on this occasion, we're taking a look at part five of our interview series where we explain why we left our previous job.
这次，我们将讨论面试系列的第五部分，解释我们为什么离开了之前的工作。

7
Okay, and so in an interview, this is a very popular question.
好的，在面试中，这是一个非常常见的问题。

8
Why did you leave your last job?

9
Learn some tools for answering this question in today's dialogue.
在今天的对话中学习一些回答这个问题的工具。

10
We're going to take a listen to it first, and we'll be back in a moment.
我们先来听一下，然后稍后再回来。

11
Okay, now I'd like to find out more about your last job.
好的，现在我想了解一下你上一份工作的情况。

12
I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly.
我看到你在伦敦周刊工作了将近四年。

13
Is that right?
是吗？

14
Yes, that's right.
是的，没错。

15
To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me.
说实话，第一年对我来说相当艰难。

16
I was really just treated more like an intern.
我真的只是被当作实习生对待。

17
I didn't have many responsibilities, and I found it quite frustrating.
我没有太多责任，这让我感到相当沮丧。

18
So what changed?
那么，是什么改变了呢？

19
Well, slowly but surely, I proved myself, and the new editor liked me, so he promoted me to features writer.
嗯，慢慢地，我证明了自己，新编辑喜欢我，所以他把我提升为特写作家。

20
Wow, a real step up.
哇，真是一个飞跃。

21
Yes, I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly.
是的，我主要负责餐厅和食品评论。

22
I spent three years in that position.
我在那个职位上待了三年。

23
But to be honest, it wasn't an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long term.
但说实话，这不是我想长期从事的新闻领域。

24
I see.
我明白了。

25
So why did you decide to leave finally?
那你为什么最终决定离开？

26
I just felt that the paper couldn't offer me any new opportunities.
我只是觉得报纸无法给我提供新的机会。

27
I really needed a more challenging role, to be honest.
说实话，我真的需要一个更具挑战性的角色。

28
Alright, we're back, and as we saw, Rebecca handled it quite well, explaining why you left your last job.
好的，我们回来了，正如我们所看到的，Rebecca处理得很好，解释了你为什么离开了上一份工作。

29
Because obviously, you don't want to say something like, Well, I just really didn't like my company.
因为显然，你不想说类似“我真的不喜欢我的公司”这样的话。

30
Or, you know, the boss was a really bad guy.
或者，“你知道，老板是个坏人。”

31
Or I was fired for being lazy.
或者“我因为懒惰被解雇了。”

32
Exactly.
正是如此。

33
So why don't we take a look at a couple of different words on language takeaway.
那么我们为什么不看看一些不同的语言要点呢。

34
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

35
Okay, so we've got some great descriptive words here.
好的，这里有一些很好的描述性词汇。

36
These are some adjectives.
这些是一些形容词。

37
The first one is tough.
第一个是艰难。

38
So Rebecca said, To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me.
所以Rebecca说：“说实话，第一年对我来说相当艰难。”

39
Alright, so she's describing that her first year at that company where she was working, it was tough.
好的，所以她在描述她在那家公司工作的第一年是艰难的。

40
And that means hard, difficult.
这意味着困难，艰难。

41
That's right.
没错。

42
So you could say, This is a really tough situation.
所以你可以说：“这是一个非常艰难的情况。”

43
That means it's a difficult situation.
这意味着这是一个困难的情况。

44
It's hard because there's no easy answer.
因为没有简单的答案。

45
Exactly.
正是如此。

46
So if you describe something as tough, it means that it's very difficult.
所以如果你形容某事为艰难，意味着它非常困难。

47
Now there is another meaning to this where it can be that you are a strong person.
现在还有另一种含义，就是你是一个坚强的人。

48
Right.
对。

49
So that's different because we're talking about a person, not a situation.
这不同，因为我们在谈论一个人，而不是一个情况。

50
But if you're talking about a job or an experience or even homework, like this homework is really tough, it means that it's very hard.
但如果你在谈论一份工作或经历，甚至是作业，比如“这份作业真的很艰难”，这意味着它非常困难。

51
Exactly.
正是如此。

52
Well, apart from her job of being a little bit tough, she said that it was also a little bit frustrating.
除了她的工作有点艰难，她还说这也有点沮丧。

53
Okay, so usually these things go together.
好的，通常这些事情是一起发生的。

54
If something is tough, like it's difficult, it's usually frustrating too.
如果某事是艰难的，比如它是困难的，通常也会让人感到沮丧。

55
And so in this case, something is frustrating when it makes you unhappy or, for example, it makes you feel stressed.
所以在这种情况下，某事让你感到沮丧时，它会让你不快乐，或者，比如说，它让你感到压力。

56
So something that's frustrating is not a good thing.
所以让人沮丧的事情不是好事。

57
Exactly.
正是如此。

58
So as you gave the example with the homework assignment, if you have maybe a math assignment that's very difficult and you can't solve it, you don't find the solution, then you get frustrated.
所以就像你给出的作业例子，如果你有一个非常困难的数学作业，而你无法解决它，你找不到解决方案，那么你就会感到沮丧。

59
You get maybe angry at yourself or you get very angry for not being able to solve it.
你可能会对自己感到生气，或者因为无法解决而非常生气。

60
So that's when something is frustrating.
所以这就是让人沮丧的情况。

61
I hate being frustrated.
我讨厌感到沮丧。

62
Exactly.
正是如此。

63
Well, it's not a nice feeling.
嗯，这不是一种愉快的感觉。

64
But she said that, well, it was frustrating, it was tough, but, you know, after a while, I proved myself.
但她说，虽然这很沮丧，很艰难，但你知道，过了一段时间，我证明了自己。

65
Okay, so that means that she was able to show someone that she can handle difficult things, difficult work, difficult situations.
好的，这意味着她能够向某人展示她能够处理困难的事情、艰难的工作、艰难的情况。

66
And so she said, I proved myself and the new editor liked me.
所以她说：“我证明了自己，新编辑喜欢我。”

67
So basically, she did a really good job.
所以基本上，她做得很好。

68
Exactly.
正是如此。

69
So if you prove yourself, you're showing someone that you have great ability or capabilities of solving a problem or being able to handle a difficult job.
所以如果你证明了自己，你就是在向某人展示你有很强的能力或解决问题的能力，或者能够处理一份困难的工作。

70
That's right.
没错。

71
For example, I could say, you know, last year, Bob didn't do very well at school, but this year, he really proved himself.
例如，我可以说，你知道，去年Bob在学校表现不太好，但今年他真的证明了自己。

72
He studied hard and he got really good grades.
他努力学习，得到了很好的成绩。

73
Exactly.
正是如此。

74
And well, Rebecca, what she got in exchange for proving herself, she got promoted.
而Rebecca，她因证明自己而获得了晋升。

75
This is great.
这太好了。

76
So promotions are good things.
所以晋升是好事。

77
The verb here is to promote or to be promoted.
这里的动词是晋升或被晋升。

78
So in this case, she was promoted.
所以在这种情况下，她被晋升了。

79
You could say, last year, I was promoted, or he will be promoted next week.
你可以说，去年我被晋升，或者他下周将被晋升。

80
He doesn't know yet.
他还不知道。

81
Exactly.
正是如此。

82
Now, remember that to be promoted means to get a better position in your job.
现在，记住被晋升意味着在你的工作中获得更好的职位。

83
Now, as we mentioned, the verb is to promote.
现在，正如我们提到的，动词是晋升。

84
And you may be asking yourself why we are using the verb to be in the past was promoted.
你可能会问自己，为什么我们使用过去式的动词“被晋升”。

85
And this is because it's an ed adjective.
这是因为它是一个-ed形容词。

86
It's an adjective that ends in ed.
它是一个以-ed结尾的形容词。

87
So you may think it's a verb, but it's not.
所以你可能会认为它是一个动词，但其实不是。

88
It's actually an adjective.
它实际上是一个形容词。

89
The verb here is to be.
这里的动词是“是”。

90
Exactly.
正是如此。

91
So I was promoted was is obviously our verb here, the verb to be, but promoted is an adjective that ends in ed.
所以“我被晋升”中的“被”显然是我们的动词，这个动词是“是”，但“晋升”是一个以-ed结尾的形容词。

92
Okay.
好的。

93
And so if I'm the boss, the action I do, the verb I do is I promote someone.
所以如果我是老板，我所做的动作，动词是我晋升某人。

94
So this can be a little bit tricky.
所以这可能有点棘手。

95
But we recommend that you check out the website for more details, because we have lots of examples of how to use this.
但我们建议你查看网站以获取更多细节，因为我们有很多使用示例。

96
Exactly.
正是如此。

97
Well, she got promoted.
嗯，她被晋升了。

98
And well, she was really happy for a while.
而且，她真的很高兴了一段时间。

99
But then she said, you know what, I really needed a more challenging role, a more challenging job.
但后来她说，你知道，我真的需要一个更具挑战性的角色，一个更具挑战性的工作。

100
Okay, challenging is a great adjective, it means something is difficult, or it gives you a challenge.
好的，挑战性是一个很好的形容词，它意味着某事是困难的，或者给你带来了挑战。

101
So that means it's not easy.
所以这意味着这并不容易。

102
Yeah.
是的。

103
So she found that her job was a little bit too easy.
所以她发现她的工作有点太简单了。

104
So she wanted something a little bit more challenging.
所以她想要一些更具挑战性的东西。

105
Okay.
好的。

106
And so this is a really great word for job interviews in particular, because you're basically saying, I want hard work, I want to prove myself, there we go again prove, I want to show you that I'm a good employee or a hard worker.
所以这在求职面试中是个很好的词，因为你基本上是在说，我想要努力工作，我想证明自己，我们再次提到证明，我想向你展示我是一个好员工或勤奋的工作者。

107
And so I want a challenge, something that's hard.
所以我想要一个挑战，某些困难的东西。

108
Exactly.
正是如此。

109
So something that is hard is a challenge, or you want something challenging.
所以某些困难的东西就是一个挑战，或者你想要一些具有挑战性的东西。

110
So why don't we review these words that we've taken a look at now.
那么我们为什么不复习一下我们现在看到的这些词呢。

111
Let's go back to the dialogue and listen to it again.
让我们回到对话中，再听一遍。

132

133
So now let's take a look at a couple of phrases we picked out for you on Fluency Builder.
现在让我们看看我们为你挑选的几个短语，来自流利构建器。

134
Fluency Builder.
流利构建器。

135
Okay, this first phrase is unusual, because it actually happens at the end of sentences.
好的，第一个短语很不寻常，因为它实际上出现在句子的末尾。

136
This is very, very common with people who are making small talk or who are doing interviews.
这在进行闲聊或面试时非常常见。

137
This is the phrase.
这是这个短语。

138
Is that right?
是吗？

139
Mm hmm.
嗯嗯。

140
So basically, you saw that in the first line, Mr. Parsons was talking to her and said, Well, I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly.
所以基本上，你在第一行看到，帕森斯先生在和她说，嗯，我看到你在伦敦周刊工作了将近四年。

141
Is that right?
是吗？

142
So he's ending the sentence with this phrase.
所以他用这个短语结束了句子。

143
So he's making the sentence a question.
所以他把句子变成了一个问题。

144
I see that you did this.

146
So he's asking her to confirm the fact that he knows about her, because maybe they've never really talked before.

147
So this is a good way for him to ask her to give more details.

正是如此。

149
So for example, Marco, I hear that you're from Ecuador.
例如，马尔科，我听说你来自厄瓜多尔。

150
Is that right?
是吗？

151
That's right.
没错。

152

158

159
Yeah, I think it wouldn't be very good if you're at a job interview and the person says, Is that right?
是的，我觉得如果你在面试中，对方说，是吗？

160
And you say, Yes, that's right.
而你说，是的，没错。

161
And then you don't say anything else.
然后你什么也不说，那就不好了。

162
So yeah, the base, the basically the point is you have to confirm or deny it to say, Yes, that's right.
所以，是的，基本上要点是你必须确认或否认，说明，是的，没错。

163
Or no, that's not right.

167
Now, moving on when Rebecca again was talking about her job, she was saying it's tough.
现在，继续，当丽贝卡再次谈论她的工作时，她说这很艰难。

168
And I didn't have many responsibilities.
而且我没有太多责任。

169
And I found it quite frustrating.
我觉得这相当沮丧。

170
Okay, so this is like lost and found like I lost my hat and I found it later.
好的，这就像失物招领，我丢了我的帽子，后来找到了。

171
No, no, this is what's interesting about this verb.
不，不，这个动词有趣的地方在于。

172
Find we are not actually looking for something, or we didn't actually find something we were looking for.
find我们实际上并不是在寻找某样东西，或者我们并没有找到我们在寻找的东西。

173
This is kind of a realization, right?
这是一种领悟，对吧？

174
That's right.
没错。

175
It's like a feeling.
这就像一种感觉。

176
So I find this movie boring.
所以我觉得这部电影很无聊。

177
That means I think this movie is boring.
这意味着我认为这部电影很无聊。

178
It's the way that you're thinking about something.
这是你对某事的看法。

179
That's right.
没错。

180
Or you can say, Oh, I found Paris to be quite an expensive city.
或者你可以说，哦，我觉得巴黎是个相当昂贵的城市。

181
Yeah, pretty expensive.
是的，挺贵的。

182
So this, this is your impression.
所以这是你的印象。

183
This is the way that you feel about something.
这是你对某事的感觉。

184
Exactly.
正是如此。

185
So this is another way that you can use this word to find.
所以这是你可以使用这个词find的另一种方式。

186
Now, again, when Rebecca talked about proving herself, she used a very interesting, I would say phrase, a very popular, well known phrase, slowly but surely.
现在，再次，当丽贝卡谈到证明自己时，她使用了一个非常有趣，我会说的短语，一个非常流行、众所周知的短语，慢慢来但一定会成功。

187
Okay, so slowly but surely is the opposite of right away.
好的，所以慢慢来但一定会成功是立即的反义词。

188
Right?
对吧？

189
So something that happens right away is, is immediate, like I got promoted right away.
所以某事立即发生是即时的，比如我立即被晋升。

190
But slowly but surely means after lots of time, and even hard work, this good thing happened, or it's usually a good thing, actually.
但慢慢来但一定会成功意味着经过很长时间，甚至是艰苦的工作，这件好事发生了，或者通常是好事，实际上。

191
Yeah, yeah, it's a, you're basically saying that you didn't do anything very quickly, but you did it very well.
是的，是的，你基本上是在说你没有做任何事情很快，但你做得很好。

192
So slowly, but surely, I finished building my home.
所以慢慢来，但一定会成功，我完成了我的房子建设。

193
Right.
对。

194
So it didn't happen overnight.
所以这不是一夜之间发生的。

195
But it did happen over time.
但它确实是随着时间的推移发生的。

196
You can also say this about studying a language.
你也可以这样说学习一门语言。

197
You know, at the beginning, learning English was really hard, but slowly, but surely I became fluent.
你知道，一开始，学习英语真的很难，但慢慢来，但肯定我变得流利了。

198
Exactly.
正是如此。

199
Okay, so slowly, but surely.
好吧，所以慢慢来，但肯定。

200
And the last phrase that we have for you today, you may have seen that Rebecca used this phrase to be honest a couple of times before explaining something.
今天我们为你准备的最后一句话，你可能看到Rebecca在解释某些事情之前用过这个短语“老实说”几次。

201
So why does she say to be honest?
那么她为什么要说“老实说”？

202
To be honest is sometimes something we say in English to fill some space or some time.
“老实说”有时是我们在英语中用来填补一些空白或时间的说法。

203
We call it filler.
我们称之为填充词。

204
But it's also a way to introduce something that's negative.
但这也是引入一些负面内容的一种方式。

205
So for example, in this dialogue, she's talking about her negative experiences.
例如，在这个对话中，她谈论她的负面经历。

206
You know, my job was tough, my experience was bad.
你知道，我的工作很艰难，我的经历很糟糕。

207
So she says, to be honest, it wasn't the best experience, but I learned from it.
所以她说，老实说，这不是最好的经历，但我从中学到了东西。

208
She's saying this to introduce some things that are maybe not positive, not happy things.
她这样说是为了引入一些可能不是积极的、不快乐的事情。

209
That's right.
没错。

210
So it's another way of saying, look, I'm going to tell you the truth.
所以这是一种说法，看看，我要告诉你真相。

211
It may not be something positive, but you know, this is what happened.
这可能不是积极的事情，但你知道，这就是发生的事情。

212
So to be honest, I didn't really like my last employer or something like that.
所以老实说，我并不太喜欢我上一个雇主或类似的事情。

213
You can even talk about this with your friends.
你甚至可以和你的朋友谈论这个。

214
So hey, Marco, did you like that movie Shutter Island?
所以嘿，Marco，你喜欢那部电影《禁闭岛》吗？

215
To be honest, I didn't really see it.
老实说，我并没有真正看过。

216
Oh, I fell asleep.
哦，我睡着了。

217
Or you could say to be honest, I didn't love it.
或者你可以说老实说，我并不喜欢它。

218
I didn't really like it.
我并不太喜欢它。

219
Exactly.
正是如此。

220
So it's a very, it's a very good phrase, but don't overuse it.
所以这是一个非常好的短语，但不要过度使用。

221
I think sometimes you get into the habit of using it all the time.
我觉得有时你会习惯性地一直使用它。

222
And just like, like, you know, well, you know, like, I went to the movies like yesterday, like, and like, to be honest, like, so try to keep these fillers as you describe them to a minimum.
就像，你知道的，嗯，你知道，像，我昨天去看电影，像，老实说，像，所以尽量把这些填充词保持在最低限度。

223
So don't really use them too much.
所以不要真的用得太多。

224
Yes.
是的。

225
Say thoughts and ideas, nice action verbs, not too much fillers, because sometimes, especially in an interview, it makes people think that you don't really know much to say.
说出思想和想法，好的动作动词，不要太多填充词，因为有时，尤其是在面试中，这会让人觉得你真的没有太多要说的。

226
Yeah, exactly.
是的，正是如此。

227
Okay.
好的。

228
So let's listen to the dialogue for the last time.
所以让我们最后一次听这个对话。

229
And we'll be back to chat a little bit more.

我明白了。

246
So why did you decide to leave finally?
那么你最后为什么决定离开？

247
I just felt that the paper couldn't offer me any new opportunities.
我只是觉得报纸无法给我提供任何新的机会。

248
I really needed a more challenging role, to be honest.

253
Don't say my boss was mean, my co workers were lazy, my company was terrible, because usually as a as a person doing an interview, that makes you think that this person, if they work for you will complain about you.
不要说我的老板很刻薄，我的同事很懒，我的公司很糟糕，因为通常作为面试官，这会让你觉得这个人如果为你工作会抱怨你。

I think this is important for anybody in any language, but in English, especially to use some of these phrases and to say, you know, I really like a challenge or I didn't feel this was challenging enough, things like this, as opposed to my old boss is so mean, he made me work on the weekends.
我认为这对任何人来说都很重要，在任何语言中，尤其是在英语中，使用一些这样的短语，并说，你知道，我真的喜欢挑战，或者我觉得这不够具有挑战性，类似的事情，而不是说我以前的老板太刻薄了，他让我在周末工作。

No one wants to hear.

And I think it's not really useful because even if the company is a competitor, so you're really getting the extra points for, for giving them like the dirty secrets of what was going on in the company, maybe saying, Oh, my coworkers, they were just so mean to me and stuff like this.
我认为这并不真的有用，因为即使公司是竞争对手，所以你真的得到了额外的分数，给他们像公司内部的肮脏秘密，可能会说，哦，我的同事，他们对我太刻薄了，类似的事情。

265
Yeah, no, it makes you seem like a complainer and no one wants to hire a complainer.
是的，不，这让你看起来像个抱怨者，没有人想雇佣一个抱怨者。
