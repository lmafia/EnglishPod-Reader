And today we have a great elementary level lesson all about having fun.
今天我们有一节关于乐趣的初级课程。

5
That's right.
没错。

6
Today we are going to have a lot of fun.
今天我们会玩得很开心。

7
And, well, before we explain what exactly we're going to do, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview?
在我们解释具体要做什么之前，先来看看词汇预览吧？

8
Vocabulary preview.
词汇预览。

9
Okay, so the word we're previewing today is a noun.
好的，今天我们预览的单词是一个名词。

10
It's a thing.
它是一个东西。

11
It's a roller coaster.
它是过山车。

12
All right, a roller coaster.
好的，过山车。

13
So that's what we're going to do today.
所以今天我们要做的就是这个。

14
We're going to get on a roller coaster.
我们要坐过山车。

15
But what is a roller coaster?
但过山车是什么呢？

16
Well, a roller coaster is something that we see oftentimes in parks, amusement parks.
过山车是我们在公园、游乐园常见的东西。

17
And it's like a little train, but it can go upside down, and it goes very fast, and it turns, and it's supposed to make you scared and happy.
它像一列小火车，但可以翻转，速度很快，还会转弯，应该让你感到害怕和快乐。

18
Okay, so it goes very fast, and yet many people have probably seen it.
好的，它的速度很快，很多人可能都见过。

19
It goes very fast, and as you say, up and down.
它速度很快，正如你所说，上下起伏。

20
And, well, you just get on it because it's fun.
而且，你就是因为好玩才去坐它。

21
You go fast and you get scared because you're going so fast and sometimes you're going upside down.
你会很快，感到害怕，因为你速度太快，有时还会翻转。

22
Exactly, and for some reason, I don't know why, but in many romance languages the name is Russian mountains.
没错，不知道为什么，在很多罗曼语中，它被称为俄罗斯山。

23
Exactly, yeah, it's also, in Spanish it's also a Russian mountain.
没错，在西班牙语中也是俄罗斯山。

24
So I think the reason is because back in the day, back, you know, a hundred years ago when they were starting, the first roller coasters came from Russia.
我想原因是因为在一百年前，最早的过山车来自俄罗斯。

25
Oh wow, so that's why it's called... Well, that's a theory, I'm not sure, but take a listen to today's dialogue.
哇，所以这就是为什么它叫……这只是一个理论，我不确定，但听听今天的对话吧。

26
We'll hear it one time, and when we come back, we'll be talking about more interesting and exciting phrases and words about roller coasters.

31
All right, settle down now.

32
You're gonna give yourself a heart attack.
你会让自己心脏病发作的。

33
I can't believe they charge us $35 each.
我真不敢相信他们每人收我们35美元。

34
Seems like such a ripoff, don't you think?
这看起来真是个骗局，你不觉得吗？

35
It's not like I'm gonna get on these things.
我又不是要坐这些东西。

36
Whoa!
哇！

37

38
That's the world's highest and fastest roller coaster!

41

42
Can I?
我可以吗？

43
Chris, I'm not sure you should get on that.
Chris，我不确定你应该去坐那个。

44
It seems a bit too much for you, and we've just had breakfast 30 minutes ago.
对你来说似乎有点太多了，而且我们刚吃完早餐30分钟。

45
I don't think it's a good idea.

46
Come on, Mom, I can handle it.

47
I promise I won't ask for anything else.

50
He'll be fine.

54
Whoa!
哇！

55
All.
好的，我们回来了。

56
right, we're back.
很有趣。

57
So, interesting.
我觉得这很常见。

58
I think this is very common.
你坐上这些东西，速度太快，结果就呕吐了。

59
You get on one of these things, you go so fast that you just throw up.
你有没有呕吐过？

60
Have you ever thrown up?
在过山车上？

61
On a roller coaster?
没有，从来没有。

62
No, never.
好吧，可能这并不常见，但我们来看看在这段对话中，男孩和他的父母之间听到的一些单词。

63
All right, well, maybe it's not that common, but let's take a look at some of the words that we hear in this conversation between a boy and his parents.
好的，正如我们提到的这个词，呕吐，呕吐。

64
All right, so as we mentioned this word, throw up, to throw up.
我们先看看这个吧？

65
Why don't we take a look at that one first?
虽然它几乎在对话的结尾，但呕吐是什么？

66
Although it's almost at the end of the dialogue, what is it, to throw up?
好吧，呕吐和呕吐是不同的。

67
Okay, well, to throw is different than to throw up.
所以记住这两个词是一起的，意思是呕吐。

68
So remember that these two words go together to mean to vomit.
这意味着你胃里的东西从嘴里出来。

69
That means that the things in your stomach come out your mouth.
就像我们在对话中听到的那样，听起来很恶心，对吧？

70
So like we heard in the dialogue, they came in like... Yeah, it's a very disgusting sound, right?
所以有时人们吃得太多会呕吐，有时生病时会呕吐，有时坐过山车后会呕吐。

71
And so sometimes people throw up when they eat too much, sometimes they throw up when they're sick, and sometimes they throw up after riding a roller coaster.
所以这是一个重要的短语。

72
And so this is an important phrase to know.
或者像你在船上时，晕船呕吐。

73
Or like when you're on a boat, you get seasick and you throw up.
或者在车里，有时你会晕车。

74
Or in a car, sometimes you get carsick.
好的，正如我们提到的，我们也在游乐园。

75
All right, so as we mentioned, we're also visiting an amusement park.
那我们来解释一下这个词吧？

76
So why don't we explain this word a little bit?
游乐园。

77
Amusement park.
好的，首先，每个人可能都知道公园这个词，它是一个公共场所。

78
Okay, first of all, everyone probably knows the word park, you know, it's a public place.
但在这种情况下，游乐园是一个充满乐趣的公园。

79
But in this case, an amusement park is a park of fun.
游乐意味着乐趣。

80
Amusement means fun.
所以通常是你去的地方，你支付一个价格，他们给你一张票，你可以玩一整天。

81
And so it's usually a place that you go to and you pay a price, and they give you a ticket, and you can play all day long.
所以他们有过山车、食物和表演。

82
So they have roller coasters and food and shows.
所以最著名或最知名的游乐园可能是迪士尼乐园。

83
So probably the most famous or well known amusement park is Disneyland.
所以这就是游乐园。

84
So that's an amusement park.
没错。

85
Exactly.
这里有很多适合各个年龄段的有趣活动。

86
And there's lots of fun things to do for people of all ages.
好的。

87
All right.
现在孩子太兴奋了，妈妈说，好的，你会让自己心脏病发作的。

88
And now the kid was so excited that the mom said, All right, you're gonna give yourself a heart attack.
好吧，心脏病发作是我们之前谈到的另一个严重健康问题，呕吐是当你的心脏停止跳动，对吧？

89
Okay, well, a heart attack is another serious health issue we talked about throwing up before is when your heart stops beating, right?

90
Okay, right.
好的，没错。

91
So maybe something is stuck, or there's there's some problem with your your your heart, and there's no more blood going through your heart.
所以可能有什么东西卡住了，或者你的心脏有问题，血液无法流通。

92
And so it's a very, very serious issue.
所以这是一个非常非常严重的问题。

93
But in this case, she's saying you're so excited, you might hurt your heart, you're gonna have a heart attack, you might hurt yourself because you're so excited, right?
但在这种情况下，她说你太兴奋了，可能会伤到你的心脏，你会心脏病发作，可能会因为太兴奋而受伤，对吧？

94
So she's exaggerating.
所以她在夸大其词。

95
That's not really going to happen.
这并不会真的发生。

96
But she's trying to warn him.
但她是在试图警告他。

97
All right.
好的。

98
And now the father mentioned that they paid $35 for each of their tickets, and he thought it was a rip off.
现在父亲提到他们为每张票支付了35美元，他认为这是个骗局。

99
Okay, rip off is a great, great phrase that we use in spoken English to describe something that's unfair.
好吧，骗局是我们在口语中用来描述不公平的东西的一个很好的短语。

100
So a price that's unfair.
所以一个不公平的价格。

101
Okay, so you can maybe go to the market, right?
好吧，你可以去市场，对吧？

102
And you ask how much a sweater is, and they'll tell you it's $100.
你问一件毛衣多少钱，他们会告诉你是100美元。

103
You think that's a rip off?
你觉得这太贵了吗？

104
What a rip off.
真是太贵了。

105
I can buy a sweater for $20.
我可以花20美元买一件毛衣。

106
So 100 is definitely a rip off.
所以100绝对是太贵了。

107
All right, so that's a rip off.
好吧，那就是太贵了。

108
It was a rip off.
这确实是太贵了。

109
He's not very happy with how much money he paid.
他对自己花了多少钱不太满意。

110
Not at all.
一点也不。

111
All right.
好吧。

112
And now the kid was talking about the roller coaster that is the highest and fastest roller coaster.
现在孩子在谈论世界上最高和最快的过山车。

113
And he said that the speed was at more than 100 miles per hour.
他说速度超过每小时100英里。

114
So what about this miles per hour?
那么每小时的英里数呢？

115
Okay, this is very important if you go to America, you'll see that the speeds on the road are all in miles per hour.
好的，这在你去美国时非常重要，你会看到路上的速度都是以每小时英里为单位。

116
So mile is a distance.
所以英里是一个距离。

117
And per hour means how many miles you can travel every hour.
每小时意味着你每小时可以行驶多少英里。

118
So in one hour, you can go 100 miles.
所以在一个小时内，你可以走100英里。

119
So we have the equivalent, right?
所以我们有等价的单位，对吧？

120
We have like kilometers per hour.
我们有公里每小时。

121
Exactly.
正是如此。

122
And so miles per hour, kilometers per hour, these are both called speeds.
所以每小时的英里数和每小时的公里数，这两者都称为速度。

123
Okay.
好的。

124
And well, this is called the imperial system, right?
而且，这被称为英制系统，对吧？

125
You use miles, you use inches and feet, whereas the kilometers or centimeters or meters, you would use the metric system, right?
你使用英里，使用英寸和英尺，而公里或厘米或米，你会使用公制系统，对吧？

126
Exactly, because the counting is done by meters, meters metric.
正是如此，因为计量是以米为单位，米是公制的。

127
So in this case, we're in America, we know that because the speed limit is 100 miles or the speed here is 100 miles an hour.
所以在这种情况下，我们在美国，我们知道因为限速是100英里，或者这里的速度是每小时100英里。

128
All right.
好吧。

129
Miles.
英里。

130
We know that we're in America because the speed the boys talking about is miles per hour.
我们知道我们在美国，因为男孩谈论的速度是每小时英里数。

131
Very good.
非常好。

132
And I think yeah, use it in North America.
我想是的，在北美使用。

133
And that's pretty much it, right?
