Brunch.
早午餐。

Well, there's two ways to look at brunch.
嗯，有两种看待早午餐的方式。

47
One is the time element.

48
Usually brunch is later than breakfast.
通常早午餐比早餐晚。

49
But maybe a little earlier than lunch.

50
So 11 o'clock or maybe even noon.

51
But the other thing is size.

Because you're putting two meals together, usually brunch is very big.

53
You eat a lot of food.

54
Okay, so it's a perfect combination of breakfast and lunch.

55
I'm the type of person that likes having scrambled eggs at noon.
我是那种喜欢在中午吃炒蛋的人。

56
So this is a perfect solution.

60
Exactly.
没错。

61
This is actually something we do a lot in America for Mother's Day.

63
It's a very big special meal.
这是非常丰盛的特别餐。

64
Very good.

65
And talking about eggs and the types of eggs that we can have.
说到蛋和我们可以吃的蛋的种类。

66
I mentioned scrambled eggs.
我提到了炒蛋。

67
And in the dialogue we also heard soft-boiled eggs.
在对话中我们还听到了水煮蛋。

68
Okay, these are two very important kinds of eggs.
好的，这两种蛋非常重要。

69
Usually if you're in a restaurant they will ask you how do you want your eggs cooked or done.
通常如果你在餐厅，他们会问你想要什么样的蛋。

70
And my answer is always scrambled.
我的回答总是炒蛋。

71
Scrambled.
炒蛋。

72
This means someone mixes the eggs before they are cooked and then when they cook they are hard.
这意味着有人在煮之前把蛋打散，然后煮的时候变得硬。

73
They're yellow.
它们是黄色的。

74
Okay.
好的。

75
There's no white.
没有蛋白。

76
It's just yellow and it's it's a little hard mixture.
只有黄色，混合得有点硬。

77
But soft-boiled eggs are very very different.
但水煮蛋是非常不同的。

78
That's right.
没错。

79
Soft-boiled eggs you actually don't break the egg or open the egg to cook it like in scrambled eggs.
水煮蛋实际上是你不打破或打开蛋来煮的，就像炒蛋那样。

80
You actually put the entire egg in boiling water.
你实际上是把整个蛋放入沸水中。

81
I think it's for two minutes and then you take it out and then you open the shell and the eggs are kind of cooked.
我想是两分钟，然后你把它拿出来，打开蛋壳，蛋就煮好了。

82
It's kind of hard in some parts but it's also kind of liquidy in other parts.
有些部分是硬的，但其他部分是液态的。

83
That's right.
没错。

84
So the outside the white part is hard but the yellow part the yolk is liquid.
所以外面的蛋白是硬的，但蛋黄是液态的。

85
It's not hard.
它不是硬的。

86
That's right.
没错。

87
And actually if you want the whole egg to be hard you can ask for hard-boiled eggs.
实际上如果你想要整个蛋都是硬的，你可以要求水煮蛋。

88
That's right.
没错。

89
Those are cooked for much longer.
那些煮的时间更长。

90
That's right.
没错。

91
Okay.
好的。

92
So we have scrambled eggs, soft-boiled eggs, we have French toast, and we have buttermilk pancakes.
所以我们有炒蛋、水煮蛋、法式吐司和酪乳煎饼。

93
Okay.
好的。

94
So you can ask for just pancakes.
所以你可以只要煎饼。

95
But if you want to be specific, you want to give instructions about what kind of pancakes, you can ask for buttermilk pancakes.
但如果你想具体一点，想说明你要什么样的煎饼，你可以要求酪乳煎饼。

96
And what exactly is buttermilk?
那么酪乳到底是什么？

97
Buttermilk is a very, very creamy eggy milk that's very, very high in fat that makes everything taste better, I think.
酪乳是一种非常浓稠、非常高脂肪的奶，我认为它能让一切味道更好。

98
This is used a lot in baking, not really in other kinds of foods.
这在烘焙中使用得很多，而不是其他类型的食物。

99
So you can have buttermilk muffins or buttermilk biscuits, but usually you have buttermilk pancakes.
所以你可以有酪乳松饼或酪乳饼干，但通常你会有酪乳煎饼。

100
And so these are very rich, very fatty pancakes.
所以这些是非常丰富、非常油腻的煎饼。

101
Awesome.
太棒了。

102
Yeah, they taste delicious.
是的，味道很好。

103
Alright, so now if we want to eat a little bit more healthy, we do have some cereal and some muesli.
好吧，如果我们想吃得更健康一点，我们有一些谷物和一些麦片。

104
Muesli is a funny word.
麦片是个有趣的词。

105
It's not a sound we make very often in English.
这是我们在英语中不常发出的声音。

106
Muesli.
麦片。

107
Yeah.
是的。

108
I think it actually comes from German.
我认为它实际上来自德语。

109
It does look German, because actually the spelling is M-U-E.
它看起来确实像德语，因为拼写是 M-U-E。

110
So you would kind of want to say muesli, muesli or something.
所以你可能会想说麦片，麦片之类的。

111
Yeah, no, we say muesli, and it's basically a mixture of granola or different kinds of fiber grains.
是的，不，我们说麦片，基本上是各种谷物纤维的混合物。

112
Yeah, so just think of having like raisins and maybe some almonds, granola, all mixed up and you have this nice thing that goes well with yogurt, muesli.
是的，所以想象一下有葡萄干和一些杏仁、格兰诺拉麦片，混合在一起，你就有了这种与酸奶搭配得很好的美味麦片。

113
It's very, very tasty and also very good for you.
它非常美味，也对你很好。

114
Okay.
好的。

115
And now, well, actually going back to pancakes, no pancake is possible to eat unless you put syrup on it, right?
现在，实际上回到煎饼，没有煎饼是可以吃的，除非你在上面放糖浆，对吧？

116
Well, some people might disagree.
嗯，有些人可能不同意。

117
I know a lot of people who eat pancakes with honey or with butter.
我知道很多人吃煎饼时用蜂蜜或黄油。

118
True.
说得对。

119
But the best, I think, is with syrup.
但我认为最好的还是糖浆。

120
And syrup is basically liquid sugar.
糖浆基本上是液体糖。

121
And you put it on your pancakes to make them sweeter.
你把它放在煎饼上，让它们更甜。

122
Okay.
好的。

123
Actually, it's the same thing as honey, basically, except that it doesn't come from bees.
实际上，它和蜂蜜基本上是一样的，只是它不是来自蜜蜂。

124
Right.
对。

125
So real syrup, we say maple syrup, comes from maple trees and you tap the tree and it comes out.
所以真正的糖浆，我们说枫糖浆，来自枫树，你在树上打孔，它就流出来。

126
It's very, very, very sweet.
它非常非常甜。

127
But we also have syrup you can buy at the store, which is man-made.
但我们也有可以在商店买的糖浆，是人造的。

128
Yeah, it's basically just sugar.
是的，基本上就是糖。

129
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

130
So that's what we have with pancakes usually.
所以这就是我们通常和煎饼一起吃的东西。

131
But why don't we go back, listen to our dialogue again.
