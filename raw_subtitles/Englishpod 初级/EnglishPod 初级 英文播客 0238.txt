But on this occasion, we're going to talk a little bit about yourself and your life.

16
I'd like to get a little bit of an idea of your background.
我想了解一下您的背景。

17
Yes, of course.
是的，当然。

18
Well, as you can see from the resume, I'm 27 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, although our family moved to London when I was quite young, at around 16.
如您所见，我27岁，出生在纽约布鲁克林，虽然我们的家人在我很小的时候，大约16岁时搬到了伦敦。

Ah, I see.
啊，我明白了。

20
So you were actually educated in Europe.

21
Yes, precisely.
是的，确切地说。

22
Although I was born in the U.S., I would definitely call London home.

23
But as you see, I've actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country.
但如您所见，我实际上花了很多时间在不同国家之间移动。

34
So why don't we take a look at five key words that we have prepared for you on Language Takeaway.
那么我们为什么不看看我们为您准备的五个关键词呢？

35
Language Takeaway.
语言要点。

36
Alright, so the first word that we have is right when Mr. Parsons talked to Ms. Childs, and he said that he was very impressed with her resume.
好的，第一个词是当Parsons先生与Childs女士交谈时，他说他对她的简历印象深刻。

37
Alright, so someone says, I'm impressed when they think that something that you did or something about you is very interesting or good or better than most people's.
好的，所以当某人说“我很印象深刻”时，他们认为您做的事情或您身上的某些东西非常有趣或好，或者比大多数人更好。

38
That's right, so you're kind of amazed, you're kind of, you're like, wow, right?
没错，所以您有点惊讶，您会说，哇，对吧？

39
And so this is an adjective.
所以这是一个形容词。

40
I am impressed.
我很印象深刻。

41
That's right.
没错。

42
So teachers sometimes say this.
所以老师有时会这样说。

44

45
Parents say this too, friends, family.

So basically this is a way to say good job, wow.
所以基本上这是说“干得好，哇”的一种方式。

47
Right, and there's also a verb.
对，还有一个动词。

48
So this is the adjective to be impressed, and the verb form would be to impress someone.
所以这是形容词“印象深刻”，而动词形式是“给某人留下印象”。

49
So that's obviously if you impress your teacher by studying, your teacher will be impressed.
所以显然如果您通过学习给老师留下了印象，您的老师会感到印象深刻。

50
That's right.
没错。

51
And following that, Mr. Parson has some questions about Ms. Child's background.
接下来，Parsons先生对Childs女士的背景有一些问题。

52
That's right.
没错。

53
He asked her for a brief overview of her background.
他问她能否简要概述一下她的背景。

54
So we have two interesting words there.
所以我们有两个有趣的词。

55
An overview.
概述。

56
What is an overview?
概述是什么？

57
An overview is like a summary.
概述就像是一个总结。

58
It's basically a way to ask for someone to give you a lot of information in very few words.
基本上是请求某人用很少的词给您提供大量信息的一种方式。

59
That's right.
没错。

60
So you don't really want too much detail.

62
You just want a brief summary.

63
Right.
对。

So not, I was born on August 11th in 1979, and I was, and then I went into this, and no, this is basic, simple, you know, this is where I'm from, this is where I went to school, the end.
所以不是，我在1979年8月11日出生，然后我进入这个，然后不，这基本上是简单的，您知道的，这是我来自哪里，这是我上学的地方，结束。

65
And well, he wanted a brief overview of her background.
而且，他想要她背景的简要概述。

66
What exactly is her background?
她的背景到底是什么？

67
Well, think about the word back.
嗯，想想“背景”这个词。

68
Okay, that means behind.
好吧，这意味着在后面。

69
Or in this case, background is your personal history.

70
So you could ask someone, what's your background?

71
It means where are you from?
这意味着您来自哪里？

72
Or, you know, what have you been doing up to up to now in your life?

That's right.

74
And precisely when he asked her about her background, now she's starting to talk about her her life that in general terms, as we said, it's an overview.
而且当他问她的背景时，她开始谈论她的生活，通常来说，这是一个概述。

75
So she said that she's 27, and she's from Brooklyn, etc.
所以她说她27岁，来自布鲁克林，等等。

76
So she starts giving very general information about herself and her life.
所以她开始提供关于自己和她生活的非常一般的信息。

77
Exactly.
正是如此。

78
So when she starts to do this, Mr. Parson has more specific questions about her life because he wants to know details.
所以当她开始这样做时，Parsons先生对她的生活有了更具体的问题，因为他想知道细节。

79
So he asks her then where she was educated.
所以他接着问她在哪里接受教育。

80
So this this phrase to be educated is very important.
所以“接受教育”这个短语非常重要。

81
That's right.
没错。

82
So he's asking her you studied in Europe.
所以他在问她，您是在欧洲学习的。

83
That's right.
没错。

To be educated means to have someone teach you or to go to school somewhere.

Okay, so at the very beginning, Mr. Parsons is continuing what he was saying in our first part.
好的，所以在一开始，帕森斯先生继续他在第一部分中所说的内容。

149
So Mr. Parsons is talking about Rebecca's resume, and he says, someone, the secretary, she passed it on to me.
所以帕森斯先生在谈论丽贝卡的简历，他说，有人，秘书，她把它转给了我。

150
So this verb, to pass on.

151
This is really important.

152
What does this mean?
这是什么意思？

153
Well, the secretary, Ms. Childs, passed on Rebecca's resume.
嗯，秘书查尔德小姐把丽贝卡的简历转交给了我。

154
That basically means Ms. Childs received it, and she didn't keep it.

155
She passed it on, or she gave it to another person, in this case, Mr. Parsons.
她转交了，或者说她把它给了另一个人，在这种情况下是帕森斯先生。

156
Okay, so this implies, this shows that something doesn't stay with one person, like you said, Marco, but it moves from one person to another person.
好的，所以这意味着，这表明某样东西不会停留在一个人身上，就像你说的，马尔科，而是从一个人转移到另一个人。

157
So for example, my mother told me to pass this message on to you.
所以例如，我母亲让我把这个消息转告给你。

158
The message is not for me, it's for you.
这个消息不是给我的，而是给你的。

159
I think also with physical traits, like maybe if your mother had green eyes, you can maybe say, my mom passed on her eye color on to me.
我想在身体特征上也是如此，比如如果你母亲有绿色眼睛，你可以说，我妈妈把她的眼睛颜色传给了我。

160
That's right.
没错。

161
So you got it from her.
所以你是从她那里得到的。

162
All right, so that's what happened with the resume.
好的，所以这就是简历的情况。

163
And he said, well, she passed it on, and I've had the chance to look it over.
他提到，她转交了，我有机会看了一下。

164
Okay, so think about this as a chunk, as a group of words that we use together to look something over.
好的，所以把这个视为一个词组，我们一起使用来查看某样东西。

165
We can say, hey, Marco, when you have a minute, can you look this over for me?
我们可以说，嘿，马尔科，当你有空的时候，可以帮我看一下这个吗？

166
Okay, so that means to examine or to take a look.

167
Take a look at, that's right.

168
So to look something over or to look it over.

All right, so basically to examine, maybe in close detail, right?
好的，基本上是仔细检查，也许是详细阅读，对吧？

170
You actually take the time to read it.
你确实花时间去阅读它。

171
That's right.
没错。

172
Okay.
好的。

173
And then later on, they started talking about her background.
然后后来，他们开始谈论她的背景。

174
As we know, she was from Brooklyn, she grew up in Brooklyn, and then she moved to London.
正如我们所知，她来自布鲁克林，她在布鲁克林长大，然后搬到了伦敦。

175
And so Rebecca described how she spent most of her life moving from country to country.
所以丽贝卡描述了她大部分时间在不同国家之间移动。

176
Okay, from country to country.
好的，从一个国家到另一个国家。

177
This means that she moved to many different countries.
这意味着她搬到了许多不同的国家。

178
Okay, so if I live in America all my life, I never moved from country to country.
好的，所以如果我一辈子都住在美国，我就没有从一个国家搬到另一个国家。

179
You could say this about many different things, from place to place, from town to town.
你可以对许多不同的事情这样说，从一个地方到另一个地方，从一个城镇到另一个城镇。

180
It means that you live in one, you go from one place to another.
这意味着你住在一个地方，然后从一个地方去另一个地方。

181
That's right.
没错。

182
So as you said, if you replace the noun country, you can say from town to town.
所以正如你所说，如果你替换名词国家，你可以说从城镇到城镇。

183
You can even say from house to house.
你甚至可以说从房子到房子。

184
I went from house to house asking for money.
我从房子到房子乞讨。

185
That's right.
没错。

187
Exactly.
正是如此。

188
So from something to something.
所以从某样东西到某样东西。

189
And for our final phrase, she was talking about how she's moved around so much that she's actually ready to settle down.
在我们的最后一个短语中，她谈到她搬来搬去太多，以至于她实际上准备安定下来。

190
Okay, to settle down.
好的，安定下来。

191
This is a really important phrase, and I think it's something a lot of people do when they're maybe in their 30s or 40s.
这是一个非常重要的短语，我认为这是很多人在30或40岁时会做的事情。

192
They don't want to move anymore.
他们不想再搬了。

193
So to settle down means to stay in one place.
所以安定下来意味着待在一个地方。

194
Exactly.
正是如此。

195
So you stay in one place.
所以你待在一个地方。

196
And it can have a lot of different meanings as well.
这也可以有很多不同的含义。

197
For example, to get married, many people say that's settling down.
例如，结婚，很多人说那是安定下来。

198
It means you want to stay in one place and have a family.
这意味着你想待在一个地方并组建家庭。

199
Or to buy a house because it means that you will live there for a long time.
或者买一栋房子，因为这意味着你会在那儿住很长时间。

200
Exactly.
正是如此。

201
So to settle down.
所以安定下来。

202
So a lot of interesting phrases there, a lot of words.
这里有很多有趣的短语，很多词汇。

203
And this is, as we said, part two of our series.
这是我们系列的第二部分。

204
So I think it would be worthy for us to listen to this dialogue one last time.
我认为我们应该最后再听一次这个对话。

205

没错。

241
So part three, we're going to take a look at your educational background.
所以在第三部分，我们将看看你的教育背景。

242
And it's going to be very important, because I think in many interviews, people have a hard time describing what they studied, or maybe describing exactly what they did during university or college or master's degree or something.
这将非常重要，因为我认为在许多面试中，人们很难描述他们所学的内容，或者准确描述他们在大学、学院或硕士学位期间所做的事情。

243
