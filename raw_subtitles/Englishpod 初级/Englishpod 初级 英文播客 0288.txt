On top of all of that, I've heard it hurts a lot.
更重要的是，我听说这很痛。

22
Really?

23
Of course.
当然。

24
They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink.
他们使用一种带针的机器，刺破你的皮肤并注入墨水。

25
Oh, I didn't know that.
哦，我不知道这一点。

26
I thought they just painted on your skin or something.
我以为他们只是涂在你的皮肤上。

27
I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos.
我觉得你应该重新考虑一下，做更多关于纹身的研究。

28
Also, find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure that you use sterilized needles and the place is hygienic.

Maybe I should just get a tongue-piercing.

30
Ew!
呃！

31
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at five key words that we've picked out for you on Language Takeaway.
好吧，我们回来了，现在让我们看看我们为你挑选的五个关键词。

32
So, the first phrase that we have here on Language Takeaway is indelible ink.
所以，Language Takeaway上的第一个短语是不可去除的墨水。

33
That's right.
没错。

34
When you get a tattoo, they draw it on your skin with indelible ink.
当你纹身时，他们用不可去除的墨水在你的皮肤上画。

35
Okay, well ink is what you find in a pen, so when you write, you write with ink.
好吧，墨水是你在笔中找到的东西，所以当你写字时，你是用墨水写的。

36
And this is something that you can also paint with, but in this case, we're talking about indelible ink, so that means it's going to be permanent in your skin.
这也是你可以用来绘画的东西，但在这种情况下，我们谈论的是不可去除的墨水，这意味着它会在你的皮肤上永久存在。

37
So something that is indelible means that you cannot delete or erase.
所以不可去除的东西意味着你无法删除或擦掉。

38
That's right, you can't take it away.
没错，你不能把它去掉。

39
Okay, indelible ink.
好的，不可去除的墨水。

40
Or obviously, if you get a tattoo with indelible ink, if you want to get it removed, now you can with laser treatment.
或者显然，如果你用不可去除的墨水纹身，如果你想去掉它，现在可以通过激光治疗去掉。

41
Okay, so laser treatment uses this very strong light to burn the ink out of your skin.
好吧，激光治疗使用非常强的光来烧掉你皮肤上的墨水。

42
And it is something that you actually have to go and do many, many times to get the tattoo removed.
而且这是你实际上需要去做很多次才能去掉纹身的东西。

43
I've also heard that it's very painful.
我也听说这非常痛。

44
Yeah, I've heard that it hurts a lot, more than getting the tattoo.
是的，我听说这比纹身更痛。

45
Right, so laser removal or laser treatment is something that you do when you want to take a tattoo off your body.
对，所以激光去除或激光治疗是你想要去掉身体上的纹身时所做的事情。

46
I think they also use laser treatment to remove, maybe you have stains on your skin, like from the sun, or even to remove hair, I heard.
我想他们也使用激光治疗去除，也许你皮肤上有污渍，比如阳光造成的，甚至是去除毛发，我听说过。

47
Yeah, laser hair removal is something that many people do to take away some of the hair on their bodies that they don't like.
是的，激光脱毛是许多人用来去掉他们不喜欢的身体毛发的东西。

48
Okay, so obviously because tattoos are forever, this friend is asking this other person to reconsider and do some more research about tattoos.
好吧，显然因为纹身是永恒的，这位朋友在让另一个人重新考虑并做更多关于纹身的研究。

49
Well, to consider something means to think about it.
好吧，考虑某事意味着思考它。

50
So to reconsider means to think about it again.
所以重新考虑意味着再次思考它。

51
Right, so if you're going to make a big decision, you should reconsider what you're going to do.
对，所以如果你要做一个重大决定，你应该重新考虑你要做的事情。

52
For example, I really want to have a hamburger for dinner, but maybe I should reconsider because hamburgers aren't very healthy, maybe I should decide on a salad or something.
例如，我真的想吃汉堡作为晚餐，但也许我应该重新考虑，因为汉堡不是很健康，也许我应该选择沙拉或其他东西。

53
Very good, okay.
非常好，好的。

54
So to reconsider.
所以重新考虑。

55
Now obviously when we have a tattoo done, when we get a tattoo, they use this little machine that has a needle inside and it vibrates very, very fast and it kind of injects the ink.
显然，当我们纹身时，他们使用这种带针的小机器，它非常快速地振动，并注入墨水。

56
So the friend tells this person to make sure that when they use this machine, they use sterilized needles.
所以朋友告诉这个人确保在使用这个机器时使用消毒过的针头。

57
Okay, so needles are those very small little things that go into your skin, they hurt.
好吧，针头就是那些非常小的东西，刺入你的皮肤，会很痛。

58
When you get a shot, the doctor will use a needle as well.
当你打针时，医生也会使用针头。

59
But a sterilized needle is a needle that is clean.
但消毒过的针头是干净的针头。

60
So something that is sterilized means clean.
所以消毒的东西意味着干净。

61
That's right, but it's clean for medical use.
没错，但它是用于医疗用途的干净。

62
That means that maybe someone used alcohol or even fire to clean something.
这意味着也许有人用酒精或甚至火来清洁某物。

63
Okay, so as you said, it needs to go through a process to be sterilized.
好吧，正如你所说，它需要经过一个过程才能消毒。

64
Like if you wash your dishes, they're not sterilized.
就像如果你洗碗，它们并不是消毒过的。

65
No, but if you are getting surgery on your body, the doctor is going to cut you open, he will use sterilized tools.
不，但如果你在身体上做手术，医生会切开你，他会使用消毒过的工具。

66
Okay, very good.
好吧，非常好。

67
And moving on to our last word, very much related to sterilized needles.
继续到我们的最后一个词，与消毒针头非常相关。

68
We're talking about something that is hygienic to make sure that everything is hygienic when you get a tattoo done.
我们在谈论的是卫生，以确保在你纹身时一切都是卫生的。

69
Okay, well something that is hygienic is clean.
好吧，卫生的东西是干净的。

70
So if you have a baby, you want to make sure that the room that the baby is in is very hygienic, so you clean it very often.
所以如果你有一个婴儿，你想确保婴儿所在的房间是非常卫生的，所以你经常清洁它。

71
And maybe use some sterilizer to clean the different surfaces and things like that because babies can get sick easily.
也许使用一些消毒剂来清洁不同的表面和东西，因为婴儿很容易生病。

72
That's right.
没错。

73

74
