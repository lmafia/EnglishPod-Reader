好的，通常如果你把它们送到干洗店，他们会熨烫它们并上浆。

86
Okay, so to starch something means to use some powder or chemical to make something stiff or hard.
好的，所以给某物上浆意味着使用一些粉末或化学品使某物变得坚硬或硬挺。

87
So the noun or the chemical is also called starch.
所以名词或化学品也叫上浆。

88
Exactly, so you think of a shirt with many buttons that a man wears to work.
正是如此，所以你想象一个男人上班时穿的有很多扣子的衬衫。

89
He has a collar around his neck and that needs to be high and tall.
他脖子上有一个领子，需要高高的。

90
It can't be flat and wrinkled.
