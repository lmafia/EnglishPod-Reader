152
So it's basically a phrase that's kind of a metaphor to say, you know what, I'm going to tell everyone that I am gay or lesbian, right?
所以这基本上是一个隐喻，意味着你知道，我要告诉每个人我是一名同性恋或女同性恋，对吧？

153
That's right.

154
Well, it's because in English oftentimes a closet is a place where we keep secrets.

160
It's a secret that I keep.

162
Or I have two kids and I never told you guys.
或者我有两个孩子，我从未告诉过你们。

163
Right, so those are the skeletons in the closet, but in this case it's to come out of the closet and that's always related to telling somebody for the first time that you are gay or lesbian.
对，所以那些是衣橱里的骷髅，但在这种情况下是出柜，这总是与第一次告诉某人你是同性恋或女同性恋有关。

164
That's right, and we don't say it about being straight, which is the opposite, which is men who love women and women who love men.
没错，我们不说关于直男直女的出柜，那是相反的，男人爱女人，女人爱男人。

165
You don't say it about coming out of the closet there.
你不说关于那里的出柜。

166
You say it about being gay or lesbian.
你说的是关于同性恋或女同性恋。

167

175
Take up an art class or something?
上一门艺术课之类的？

176
Well, first of all, I've decided to stop smoking.
首先，我决定戒烟。

177
It's not that I'm pinching pennies or anything, it's just that I've been smoking since I was 16 and I think it's time to stop.
不是因为我在省钱，而是因为我从16岁开始吸烟，我觉得是时候停止了。

178
I'm with you on that one.
我支持你。

179
Anything else you're planning on doing?
还有其他计划吗？

180

我决定出柜。

182
It's about time.
是时候了。

183
Alright, we're back.
好吧，我们回来了。

184
So this is very interesting and these phrases are so common because if you have a fight with somebody, you say, you know what, let's just wipe the slate clean and start all over again or let's turn over a new leaf, let's stop fighting.
所以这非常有趣，这些短语非常常见，因为如果你和某人打架，你会说，你知道吗，让我们洗清旧账，重新开始，或者翻开新的一页，停止争吵。

185
And especially in New Year's, right?
尤其是在新年，对吧？

186

188
Well, the new year, you can use a new calendar, you can take a fresh perspective on your life.
好吧，新年，你可以使用新日历，可以对生活有新的看法。

189
It's refreshing and I think it's good that we do this, we evaluate the things that make us happy and we evaluate the things that make us unhappy and part of that means turning over a new leaf.
这很清新，我觉得我们这样做很好，我们评估让我们快乐的事情，评估让我们不快乐的事情，而其中一部分意味着翻开新的一页。

190
Part of it also means apologizing to people or trying to make the relationships in your life healthier.
其中一部分也意味着向人道歉或努力让你生活中的关系更健康。

191
And I think it's very healthy that the person in this dialogue says, listen, I'm finally going to come out of the closet.
我觉得这个对话中的人说，听着，我终于要出柜了，这非常健康。

192
I'm going to be honest with my friends and family.
我会对我的朋友和家人诚实。

193
And that's really interesting because as we said, to come out of the closet is a phrase used in English and mostly related only in this context, so you might see it in TV shows or in a movie.
这真的很有趣，因为正如我们所说，出柜是一个在英语中使用的短语，主要只与这个上下文相关，所以你可能会在电视节目或电影中看到它。

194
But it's an interesting topic, still debatable all over the world about gay marriages and things like that.
但这是一个有趣的话题，关于同性婚姻等问题在全世界仍然存在争论。

195
