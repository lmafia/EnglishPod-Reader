If you're interested in buying furniture for your house, you should like this lesson.

Pay attention while you're listening to some of the pieces of furniture that we talk about.
听的时候请注意我们提到的一些家具。

10
We'll be back in a moment to talk more about them.
我们稍后会回来讨论更多。

11
How about this floor lamp?

12
Fine, just get it.

13
We have been shopping for furniture for five hours.
我们已经逛了五个小时的家具店。

14

19
Pick me up in about an hour because I think I'll also get a bean bag and a dining set.

25
Alright, we're back.
好吧，我们回来了。

26
So now what we're going to do is, since we have so much vocab, we're going to take a look at this language in two parts.
现在我们要做的是，由于我们有很多词汇，我们将把这门语言分成两部分来看看。

27
So now let's go to language takeaway part one.
现在让我们进入语言要点第一部分。

28
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

29
Okay, so everyone's heard of a lamp, a light.
好的，大家都听说过灯，光。

30
This is something that you use to read in the dark, for example, to see in the dark.
这是你用来在黑暗中阅读的东西，例如，在黑暗中看东西。

31
But in this case, we have a floor lamp.
但在这种情况下，我们有一个落地灯。

32
Floor lamp.
落地灯。

33
So this is a lamp you put on the floor?
这是放在地上的灯吗？

34
Yes, exactly.
是的，没错。

35
So usually this lamp would be a lot taller.
通常这个灯会高很多。

36
It'll maybe be like a meter taller, a meter and a half maybe.
可能高一米、一米半。

37
Okay, so for example, in your living room next to your sofa, you might have a very tall floor lamp.
好的，例如，在你的客厅沙发旁边，你可能会有一个非常高的落地灯。

38
This allows you to get more light in the room.
这可以让房间里有更多的光。

39
Right, so sometimes you know the center light in your living room is not enough.
对，有时候你知道客厅的中央灯光不够。

40
You want maybe more light in the corners, you get a little floor lamp.
你可能想在角落里有更多的光，所以你可以放一个小落地灯。

41
Okay, so that's the first item.
好的，这就是第一个项目。

42
Now that we go to the bedroom, we are getting an armoire.
现在我们去卧室，买一个衣柜。

43
Okay, an armoire.
好的，一个衣柜。

44
This is kind of like a wardrobe.
这有点像一个衣橱。

45
It's a piece of furniture we use to keep clothes in, but usually they're hanging clothes.
这是我们用来存放衣物的家具，通常是挂着的衣物。

46
Okay, so a closet is usually inside a wall, right?
好的，衣橱通常是在墙内，对吧？

47
Right, so a closet's a part of your house.
对，所以衣橱是你房子的一部分。

48
It's not furniture.
它不是家具。

49
Right, so an armoire is the same as a closet, but it's not in the house, like in the walls.
对，所以衣柜和衣橱是一样的，但它不在房子里，比如在墙里。

50
It's outside.
它在外面。

51
It's a piece of furniture.
它是一件家具。

52
It's a big box.
它是一个大箱子。

53
Yeah, I could pick it up and move it.
是的，我可以把它拿起来移动。

54
Okay, yes, so an armoire is a tall place to keep clothing.
好的，是的，所以衣柜是一个高的地方用来存放衣物。

55
Usually you hang your clothes.
通常你挂上你的衣服。

56
You hang your shirts and your dresses and your coats.
你挂上你的衬衫、裙子和外套。

57
And moving on, we have a dresser.
接下来我们有一个梳妆台。

58
Now this seems pretty straightforward.
这看起来很简单。

59
To get dressed, you have a dresser?
要穿衣服，你有一个梳妆台？

60
Yeah, it makes a lot of sense, but there is a big difference here between an armoire and a dresser.
是的，这很有道理，但衣柜和梳妆台之间有很大的区别。

61
A dresser is usually drawers.
梳妆台通常有抽屉。

62
So you keep your sweaters, your shirts, your socks, your underwear in a dresser.
所以你把毛衣、衬衫、袜子、内衣放在梳妆台里。

63
Okay, so an armoire, as you said, usually you hang your shirts or your pants.
好的，正如你所说，衣柜通常是挂着你的衬衫或裤子。

64
It's for hanging stuff only.
它只用于挂东西。

65
A dresser is you have different drawers where you can put your socks, your boxer shorts, and any other things that you keep.
梳妆台是你有不同的抽屉，可以放袜子、内裤和其他你存放的东西。

66
Exactly.
没错。

67
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

68
So two very handy words, and that's what makes the difference between a closet.
所以这两个非常实用的词，这就是它们与衣橱的区别。

69
So many people say, oh, well, it's just a closet.
很多人说，哦，那只是一个衣橱。

70
A closet is different.
衣橱是不同的。

71
No, a closet is actually part of your house.
不，衣橱实际上是你房子的一部分。

72
It's a part of the wall.
它是墙的一部分。

73
Maybe it has a door.
也许它有一扇门。

74
Yeah, there's a big difference there.
是的，这里有很大的区别。

75
Okay, so moving on, we have a nightstand that's also usually in the bedroom.
好的，接下来我们有一个床头柜，通常也在卧室里。

76
That's right.
没错。

77
So I always wondered, why is it called a nightstand and not a daystand?
我一直想知道，为什么叫床头柜而不是日间柜？

78
Well, a nightstand, it makes sense.
嗯，床头柜，这很有道理。

79
It usually has a lamp on it, a light on it.
它上面通常有一个灯，一个光。

80
And so when you're in bed and you want to read, you have a nightstand next to you to put your lamp so you can turn the lamp on.
所以当你在床上想读书时，你有一个床头柜在你旁边，可以放灯，这样你就可以打开灯。

81
Usually I also keep my books here.
通常我也会把书放在这里。

82
So when I'm reading, I put my books down, then I go to sleep.
所以当我在阅读时，我把书放下，然后去睡觉。

83
Some people also keep their glasses and their alarm clock on a nightstand.
有些人还会把眼镜和闹钟放在床头柜上。

84
Okay.
好的。

85
It's a small table that stands next to your bed.
这是一个小桌子，放在你的床旁边。

86
Very good.
非常好。

87
And our last word for language takeaway part one, we have a coffee table.
我们语言要点第一部分的最后一个词是咖啡桌。

88
Okay, so with the coffee table, Marco, we're moving back into the living room.
好的，关于咖啡桌，Marco，我们回到客厅。

89
And in the living room, you have a sofa, you have some chairs.
在客厅里，你有沙发，有一些椅子。

90
You need a table, but you don't want a big table.
你需要一张桌子，但你不想要一张大桌子。

91
You want a small table or a very short table.

92
This is a coffee table.
这就是咖啡桌。

93
It's called a coffee table.
它叫咖啡桌。

94
I'm not really sure why.
我不太确定为什么。

95
I guess because if you're having coffee in the living room, this is where you put the coffee.
我想是因为如果你在客厅喝咖啡，这就是你放咖啡的地方。

96
That's right.
没错。

97
And we even have something called coffee table books.
我们甚至有一种叫做咖啡桌书的东西。

98
These are big, beautiful books, hardback books that have many pictures that you put on your coffee table to look nice.
这些是大而美丽的书，精装书，里面有很多图片，你把它们放在咖啡桌上，看起来很好。

99
It's not for you actually to read all the time.
这些书并不是你实际要一直阅读的。

100
I read them, but it's more important to use these books to look nice.
我会读它们，但更重要的是用这些书来装饰。

101
Yes.
是的。

102
And this is interesting though, because in many other countries, they're not really called a coffee table.
这很有趣，因为在许多其他国家，它们并不真的叫咖啡桌。

103
So the direct translation wouldn't really help you in many cases.
所以直接翻译在很多情况下并没有帮助。

104
Like I know, I think in Chinese, it's called a tea table, not a coffee table.
我知道，在中文里，它叫茶几，而不是咖啡桌。

105
That makes sense.
这很有道理。

106
Right.
对。

107
Or like I know in Spanish, it's just called a center table.
或者我知道在西班牙语中，它只是叫中心桌。

108
Okay.
好的。

109
So this is basically the low table you have in your living room next to your sofa, in front of your sofa, actually.
所以这基本上是你在客厅里沙发旁边的低桌子，实际上是在沙发前面。

110
So you can have tea or coffee and read books.
你可以喝茶或咖啡，读书。

111
Or put your feet up while you're watching TV.
或者在看电视时把脚放上去。

112
Not in my house when I was a kid.
我小时候在我家可不行。

113
All right.
好吧。

114
So now why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be returning a little bit with more vocab.
现在我们为什么不回去，再听一遍对话，然后我们会回来，带来更多词汇。

我要回家把这个床头柜、咖啡桌和双人沙发放下，然后你再找其他东西。

123

But it doesn't mean that you're going to go to that place and stay there.
但这并不意味着你要去那个地方并停留在那里。
