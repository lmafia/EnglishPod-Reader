And today we're talking about something that I haven't actually seen in a long time but is very common in the States, especially in suburban areas.
今天我们要谈论一些我很久没见过但在美国，尤其是郊区非常常见的事情。

6
That's right.
没错。

7
We're going to get a subscription as the title of the lesson says.
我们要订阅，就像课题所说的。

8
So we're going to subscribe to magazines, newspapers, stuff like that.
所以我们要订阅杂志、报纸等。

9
Right, so there's a guy coming around to everyone's houses and he is offering different magazine subscriptions.
对，有个家伙到每个人家里，提供不同的杂志订阅。

10
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.
让我们来听听今天的对话，稍后我们会回来讨论发生了什么。

11

16
I wish I could, but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking.
我希望可以，但我得遛狗和完成烹饪。

17
So if you'd excuse me.
所以请您见谅。

18
We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking.
我们有很多关于烹饪的杂志。

19
This one, for example, is a bi-monthly publication with recipes from all over the world.
这个，比如说，是一本双月刊，里面有来自世界各地的食谱。

20
Well, that would be kind of useful.
嗯，这听起来挺有用的。

21
Do you have any other cooking magazines?
你们还有其他烹饪杂志吗？

22
Sure do.
当然有。

23
This one is a quarterly publication, but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas.
这个是季刊，但每期都有超过200页的彩色食谱，还有很多家居装饰的点子。

24
Wow, this is nice.
哇，这不错。

25
Okay, sign me up for both publications.
好的，我要订阅这两本杂志。

26
You mentioned you have a dog.
你提到你有一只狗。

27
Most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care, pet shops, and even pet sitters.
大多数宠物主人会订阅这本每周的通讯，里面有关于狗护理、宠物商店甚至宠物看护的信息。

28
That's exactly what I needed.
这正是我需要的。

29
What else do you have?
你们还有什么？

30
Well, I also have... Alright, we're back.
嗯，我还有…… 好吧，我们回来了。

31
So as you saw, Mike is, well, not very excited to be selling subscriptions, but he has magazines about almost everything, I think.
正如你所看到的，Mike 并不是很兴奋地在卖订阅，但我觉得他几乎有关于所有主题的杂志。

32
That's right.
没错。

33
And he's actually a pretty good salesperson because it sounds like this customer is going to buy quite a few magazines.
而且他实际上是个不错的销售员，因为听起来这个顾客会买很多杂志。

34
Exactly.
确切地说。

35
And so he used a lot of interesting vocabulary related to magazines and subscriptions.
他使用了很多与杂志和订阅相关的有趣词汇。

36
So let's take a look at those now in Language Takeaway.
现在让我们在语言收获中看看这些词。

37
Okay, so this first word is one that we've already said a couple of times in today's lesson.
好的，第一个词是我们今天课程中已经提到过几次的。

38
This is the topic of the lesson.
这是课程的主题。

39
The word is subscription.
这个词是订阅。

40
Okay, so if you get a subscription, that means that you are paying money to receive something every month, every week, et cetera.
好的，如果你订阅，意味着你每月、每周等支付钱以接收某物。

41
That's right.
没错。

42
So the time is fixed.
所以时间是固定的。

43
Like you said, it could be weekly.
就像你说的，可以是每周。

44
The time could change.
时间可以变化。

45
But basically, you have a promise that after you pay this money, you will receive something periodically.
但基本上，你有一个承诺，在你支付这笔钱后，你会定期收到某物。

46
Right.
对。

47
And so there are many things that you could have a subscription for, not just magazines.
所以有很多东西可以订阅，不仅仅是杂志。

48
Newspapers come in subscriptions.
报纸也是订阅的。

49
That's right.
没错。

50
Or maybe you pay for satellite TV.
或者你可能为卫星电视付费。

51
That's a subscription.
那也是订阅。

52
So you pay every month and you receive channels, like lots of channels.
所以你每月付费，接收频道，像很多频道。

53
Exactly.
确切地说。

54
Or hopefully English Pod, you receive by subscription or you pay the subscription fee.
或者希望 English Pod，你是通过订阅接收的，或者你支付订阅费。

55
Exactly.
确切地说。

56
So with English Pod, you subscribe.
所以在 English Pod，你订阅。

57
That would be the verb.
那是动词。

58
A subscription is the noun.
订阅是名词。

59
You subscribe to a service, like a newspaper magazine, and you receive the magazine or the service every month, every week, every day, depending on what the subscription is like.
你订阅一个服务，比如报纸杂志，然后你每月、每周、每天接收杂志或服务，具体取决于订阅的内容。

60
Okay.
好的。

61
And so because subscriptions come at different time frames, so for example, English Pod, we have lessons three times a week.
所以因为订阅有不同的时间框架，比如说，English Pod，我们每周有三次课程。

62
Newspapers are often times every day.
报纸通常是每天。

63
They come in different periods of time.
它们有不同的时间周期。

64
So we call these kinds of publications periodicals.
所以我们称这些出版物为期刊。

65
Okay.
好的。

66
So for example, as you said, a newspaper, it comes every day.
比如说，正如你所说，报纸每天出版。

67
That's the period of time.
这是时间周期。

68
So it's a periodical.
所以它是期刊。

69
The same as a magazine, sometimes they are weekly, sometimes they are monthly.
杂志也是，有时是每周，有时是每月。

70
Is a book a periodical pop quiz?
书是期刊吗？小测验。

71
No.
不是。

72
Okay.
好的。

73
No, because you only get it once.
不，因为你只得到一次。

74
Right.
对。

75
So basically, a periodical has to be something, I guess, that comes out every so often, a new version, a new edition, right?
所以基本上，期刊必须是某种我想是每隔一段时间就会出新版本、新版的东西，对吧？

76
It's continually updating.
它是持续更新的。

77
Okay.
好的。

78
So that is periodicals and subscriptions.
所以这就是期刊和订阅。

79
Now moving on to when he was trying to sell the magazines, he said, we have a great variety of magazines all about cooking.
现在继续，当他试图销售杂志时，他说，我们有很多关于烹饪的杂志。

80
So what is a variety?
那么，什么是多样性？

81
Variety is a great word.
多样性是一个很好的词。

82
It's a word I personally am a very big fan of.
这是我个人非常喜欢的一个词。

83
I like to have many choices to choose from.
我喜欢有很多选择。

84
So variety means something that has many options.
所以多样性意味着有很多选项。

85
For example, at the grocery store, there's a great variety of food.
例如，在杂货店，有各种各样的食物。

86
There are apples and crackers and cakes and wine.
有苹果、饼干、蛋糕和葡萄酒。

87
So variety means there are many different kinds of something.
所以多样性意味着有许多不同种类的东西。

88
Okay, so many choices.
好的，所以有很多选择。

89
So if you go to a bookstore, you can find a variety of books and magazines, for example.
所以如果你去书店，你可以找到各种各样的书和杂志。

90
All right, now moving on to, again, when we're talking about the period of time, how often she's going to get this cooking magazine, the one that he's showing her is a bimonthly publication.
好的，现在继续，当我们谈论时间周期时，她将多长时间收到这本烹饪杂志，他给她展示的这本是一本双月刊。

91
So what exactly does it mean if she receives a magazine bimonthly?
那么，如果她每两个月收到一次杂志，这到底是什么意思？

92
Okay, so this is a bit confusing in English.
好的，这在英语中有点混淆。

93
Bimonthly has two meanings, but what's important is the word by here or the prefix by.
双月刊有两个意思，但重要的是这里的字根“bi”或前缀“bi”。

94
That means two.
这意味着二。

95
Okay.
好的。

96
Okay, so we could say bimonthly, biweekly, biannually.
所以我们可以说双月刊、双周刊、双年刊。

97
These all mean two.
这些都意味着二。

98
So in this case, we're talking about something that I receive two times every month.
所以在这种情况下，我们谈论的是我每月收到两次的东西。

99
Okay, or it can be that you get it once every two months.
好的，或者也可以是你每两个月收到一次。

100
Okay, so that might be confusing.
好的，这可能会让人困惑。

101
Right.
对。

102
In the first case, let's just say that it's the month of October, and I have this great subscription to a magazine.
在第一种情况下，假设现在是十月，我有一个很棒的杂志订阅。

103
So in October, I will receive it two times.
所以在十月，我会收到两次。

104
Exactly.
正是如此。

105
So you get it twice.
所以你收到两次。

106
Or it could also mean that you receive the magazine in October, and then you don't receive another magazine until December.
或者也可能意味着你在十月收到杂志，然后直到十二月才收到另一本杂志。

107
So it's a bimonthly publication.
所以这是一本双月刊。

108
Every other month.
每隔一个月。

109
Every two months.
每两个月。

110
Right, so this is very confusing for us.
对，所以这对我们来说非常困惑。

111
It's probably confusing for you, but if you see this word bimonthly or biweekly, you should ask the person who's offering the subscription what kind they mean.
这可能对你也很困惑，但如果你看到这个词双月刊或双周刊，你应该问提供订阅的人他们的意思是什么。

112
Is it every month two times, or is it every other month?
是每个月两次，还是每隔一个月？

113
Mm-hmm.
嗯嗯。

114
All right, so exactly.
好的，正是如此。

115
Just remember the prefix bi means two, and then if it's bi-monthly, bi-annual, bi-weekly, you have to more or less make sure that they specify what they mean, because they can mean both, and that's how ambiguous this word is.
只需记住前缀“bi”意味着两个，然后如果是双月刊、双年刊、双周刊，你必须或多或少确保他们说明他们的意思，因为它们可以意味着两者，这就是这个词的模糊性。

116
It is, but the next one, the next one we have for you is not nearly as confusing.
确实如此，但下一个，我们为你准备的下一个词并没有那么困惑。

117
It's a very, very common word in both periodicals and sales, but also in and in marketing and business as well.
这是一个在期刊、销售、市场营销和商业中都非常常见的词。

118
Right, we're talking about a quarterly publication, or something that comes out once every quarter.
对，我们在谈论季度出版物，或者每个季度发布一次的东西。

119
Right, so if you think about a year, a year has 12 months, a quarter of a year is three months.
对，所以如果你考虑一年，一年有12个月，四分之一的年份是三个月。

120
Mm-hmm.
嗯嗯。

121
So the first quarter is January, February, March.
所以第一季度是1月、2月、3月。

122
Exactly.
正是如此。

123
So a quarterly publication means that you will get a magazine four times in one year.
所以季度出版物意味着你一年会收到四次杂志。

124
Okay, we could also talk about quarterly sales.
好的，我们也可以谈谈季度销售。

125
You know, this quarter our business did very well, but last quarter was not so good.
你知道，这个季度我们的业务表现很好，但上个季度就不太好。

126
So quarter means three months at a time.
所以季度意味着每次三个月。

127
Exactly, and for our last word on language takeaway today, we are talking about a weekly newsletter.
正是如此，对于我们今天语言学习的最后一个词，我们在谈论每周通讯。

128
So weekly is pretty straightforward.
所以每周是相当直接的。

129
You receive it once every week.
你每周收到一次。

130
That's right, so weekly publications are very common.
没错，所以每周出版物非常常见。

131
What is a newsletter?
什么是通讯？

132
A newsletter is important in periodicals because it's not a magazine, but it's not a letter either.
通讯在期刊中很重要，因为它不是杂志，但也不是信件。

133
It's basically short update, a couple of pages maybe, or even one page that's on a piece of paper, that gives you information about a group or a club or a community.
它基本上是一个简短的更新，可能几页，甚至一页，提供有关一个团体、俱乐部或社区的信息。

134
For example, we could say the EnglishPod newsletter comes out quarterly.
例如，我们可以说EnglishPod通讯是季度发布的。

135
Exactly.
正是如此。

136
Maybe in your offices you receive your company's newsletter, so usually they will... some companies will come out with a monthly or a quarterly newsletter where if you have many offices or many branches all over the country or the world, then you will receive updates or news about what's going on in other places within your same company.
也许在你的办公室，你会收到你公司的通讯，所以通常他们会... 一些公司会发布每月或季度的通讯，如果你在全国或全世界有许多办公室或分支机构，那么你将收到关于你同一公司其他地方发生的事情的更新或新闻。

137
That's right, so these are very useful for communication across the company.
没错，所以这些对于公司内部的沟通非常有用。

138
You can tell some people in your New York office that in Los Angeles we have a new cafeteria or a new employee.
你可以告诉你在纽约办公室的一些人，在洛杉矶我们有一个新的咖啡厅或一位新员工。

139
Exactly, so that is what a newsletter is basically for.
正是如此，所以这就是通讯的基本用途。

140
I think it's time now for us to listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to talk to you with four key phrases on Fluency Builder right after this.
