流利度构建器。

119
All right, so starting off, this is a very interesting phrase because we saw it in the first sentence and it says, let's go grab a bite to eat.
好吧，首先，这是一个非常有趣的短语，因为我们在第一句中看到了它，意思是，让我们去吃点东西。

120

Now for our next phrase, it's very important because I've noticed that a lot of our English learners make the mistake of using this phrase.

132
It's how about.
这是“怎么样”。

133
How about.
怎么样。

134
So in today's dialogue, the phrase is, how about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches?
在今天的对话中，这个短语是，我们回家准备几个三明治怎么样？

135
So how about is used as a suggestion is how do you feel or what do you think of going home and preparing a couple of sandwiches?
所以“怎么样”用作建议，意思是你觉得怎么样，或者你认为回家准备几个三明治怎么样？

136
So another way to say this is, why don't we go home and prepare some sandwiches?
另一种说法是，为什么我们不回家准备一些三明治呢？

137
Exactly.
正是如此。

138
But commonly, English learners make the mistake of using how about as a way of saying, how was it or how is it?

139
So for example, how about your weekend?

141
Okay.

Why don't you get another job?

152
So you can't say, how about your weekend?

你应该说，你的周末怎么样？

154
So there's a big difference there.

So in actually in England, they call French fries, they call them chips.

So if you're confused by the word chips or potato chips, and French fries, these are different things in different places.
如果你对“薯条”或“土豆片”和“薯条”这个词感到困惑，这在不同地方是不同的。

180
Or for a while they were called freedom fries.
