So to cook meat on a barbecue.

So that's cooking meat not in a stove, not with gas.

39
Usually it's under a fire or very warm intense heat coming from coals.
通常是在火下或来自煤炭的强烈热量下。

40
Exactly.
正是如此。

41
And so before we cook food, usually before we cook meat on the grill, before we barbecue it, we have to marinate it.
所以在我们烹饪食物之前，通常在我们在烤架上烹饪肉之前，我们必须腌制它。

42
Okay, so in this situation, the steaks and the chicken are already marinated.
好的，在这种情况下，牛排和鸡肉已经腌制好了。

43
Okay, so to marinate something or which is so to marinate something, which is a verb or the steaks and chickens are marinated, which is an adjective.
好的，腌制某样东西，或者说牛排和鸡肉是腌制的，前者是动词，后者是形容词。

So basically means that you have added spices and maybe some lemon juice, different herbs or salts to the meats in order to give it flavor before you cook them.
基本上意味着你已经添加了香料，也许还有一些柠檬汁、不同的香草或盐，以便在烹饪之前给肉增添风味。

Sometimes in Indian cooking, for example, you marinate with a yogurt sauce and you leave the meats in the refrigerator for a whole night.
有时在印度烹饪中，例如，你用酸奶酱腌制，并把肉放在冰箱里过夜。

So marinating or to marinate is a process to give flavor to food.

但在我们谈论汉堡包之后，我们讨论要烤多少热狗。

64
So the person says, we should cook a couple dozen hot dogs.
所以那个人说，我们应该烤几打热狗。

65
All right, so a dozen is 12 units of something.

67
We buy a dozen eggs, we buy 12 eggs.
