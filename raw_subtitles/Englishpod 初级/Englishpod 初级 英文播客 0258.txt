And today we have a lesson for you all about life at home and life with your parents.
今天我们有一节关于家庭生活和与父母生活的课程。

5
That's right.
没错。

6
We've all lived with our parents when we were younger, or maybe we still do.
我们小时候都和父母住在一起，或者现在仍然住在一起。

7
And of course, they have certain rules in the house.
当然，他们在家里有一些规则。

8
And, well, when you break those rules, something happens.
当你违反这些规则时，会发生一些事情。

9
There are consequences, and that's what's happening in today's dialogue.
会有后果，这就是今天对话中发生的事情。

10
So let's take a listen to this dialogue.
让我们来听听这个对话。

11
And when we come back, we'll be talking more about what's going on and what some of these words and phrases mean.
回来后，我们会讨论发生了什么，以及这些词和短语的意思。

12
Do you know what time it is?
你知道现在几点了吗？

13
Um, 10.
嗯，10点。

14
Get in this door, young man.
进这个门，年轻人。

15
It's midnight.
现在是午夜。

16
You are two hours past curfew.
你已经超过宵禁两个小时了。

17
I know, but it wasn't my fault.
我知道，但这不是我的错。

18
I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before 10, but she wouldn't leave the party.
我告诉Jennifer她必须在10点之前送我回家，但她不愿意离开派对。

19
I don't care.
我不在乎。

20
You are grounded for life, mister.
你被禁足了，先生。

21
Mom, that is so unfair.
妈妈，这太不公平了。

22
You know the rules, and you broke them.
你知道规则，你违反了它们。

23
No allowance and no TV for a week.
一周内没有零花钱，也不能看电视。

24
I usually never ground you, but this time I have to put my foot down.
我通常从不惩罚你，但这次我必须坚持立场。

25
What?
什么？

26
For being a couple of hours late?
只是晚了几个小时？

27
You have to be kidding.
你一定是在开玩笑。

28
I don't want to hear it.
我不想听。

29
Now go to your room.
现在去你的房间。

30
All right, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

31
So a very typical case, somebody, or the kid, returns home.
这是一个非常典型的案例，某人，或者说孩子，回到家。

32
It's too late, and now they're in trouble.
现在太晚了，他们惹上了麻烦。

33
Yes, his parents are not very happy.
是的，他的父母并不太高兴。

34
In this case, it's his mom who is telling him what the consequences will be.
在这种情况下，是他的妈妈在告诉他后果是什么。

35
So let's take a look at language takeaway and find out what some of these key words are.
让我们看看语言要点，找出一些关键词。

36
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

37
All right, so the first word that we're going to take a look is actually something that his mom said, and he said that you are two hours past curfew.
好的，我们要看的第一个词实际上是他妈妈说的，她说你已经超过宵禁两个小时了。

38
Curfew.
宵禁。

39
So curfew has to do specifically with the time when your parents expect you at home.
宵禁具体指的是父母希望你在家的时间。

40
That's right.
没错。

41
So if your curfew is 10 o'clock, you have to be home before or by 10 o'clock.
如果你的宵禁是10点，你必须在10点之前或10点到家。

42
Right.
对。

43
So in this case, if the boy's curfew is 10 o'clock and he arrives home at midnight, 12 o'clock, he's two hours past curfew.
所以在这种情况下，如果男孩的宵禁是10点，而他在午夜12点回家，他就超过了宵禁两个小时。

44
That's right.
没错。

45
And even sometimes cities or governments will implement certain curfews at certain times.
有时城市或政府会在特定时间实施某些宵禁。

46
That's right.
没错。

47
And I don't think adults really have curfews at home.
我认为成年人在家里并没有宵禁。

48
No, I don't think so.
不，我不这样认为。

49
It depends on what you want, but kids definitely have curfews.
这取决于你想要什么，但孩子们肯定有宵禁。

50
What happens, though, Marco, when you break curfew?
不过，Marco，当你违反宵禁时会发生什么？

51
So this is a very serious offense and you're going to get punished.
这是一个非常严重的罪行，你会受到惩罚。

52
And the way that we say this, usually parents to their children, you are grounded or you ground that kid.
我们通常对孩子说，你被禁足了。

53
OK, so you might have heard this word when talking about airplanes or flights at an airport.
好的，你可能在谈论飞机或机场航班时听过这个词。

54
The plane was grounded.
飞机被禁飞了。

55
It basically means it can't go anywhere.
这基本上意味着它不能去任何地方。

56
And so when you're talking about a kid or a person, you basically mean, OK, you're grounded, you can't go out with your friends, you can't go anywhere.
所以当你谈论一个孩子或一个人时，你基本上是说，好吧，你被禁足了，你不能和朋友出去，不能去任何地方。

57
Usually you can go to school.
通常你可以上学。

58
Right, right.
对，对。

59
But you can't have fun is the meaning.
但你不能玩乐，这就是意思。

60
That's right.
没错。

61
So it's usually a fixed phrase.
所以这通常是一个固定短语。

62
You're grounded.
你被禁足了。

63
That means that you are punished.
这意味着你受到了惩罚。

64
You can't go out.
你不能出去。

65
But in this case, the mom specified saying you're grounded.
但在这种情况下，妈妈明确说你被禁足了。

66
So that means that he can't go out.
这意味着他不能出去。

67
But on top of that, she said no allowance and no TV for a week.
但除此之外，她还说一周内没有零花钱，也不能看电视。

68
Oh, man.
哦，天哪。

69
So allowance is the money that your parents give you to go out, like to go to the movies or something.
零花钱是父母给你出去用的钱，比如去看电影或其他事情。

70
And your parents might give this to you on a weekly basis.
你的父母可能每周给你这个。

71
So every Saturday you get five dollars or on a monthly basis.
所以每个星期六你得到五美元，或者每月给你。

72
Every month you get twenty dollars.
每个月你得到二十美元。

73
And when his mother says you're not going to have any allowance for a week, that means we're not going to give you any money this week.
当他妈妈说你一周内没有零花钱时，这意味着我们这一周不会给你任何钱。

74
That's right.
没错。

75
So that is an allowance.
所以这就是零花钱。

76
How much money you get per month or per week.
你每月或每周得到多少钱。

77
The key thing about allowance, though, is that it's not something you do for work.
但零花钱的关键是，它不是你为工作做的事情。

78
You don't work and receive allowance.
你不工作就能得到零花钱。

79
If you work, you have a salary.
如果你工作，你就有工资。

80
Allowance is something that you get for free from someone.
零花钱是你从某人那里免费得到的东西。

81
So you can get an allowance from your boss to eat, but you can also have an allowance for your parents to do fun things.
所以你可以从老板那里得到零花钱去吃东西，但你也可以从父母那里得到零花钱去做有趣的事情。

82
That's right.
没错。

83
So usually kids, obviously, they can't work, so they get an allowance from their parents, usually for fun things, like going to the movies and stuff.
所以通常孩子们显然不能工作，所以他们从父母那里得到零花钱，通常是为了有趣的事情，比如去看电影等等。

84
All right, now going back a little bit, let's take a look at two ways that the mom addressed or called her son, because obviously it's her son.
好的，现在回过头来，看看妈妈称呼她儿子的两种方式，因为显然这是她的儿子。

85
But when he got home, she said, get in this door, young man.
但当他回到家时，她说，进这个门，年轻人。

86
Okay, these are angry mom phrases.
好吧，这些是生气的妈妈用语。

87
When you're in trouble, your parents tend to use different words to talk to you.
当你惹麻烦时，父母往往会用不同的词与你交谈。

88
So this is a very popular one, young man.
所以这是一个非常流行的说法，年轻人。

89
So it's like saying, you should be mature, but you made a mistake.
所以这就像是在说，你应该成熟，但你犯了错误。

90
All right, so come inside right now, young man.
好吧，马上进来，年轻人。

91
Yeah, it's a way to kind of emphasize that you are also very angry.
是的，这是一种强调你也很生气的方式。

92
And also when he was trying to explain what happened, she said, I don't care.
而且当他试图解释发生了什么时，她说，我不在乎。

93
You're grounded for life, mister.
你被禁足了，先生。

94
You're grounded for life, mister.
你被禁足了，先生。

95
So these are both ways of talking to young boys.
所以这两种方式都是对年轻男孩的称呼。

96
Mr. is the opposite of miss.
先生是小姐的反义词。

97
But in the case of a young girl, you'd say, get in this door, young lady.
但如果是年轻女孩，你会说，进这个门，年轻女士。

98
And then you're grounded for life, missy.
然后你被禁足了，小姐。

99
Missy.
小姐。

100

是的，我想他们会说小姐。

101

所以小姐，先生，年轻人，年轻女士。

103
These are all ways of referring to people in kind of... It's weird.
这些都是指人的方式，有点……这很奇怪。

104
It's kind of like they're adults, but they're not.
这有点像他们是成年人，但又不是。

105
Yeah, that's right.
是的，没错。

106
That's like saying you're in trouble.
这就像说你有麻烦了。

107
Yeah.
是的。

109

现在让我们看看我们为你挑选的四个关键短语，来自流利构建器。

132
Fluency Builder.
流利构建器。

133
All right, so this first phrase is something that actually we hear when the young boy or the young man is giving his excuse for being late.
好吧，这第一个短语实际上是我们听到年轻男孩或年轻人解释他迟到的理由时说的。

134
He said, listen, I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before 10.
他说，听着，我告诉詹妮弗她必须在10点之前把我送回去。

135

136
So the phrasal verb there is to drop off.
所以这里的短语动词是“drop off”。

137
This means to leave someone somewhere.
这意味着把某人留在某个地方。

138
That's right.

So for example, Jennifer probably has a car and Jennifer was supposed to take this boy home.

141
So he said she was going to drop me off before 10 o'clock.

142
That means kind of leave him at his house.

这意味着她会很严格，不会让他轻易逃脱或不禁足他。

158
She really has to be strict and she has to punish him.
她真的必须严格，并且必须惩罚他。

159
Okay, so to put your foot down or I put my foot down, this means to be strict with someone, to not maybe bend the rules or be flexible.
好吧，所以“put your foot down”或“我坚持立场”，这意味着对某人严格，不可能弯曲规则或灵活。

160

And now obviously he was very surprised that he's going to be grounded for so long and only for being a couple of hours late.

179
No way.

180
That's too serious.
