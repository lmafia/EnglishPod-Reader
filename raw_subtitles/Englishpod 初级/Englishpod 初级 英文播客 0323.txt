You know, we have taken a look at previous lessons where you can buy a ticket, how to book a flight, what to do at the airport.
我们之前讨论过如何购票、如何预订航班、在机场该做什么。

7
But now we are going to see what we can do if our flight gets canceled.

8
Okay, this is not a fun situation, but hopefully with our help you'll be able to understand what these messages are about flights that are canceled or delayed.

17
We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this.
我们对可能造成的任何不便表示歉意。

18
If your flight is urgent, I could put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening, but it's on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee you'll be able to take that flight.
如果您的航班很紧急，我可以把您放在今晚其他航班的候补名单上，但这是先到先得，所以不能保证您能搭乘该航班。

19
What are my other options?
我还有什么其他选择？

20
Well, if you can wait until tomorrow, we will put you up in a hotel for today, and you can take the scheduled flight for tomorrow morning.
如果您能等到明天，我们今天会为您安排酒店，您可以搭乘明天早上的航班。

21
That's fine.

22
I'll do that then.
那我就这样做。

23
Thank you for your understanding, sir.

24
I'll book your flight now.

25
All right, we're back, so now it's time for us to go into language takeaway.
好的，我们回来了，现在是我们进行语言要点的时间。

26
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

27
All right, in language takeaway today, we have about four words or phrases.
好的，今天的语言要点有大约四个单词或短语。

28
The first one is the reason for this cancellation.
第一个是取消的原因。

29
The reason is mechanical problems.
原因是机械问题。

30
That's right.
没错。

31
She said that the airplane has some mechanical problems, and that's why the flight is canceled.
她说飞机有一些机械问题，这就是航班被取消的原因。

32
So the key here is mechanical.
所以这里的关键是机械。

33
Mechanical meaning like related to machines, right?
机械的意思是与机器相关，对吧？

34
All right, so something that's a mechanical problem has to do with the actual structure of the plane.
没错，所以机械问题与飞机的实际结构有关。

35
That's right, so for example, maybe something is wrong with the wings, or maybe something is wrong with the engines, some type of problem that has to do with the mechanics of the machine.
没错，比如说，可能机翼有问题，或者引擎有问题，某种与机器的机械有关的问题。

36
Right, and obviously, if you have a problem with the wings or the wheels or the engine, you don't want to fly that plane.
对，显然，如果机翼、轮子或引擎有问题，你不想搭乘那架飞机。

37
That's right.
没错。

38
So this caused the canceled flight.
所以这导致了航班的取消。

39
Now, after that, we heard this word.
之后，我们听到了这个词。

40
We apologize for any inconveniences.
我们对可能造成的任何不便表示歉意。

41
What's an inconvenience, Marco?
不便是什么，Marco？

42
That's right.
没错。

43
Well, obviously, I planned to take this flight, let's say, Tuesday at 8 A.M.
嗯，显然，我计划在星期二早上8点搭乘这个航班。

44
And if the flight is canceled, that means I have to wait an hour or three hours or maybe for the next day, so it's an inconvenience.
如果航班被取消，那就意味着我得等一个小时、三个小时，或者可能等到明天，所以这就是不便。

45
It means it's not convenient for me.
这意味着对我来说不方便。

46
It causes me some trouble.
这给我带来了一些麻烦。

47
All right, so something that is inconvenient causes problems or causes trouble.
好吧，所以不方便的事情会造成问题或麻烦。

48
That's right.
没错。

49
For example, you have this late flight or canceled flight.
例如，你有这个延误的航班或被取消的航班。

50
That's an inconvenience, but also small things can be inconvenient as well, like I want to go home at 5.
这就是不便，但小事情也可能不方便，比如我想在5点回家。

51
Unfortunately, I have to write this report.
不幸的是，我得写这个报告。

52
It's very inconvenient.
这非常不方便。

53
That's right.
没错。

54
So maybe you have a doctor's appointment tomorrow at 12, but you also have a meeting at your work, so it's inconvenient, these two dates.
所以也许你明天中午12点有个医生预约，但你在工作时也有个会议，所以这两个时间都不方便。

55
All right, they cause problems for each other.
好吧，它们互相造成了问题。

56
So after that, the service person says, if your flight is urgent, I can put you on a waiting list.
然后，服务人员说，如果您的航班很紧急，我可以把您放在候补名单上。

57
Waiting list.
候补名单。

58
So this is another important phrase to understand when we're talking about canceled flights.
所以这是另一个在谈论航班取消时需要理解的重要短语。

59
That's right.
没错。

60
We usually get put on a waiting list, and it's basically a list with everyone's names where you are waiting for the next available flight or you are waiting to be able to have the service provided.
我们通常会被放在候补名单上，这基本上是一个包含每个人名字的名单，您在等待下一个可用航班或等待能够提供服务。

61
All right, so you can have a waiting list at an airport like here, but you can also have a waiting list at a restaurant, right?
好吧，所以在机场你可以有候补名单，但在餐厅也可以有候补名单，对吧？

62
That's right, and some restaurants are super popular, and you've got to get on a waiting list.
没错，一些餐厅非常受欢迎，你必须上候补名单。

63
So can I put my name on the waiting list?
那我可以把我的名字放在候补名单上吗？

64
That means, can you call me when there's a free table?
这意味着，当有空桌子时可以给我打电话吗？

65
Right, exactly.
对，正是如此。

66
So even though we are on this waiting list, it doesn't mean that we are guaranteed to be able to take this flight this evening.
所以即使我们在这个候补名单上，也并不意味着我们能保证今晚能搭乘这个航班。

67
So there is no guarantee.
所以没有保证。

68
All right, this guarantee, this is an important thing to talk about, because a guarantee is something that means that we will definitely get a later flight.
好吧，这个保证，这是一个重要的事情，因为保证意味着我们一定会得到一个后续航班。

69
Yeah, we promise.
是的，我们承诺。

70
We promise.
我们承诺。

71
So you often see the word guarantee in advertisements.
所以你经常在广告中看到“保证”这个词。

72
For example, this TV has a six-month guarantee, so we guarantee it won't break.
例如，这台电视有六个月的保证，所以我们保证它不会坏。

73
If it does, we will fix it.
如果坏了，我们会修理它。

74
That's right.
没错。

75
But no guarantee means that we can't promise.
但没有保证意味着我们不能承诺。

76
We don't promise.
我们不承诺。

77
That's right.
没错。

78
So it's possible that you won't get a flight.
所以你可能得不到航班。

79
So for example, if you buy a new car, the manufacturer will guarantee that it's in good condition and it won't break down.
例如，如果你买了一辆新车，制造商会保证它处于良好状态，不会抛锚。

80
But if you buy a used car, it's unlikely that they will give you that same guarantee.
但如果你买了一辆二手车，他们不太可能给你同样的保证。

81
No, that's right.
不，没错。

82
They cannot promise it because they don't know.
他们不能承诺，因为他们不知道。

83
Exactly.
正是如此。

84
All right, so a lot of words and phrases there.
好吧，这里有很多单词和短语。

85
Why don't we go back and listen to our dialogue again?
我们再回去听一遍对话吧。

86

94
If your flight is urgent, I could put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening.
如果您的航班很紧急，我可以把您放在今晚其他航班的候补名单上。

95
But it's on a first come, first serve basis.
但这是先到先得。

96
So there's no guarantee you'll be able to take that flight.
所以不能保证您能搭乘该航班。

97
What are my other options?
我还有什么其他选择？

98
Well, if you can wait until tomorrow, we will put you up in a hotel for today and you can take the scheduled flight for tomorrow morning.
如果您能等到明天，我们今天会为您安排酒店，您可以搭乘明天早上的航班。

99
That's fine.
好的。

100
I'll do that then.
那我就这样做。

101
Thank you for your understanding, sir.
谢谢你的理解，先生。

102
I'll book your flight now.
我现在就为你预订航班。

103
All right, so now let's take a look at three key phrases that we have prepared for you on Fluency Builder.
好的，现在让我们看看我们为你准备的流利表达中的三个关键短语。

104
Okay, so the first phrase we have here is a very important one.
好的，第一个短语是一个非常重要的短语。

105
This tells us about the cause of the problem.

106
The service person said, I'm sorry, sir.
服务人员说，抱歉，先生。

107
This flight has been canceled due to some mechanical problems.
这班航班因机械故障被取消。

108
So this phrase, due to, basically is saying because of, right?

109
That's right.
没错。

110
So this flight has been canceled because of mechanical problems.
所以这班航班因机械故障被取消。

111
And remember, this due is D-U-E.
记住，这个due是D-U-E。

112
That's right, D-U-E.
没错，D-U-E。

113
So I think it's kind of a nicer or more formal way of saying because of, or the reason is.
我觉得这是一种更优雅或更正式的说法，表示因为，或者原因是。

114
Exactly.
正是如此。

115
For example, the picnic has been canceled due to bad weather.
例如，野餐因恶劣天气被取消。

116
So it sounds a lot more professional, a lot more formal than if you say because of bad weather.
所以听起来比说因为恶劣天气要专业得多，更正式。

117
All right, so just remember here, due to indicates the cause or the reason.
好的，所以请记住，due to表示原因或理由。

118
It's like saying because.
就像说因为。

119
All right, now, when we were talking about the flights, we said that we are on the waiting list, but in order to catch this flight, they are going to take people on a first-come, first-served basis.
好的，现在，当我们谈论航班时，我们说我们在等待名单上，但为了赶上这班航班，他们将按先到先得的原则接人。

120
All right, first-come, first-served.
好的，先到先得。

121
Now, this is, again, a very common phrase.
这是一个非常常见的短语。

122
It's related to that waiting list thing we were talking about.
它与我们谈论的等待名单有关。

123
If you have a waiting list, usually the waiting list is first-come, first-served.
如果你有等待名单，通常等待名单是先到先得。

124
So I could say, you know, am I guaranteed a spot?
所以我可以说，你知道，我有保证能占到一个名额吗？

125
And you could say, well... It's first-come, first-served.
你可以说，嗯……这是先到先得。

126
Maybe, maybe not.
也许可以，也许不行。

127
If I'm number one on the list, I will probably get a seat.
如果我在名单上是第一，我可能会有座位。

128
But if I'm number 30, I might not.
但如果我是第30，我可能就没有。

129
Probably not.
可能没有。

130
So what we mean by it is that we don't give priority to anyone.
所以我们所说的意思是我们不优先考虑任何人。

131
We don't say, oh, you are more important or you're not.
我们不说，哦，你更重要，或者你不重要。

132
Whoever comes first gets it.
谁先来就先得。

133
All right, so if I come to the restaurant at 5 o'clock, I get to sit first.
好的，所以如果我5点到餐厅，我就可以先坐。

134
But if you come at 5.10, you're next.
但如果你5点10到，你就是下一个。

135
And after you, 5.30.
然后是5点30。

136
So it's first-come, first-served.
所以这是先到先得。

137
It depends on when you arrive.
这取决于你什么时候到。

138
That's right.
没错。

139

所以显然，这对我们来说并不方便。

140
So we are going to wait until tomorrow.
所以我们将等到明天。

141
But the airline will put us up in a hotel.
但航空公司会为我们安排酒店。

142
We will put you up in a hotel.
我们会为你安排酒店。

143
All right, so let's take this as a phrase.

144
Because we all know what a hotel is.

145
It's a place where you stay when you're on holiday or business.

229
So I can understand both sides.
