72
All right, we could say my computer has amazing graphics.
好吧，我们可以说我的电脑有惊人的图形。

73
It means games are really fun because they look good.

74
Mm-hmm, or this game has amazing graphics, so the game has, you know, places or scenery that looks really, really real.
嗯，或者这个游戏有惊人的图形，所以这个游戏有非常真实的场景或风景。

75
Right, so graphics, but some kinds of TVs are made to provide those wonderful graphics, and those are called HDTV.

76
Right, an HDTV, or that's an acronym for high-definition television.
对，HDTV，或者说是高清电视的缩写。

77
All right, and I heard some actors and actresses were complaining about HDTV because the picture quality is so good that you can see all of the little problems on their face, the little wrinkles and the pimples and the scars, so be careful because one day we're gonna be able to see way too much.
好吧，我听说一些演员和女演员抱怨HDTV，因为画质太好，以至于你可以看到他们脸上的所有小问题，小皱纹和痘痘，所以要小心，因为有一天我们会看到太多。

78
Exactly, so on high-definition television, that's basically what you get is better definition, better level of graphics.
正是如此，在高清电视上，你得到的基本上是更好的清晰度，更好的图形水平。

79
So more pixels per inch, you can see a lot more clarity.
所以每英寸更多的像素，你可以看到更多的清晰度。

80
Right, so an HDTV.
对，所以HDTV。

81
The next thing we're talking about is actually kind of related to the back part of your TV where you plug things in.
接下来我们要谈的是实际上与电视后面插入东西的部分有关。

82
Sometimes it's on the side, sometimes on the back.
有时在侧面，有时在后面。

83
Well, there are different names for different kinds of plugs, so today we're going to talk about two of those.

One of them is USB.
其中一个是USB。

85
Right, this TV has a USB port, which basically stands for Universal Serial Bus.
对，这台电视有一个USB端口，基本上代表通用串行总线。

86
All right, so port is a place where you plug something in.
好吧，端口是插入某物的地方。

87
Your computer has a lot of ports as well, but USB is maybe more common for people who have iPods or computers, because this is how we normally connect things to our computers.
你的电脑也有很多端口，但USB可能对拥有iPod或电脑的人更常见，因为这就是我们通常将东西连接到电脑的方式。

88
So in this case, this television, you could connect maybe your iPod and reproduce videos or pictures onto the TV.
所以在这种情况下，这台电视，你可以连接你的iPod并在电视上播放视频或图片。

89
Awesome, or in the second case, we have a DVI port, so DVI.
太棒了，或者在第二种情况下，我们有一个DVI端口，所以DVI。

90
You're gonna have to tell me about this one, Marco, because I'm not so sure.
你得告诉我这个，Marco，因为我不太确定。

91
Well, a DVI is basically a digital video input, so basically you can connect your computer to the TV and see what's on your screen.
好吧，DVI基本上是数字视频输入，所以你可以将电脑连接到电视，看到屏幕上的内容。

92
Nice, and so if you have a bunch of movies stored on your computer, you can just plug it into the TV and watch.

Basically, you know how before you used to get your DVD player, your VHS, and you had three cables, two for sound and one for video?
基本上，你知道以前你用DVD播放器、VHS时，有三根电缆，两根用于声音，一根用于视频吗？

99
Yeah, the red, yellow, and white cables.
是的，红色、黄色和白色的电缆。

100
Exactly.
正是如此。

101
So with this new type of cable or technology, with one cable, it takes all the information to the TV, so just one cable for everything.
所以用这种新类型的线或技术，一根线就能把所有信息传输到电视上，所有功能只需一根线。

102
Oh, nice, because my problem is I always used to put the wrong cable in the wrong port, so I'd have the red cable in the yellow port, and then I'd say, where's the video?
哦，太好了，因为我的问题是我总是把错误的线插到错误的端口，所以我会把红线插到黄端口，然后我会问，视频在哪里？

103
I can't see, all I can do is listen.
我看不见，我只能听。

104
Yeah, it happens.
是的，确实会发生。

105
So with this, now it's easy, and well, it even, it's a little bit more organized, because I remember I used to have a TV, and I had a lot of different things connected to it.
所以现在很简单，而且更有条理，因为我记得我以前有一台电视，连接了很多不同的东西。

106
It was just this big spider web in the back with all these cables.
后面就像一张大蜘蛛网，满是线。

107
So an HDMI high-definition multimedia interface connector.
所以这是一个HDMI高清多媒体接口连接器。

108
And what else do we have?

109
The last thing we're talking about is actually the place to put your TV.
我们最后要谈的是放置电视的地方。

110
So a lot of people now are putting their TVs on walls, like paintings, because these TVs are so thin.
现在很多人把电视挂在墙上，就像画一样，因为这些电视非常薄。

111
So we call this a wall mount.
所以我们称之为壁挂。

所以“挂”，挂东西也是一个动词，对吧？

113
Yeah, it means to put something up, or to hang something up.
是的，意思是把东西放上去，或者挂起来。

But the phrase here is the works.

150
All right, that means any option he could get, any possibility, he wants it all.

166
That means you have to plug things together.

But he's speaking in a very colloquial way, very familiar.
但他说得很口语化，非常熟悉。

183
It's a lot more native like.

184
Exactly.
