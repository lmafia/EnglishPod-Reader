27
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at some language takeaway.
好的，我们回来了，现在让我们看看一些语言要点。

28
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

29
All right, in the first sentence we are asking someone to help me set up my voicemail message.
好的，在第一句中，我们在请人帮我设置语音邮件。

30
So we got two key words there.
所以我们有两个关键词。

31
That's right, so let's break it up.
没错，让我们分开来看。

32
The first one is a phrasal verb, to set up.
第一个是短语动词，设置。

33
Okay, you can set a lot of things up, but just remember that set and up, these are the two words that go together.
好的，你可以设置很多东西，但请记住，set和up是两个连在一起的词。

34
In this case, we're setting up voicemail.
在这种情况下，我们是在设置语音邮件。

35
It means to establish, or to start, or to put together.
意思是建立、开始或组合。

36
Yeah, to install.
是的，安装。

37
Like for example, you get a new computer, and you have to connect all the cables, and you have to connect the monitor.
比如说，你买了一台新电脑，你需要连接所有的电缆，还要连接显示器。

38
So you said, can you help me set up my computer?
所以你说，能帮我设置我的电脑吗？

39
That's right.

40
So he always helps me set it up.

That's right.
没错。

43
And what we're setting up is our voicemail message.
我们要设置的是我们的语音邮件。

44
So what exactly is voicemail?
那么语音邮件到底是什么？

45
Well, you know what mail is.
嗯，你知道邮件是什么。

46
We have email, and regular mail.
我们有电子邮件和普通邮件。

47
Voicemail is the kind of message you receive on your phone, your cell phone, or your home phone, when you don't answer the phone.
语音邮件是你在手机或座机上收到的消息，当你没有接听电话时。

48
That's right.
没错。

49
So basically, a way for people to leave you a message, even though you can't answer them.
所以基本上，这是人们在你无法接听时留给你的信息方式。

50
That's right.
没错。

51
So this is something that's, it's not text, it's actually a voice.
所以这不是文本，而是声音。

52
That's why it's called voicemail.
这就是为什么它叫语音邮件。

53
And you have to set it up.
而且你必须设置它。

54
Okay, so there's, there's no automatic voicemail message, you actually have to make your own, or you can choose one.
好的，所以没有自动的语音邮件，你实际上必须自己制作，或者选择一个。

55
And today we're making our own.
今天我们要制作自己的。

56
That's right.
没错。

57
And so we're explaining that we actually just got this service.
所以我们在解释我们刚刚开通了这个服务。

58
And we don't really know what we're supposed to say or how to set up our voicemail.
我们不太确定该说什么或如何设置我们的语音邮件。

59
That's right.
没错。

60
So voicemail messages are kind of service.
所以语音邮件消息是一种服务。

61
And now who would offer this kind of service Marco?
那么Marco，谁会提供这种服务？

62
Probably your telephone company.
可能是你的电话公司。

63
That's right.
没错。

64
So a telephone company will offer many different services.
所以电话公司会提供许多不同的服务。

65
And these are things that you can pay extra for.
这些是你可以额外付费的东西。

66
And they're useful, they can help you in some way.

67
So another kind of service is three way calling.
另一种服务是三方通话。

68
Right?
对吧？

69
That's right.
没错。

70
So actually, we're taking a look at this word service as a noun.
所以实际上，我们在看这个词服务作为名词。

71
So we have a service or this service.
所以我们有一个服务或这项服务。

72
So the company offers this service.
所以公司提供这项服务。

73
And well, why are we setting up the voicemail and our friend explains that we just basically doing it to let the caller know who they called.
那么，为什么我们要设置语音邮件，我们的朋友解释说，我们基本上是为了让来电者知道他们拨打的是谁。

74
Okay, so if I call a number, and it says, Hey, leave a message.
好的，如果我拨打一个号码，它说，嘿，留个信息。

75
I don't know who I'm leaving a message for.
我不知道我在给谁留信息。

76
Did I dial the wrong number?
我拨错号码了吗？

77
Right?
对吧？

78
What do I say?
我该说什么？

79
Do I say my phone number?

80
So this is basically instructions for what to say.
所以这基本上是说话的指示。

81
That's right.
没错。

82
And you become the caller, right?
你变成了来电者，对吧？

83
So whoever is making the call is called the caller.
所以拨打电话的人被称为来电者。

84
And this is why we are setting up our voicemail to let the caller know who we are calling.
这就是我们设置语音邮件的原因，让来电者知道我们是谁。

85
And of course, we have to ask the caller for their contact information.
当然，我们必须询问来电者的联系信息。

86
I know this is important because it's not just something you have with voicemail messages.
我知道这很重要，因为这不仅仅是语音邮件消息中的内容。

87
You have contact information for many different things.
你有许多不同事物的联系信息。

88
For example, your medical care, your school, you have to include contact information.
例如，你的医疗保健、学校，你必须包含联系信息。

89
Now this would be your phone number, your address and or your email.
这将是你的电话号码、地址和/或电子邮件。

90
That's right.
没错。

91
So your contact information is not only useful for in a voicemail message.
所以你的联系信息不仅在语音邮件中有用。

92
But for example, in a business meeting or a business lunch, you want to get maybe someone else's contact information so you can call them later.
例如，在商务会议或商务午餐中，你可能想获取其他人的联系信息，以便稍后可以给他们打电话。

93
That's right.
没错。

94
So don't forget, it's also your name as well.
所以别忘了，这也是你的名字。

95
So I forgot to mention that.
我忘了提到这一点。

96
That's right.
没错。

97
Your contact information must have your name.
你的联系信息必须包含你的名字。

98
All right.
好的。

99
So that's pretty much all we have for the first part of language takeaway.
所以这就是我们语言要点的第一部分。

100
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.
我们再听一次对话，稍后我们会回来进行流利度训练。

So we've talked about, we've talked about how about many times already.

例如，你知道，咱们去看电影怎么样，或者说你周末怎么样？

131
Because that's completely wrong.

132
In this occasion, we're talking about how about this?
在这种情况下，我们说这样怎么样？

133
And this is like setting it up for an example.
这就像是为例子做铺垫。

134
That's right.
没错。

135
So for another example, we could say, so Marco, I'm trying to figure out how to say hello when I answer the phone because I don't like the way I say it So I can say, how about this?
所以另一个例子，我们可以说，马尔科，我在想我接电话时该怎么说你好，因为我不喜欢我说的方式，所以我可以说，这样怎么样？

136
Hello?
你好？

137
Is that good?
这样好吗？

138
No?

143
Hello?

对。

148
I'm saying, okay, keep listening.
我在说，好的，继续听。

149
I will give you an example.
我会给你一个例子。

150

So maybe you try on a black shirt and you say, how about this one?

152
Yeah, boring.

So then you're giving them other options and examples.

157
And this is why we say, how about this?

158
And then we give the example like Abby did.

159
And you're also asking for a response.

160
You're you're asking for an opinion.
你在询问意见。

161
And so what Abby is saying is, I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can.
所以艾比说的是，我保证会尽快给你回电。

162
Now this phrase give you a ring is very British English, but it's also something you should know if you want to be in America, because you'll hear it in TV and stuff.
现在这个短语给你回电在英式英语中很常见，但如果你想在美国生活，也应该知道，因为你会在电视等地方听到。

163
That's right.
没错。

164
It's actually a colloquial term for saying I will call you.
这实际上是一个口语表达，意思是我会打电话给你。

165
I will call you I will call you back or I will give you a call.
我会打电话给你，我会回电，或者我会给你打电话。

166
So the telephone rings.
所以电话响了。

167
That's the verb that goes with the phone, right?
这是与电话相关的动词，对吧？

168
Ring ring.
响响。

169
So I will give you a ring means I will call you just like you just said Marco.
所以我会给你回电意味着我会打电话给你，就像你刚才说的马尔科。

170
That's right.
没错。

171
So remember this phrase, it's actually it may seem a little bit confusing.
所以记住这个短语，实际上它可能看起来有点困惑。

172
But remember, it has to do with calling someone I will give you a ring is I will call you or if you say hey give me a ring later on this afternoon.
但记住，它与打电话有关，我会给你回电就是我会打电话给你，或者如果你说嘿，下午晚些时候给我打个电话。

173
It means call me later this afternoon.
这意味着下午晚些时候给我打电话。

174
All right, and then moving towards the end of the dialogue Abby says, hi you have reached Abby.
好的，然后在对话结束时，艾比说，嗨，你拨打的是艾比。

175
Okay, this is weird because she is Abby, but she's saying you have reached Abby.
好吧，这很奇怪，因为她是艾比，但她说你拨打的是艾比。

176
Right, you're speaking about yourself in the third person.
对，你在用第三人称谈论自己。

177
That's right.
没错。

178
So this is a message.
所以这是一个留言。

179
So you're telling people what to do.
所以你在告诉人们该怎么做。

180
Like I said they're instructions.
就像我说的那样，它们是指示。

181
And so this is basically the first thing you say.
所以这基本上是你说的第一句话。

182
You have reached Catherine.
你拨打的是凯瑟琳。

183
That means the number you dialed is Catherine's phone number.
这意味着你拨打的号码是凯瑟琳的电话号码。

184
Right.
对。

185
So you reached.
所以你拨打的是。

186
That means that you've contacted.
这意味着你已经联系了。

187
Right, exactly.
对，正是如此。

188
So as you said it's important if you ever call a bank or in or any type of company it will say you have reached Wells Fargo Bank or something and it'll give you it'll tell you what number you call because maybe you put in your finger wrong and you just call the wrong number.
所以正如你所说，如果你拨打银行或任何类型的公司，它会说你拨打的是富国银行或其他什么，并告诉你你拨打的号码，因为也许你输入错误，拨打了错误的号码。

189
That's right or you could use the word reached in a different way.
没错，或者你可以用不同的方式使用“拨打”这个词。

190
For example, yesterday I was very angry at Marco because I couldn't reach him by phone.
例如，昨天我非常生气，因为我无法通过电话联系到马尔科。

191
I called and called and called and couldn't reach him.
我拨了又拨，还是联系不上他。

192
And I realized then his phone is broken.
然后我意识到他的电话坏了。

193
That's right.
没错。

194
So actually this verb to reach someone also has to do with in general with calling.
所以实际上，这个动词“联系某人”也与打电话有关。

195
I was trying to reach you all afternoon but I couldn't get a hold of you.
我整个下午都在试图联系你，但我联系不上你。

196
That's right and I was so frustrated.
没错，我感到非常沮丧。

197
Well actually if I had voicemail I would continue by saying I am unable to answer your call right now because maybe my phone is off maybe I am busy so we say I am unable to answer your call right now.
其实如果我有语音信箱，我会继续说我现在无法接听你的电话，因为可能我的手机关机了，或者我很忙，所以我们说我现在无法接听你的电话。

198
Alright now this seems really long okay and a little bit strange but this is basically the the standard for how to record a message.
好吧，这听起来真的很长，有点奇怪，但这基本上是录制信息的标准。

199
I'm unable to answer your call right now.
我现在无法接听你的电话。

200
So you answer the phone right or you answer a phone call but in this case I'm unable to.
所以你接电话，对吧？或者你接听电话，但在这种情况下我无法接听。

201
That means I can't talk to you.
这意味着我不能和你说话。

202
Right.
对。

203
For whatever reason I'm out of the house I'm busy so I'm unable to answer your call right now just remember that that means I can't talk to you right now can't be on the phone.
无论出于什么原因，我不在家，我很忙，所以我现在无法接听你的电话，只要记住这意味着我现在不能和你说话，不能在电话上。

204
And actually this word unable sounds a lot more polite and a lot more formal than saying I can't.
而且实际上，这个词“无法”听起来比说“我不能”更礼貌和正式。

205
That's right and that's why we use it on messages like this because it is so polite and so nice.
没错，这就是我们在这样的信息中使用它的原因，因为它非常礼貌和友好。

206
That's right.
没错。

207
All right so that's all the time we have for Fluency Builder.
好吧，这就是我们在流利构建中所有的时间。

208
Let's take a listen to our dialogue one last time.
让我们最后再听一遍我们的对话。

209
Can you help me set up my voicemail message?
你能帮我设置我的语音信箱信息吗？

210
I just got this service and I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say.
我刚刚获得这个服务，我不太确定我应该说什么。

211
Sure you just basically got to let the caller know who they called and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back.
当然，你基本上只需要让来电者知道他们拨打的是谁，并询问他们的联系信息，以便你可以回拨。

212
Okay so I can say this is Abby's voicemail I will call you later so leave me your name and number.
好的，所以我可以说这是艾比的语音信箱，我会稍后给你打电话，所以请留下你的名字和号码。

213
That's more or less the idea but try something that sounds more friendly.
这大致是想法，但试试听起来更友好的说法。

214
Okay so how about this this is Abby and I'm really happy you called.
好的，那这样说怎么样，这是艾比，我很高兴你打电话来了。

215
I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can so please leave me your name and number.
我保证我会尽快给你回电，所以请留下你的名字和号码。

216
Talk to you soon.
很快再聊。

217
A little too friendly Abby.
有点太友好了，艾比。

218
Just say this.
就这样说。

219
Hi you've reached Abby.
嗨，你拨打的是艾比。

220
I'm unable to answer your call right now but if you leave me your name and phone number I will get back to you as soon as possible.
我现在无法接听你的电话，但如果你留下你的名字和电话号码，我会尽快回电。

221
Thanks.
谢谢。

222
That's perfect.
完美。

223
Can you say that again and record it for me?
你能再说一遍并为我录音吗？

224
All right so talking about voicemail I think in the United States this is a very very popular and almost necessary service.
好的，谈到语音信箱，我认为在美国这是一个非常流行且几乎必要的服务。

225
That's right so in America if you buy a phone plan which most people have that means that you you can use your phone in a certain way like every day you have free nights or you have a thousand minutes per month to talk but you sometimes also get these services or you pay extra for them and voicemail is very important because people don't text as much in America as they do in other countries and so I know in other places sometimes you text a message to someone and they receive it and okay it's
没错，所以在美国，如果你购买了手机套餐，大多数人都有，这意味着你可以以某种方式使用手机，比如每天有免费夜间通话，或者每月有一千分钟的通话时间，但有时你也会获得这些服务，或者为它们支付额外费用，而语音信箱非常重要，因为人们在美国发短信的频率没有其他国家那么高，所以我知道在其他地方，有时你给某人发短信，他们会收到，好的，这是

226
a it's a message but if you don't do that you actually have to record a message right like when I call my parents they never answer the phone so I always have to leave a voicemail message so I say hi it's Catherine it's Saturday where are you call me right okay so that's that's that
一条信息，但如果你不这样做，你实际上必须录制一条信息，对吧？就像我给我的父母打电话，他们从来不接电话，所以我总是得留一条语音信箱信息，我会说嗨，我是凯瑟琳，今天是星期六，你在哪里，给我打电话，对吧？所以这就是

227
kind of I think cultural behavior that we just expect to leave messages for people in America and it's actually interesting because I've been to other countries where they We also have voicemail messages and the service, but people are not as willing to actually leave the message.
一种我认为的文化行为，我们在美国就期待给人留信息，实际上很有趣，因为我去过其他国家，他们也有语音信箱和服务，但人们并不那么愿意留下信息。

228
So it happened to me.
所以这发生在我身上。

229
For example, I call someone, I get their voicemail, and I don't leave a message.
例如，我给某人打电话，接到他们的语音信箱，但我不留信息。

230
I just hang up.
我就挂了。

231
You're bored or you're uncomfortable?
你是无聊还是不舒服？

232
I don't know, because if you have a mobile phone, it'll show up anyways that you have a missed call from this person.
我不知道，因为如果你有手机，它会显示你有这个人的未接来电。

233
So then I don't really leave the message anymore.
所以我就不再留信息了。

234
It's like, okay, you saw that I called you.
就像，好吧，你看到我给你打电话了。

235
Either I'll just call you back later, or you'll call me back when you see the missed call.
要么我稍后再给你打电话，要么你看到未接来电时会给我回电。

236
But yeah, for homes, obviously it's different.
但对于家庭来说，显然是不同的。

237
You need to leave a message if you call someone.
如果你给某人打电话，你需要留一条信息。

238
Although sometimes it can be a bad thing.
虽然有时这可能是个坏事。

239
I definitely have a friend who loves to leave long messages.
我确实有一个朋友喜欢留长信息。

240
Oh really?
哦，真的？

241
Hey, Catherine, it's me.
嘿，凯瑟琳，是我。

242
So it's like Saturday at 4 o'clock, and I was just thinking about calling, and I was gonna come over, but I decided not to come over.
所以现在是星期六下午四点，我刚刚在想打电话，我本来打算过来，但我决定不来了。

243
But then I was thinking maybe I would just call you instead, and I can see that you're not home, but maybe you're out to dinner.
但我在想，也许我可以给你打电话，我看到你不在家，但也许你在外面吃晚餐。

244
I remember you sang, and they just go on and on and on.
我记得你唱过，他们就一直说下去。

245
Actually, there is an end.
其实是有个结尾的。

246
They'll go beep, and then it cuts you off.
他们会“嘟”，然后就切断你。

247
Right, I think it's like 30 seconds or something like this.
对，我想大约是30秒之类的。

248
So it's very interesting, this whole voicemail thing, especially in the business world as well.
所以这个语音信箱的事情非常有趣，尤其是在商业世界中。

249
Many times people go into a meeting, turn off their phones, or put it on silent, and if you want to reach them or you want to leave a message, you gotta do the voicemail thing.
很多时候，人们会进入会议，关闭手机，或者将其设置为静音，如果你想联系他们或留下信息，你就得使用语音信箱。

250
Yeah, calls will go right to voicemail so that you don't interrupt the meeting.
是的，电话会直接转到语音信箱，这样就不会打扰会议。

251
Exactly.
正是如此。

252
So that's all the time we have for today.
所以这就是我们今天所有的时间。
