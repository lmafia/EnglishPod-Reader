So basically, I'm feeling down.
所以基本上，我感到沮丧。

25
Okay, down.
好的，沮丧。

26
You might have heard this before because it's the opposite of the word up.
你可能以前听过这个，因为它是“高兴”的反义词。

27
So you're not feeling up happy looking up, you're feeling down.

I think you have... No, I'm seriously... Don't be grouchy, Catherine.
我觉得你...不，我是认真的...不要脾气暴躁，Catherine。

39
Geez.

40
No, so grouchy is a way someone acts, usually when they're in a bad mood.
不，所以脾气暴躁是一种人们的行为，通常是在他们心情不好时。

You know, like, give me an A, give me a B, or people cheering, or cheers when the beer.

258
You just want to go on and encourage me to find another boy.

261
Well, here we've got two friends who are using it, so it's a positive note, but she's kind of making fun of her saying, I can't believe you.
嗯，这里我们有两个朋友在使用它，所以是积极的，但她有点在开玩笑，意思是，我真不敢相信你。

262
