Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.
大家好，欢迎来到EnglishPod。

2
My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

3
My name is Catherine, and today we're tackling a very difficult issue for many English learners.
我叫Catherine，今天我们要讨论一个对许多英语学习者来说非常困难的问题。

4
We're talking about taking things from other people and giving them back.
我们在谈论从别人那里借东西并归还。

5
That's right.
没错。

6
So today we are going to talk about money, and we're going to lend money and borrow money, and we're going to talk more about this after we listen to the dialogue.
所以今天我们要谈论钱，我们要借钱和还钱，听完对话后我们会进一步讨论。

7
Can I borrow five bucks?
我可以借五块钱吗？

8
No.
不可以。

9
Come on, I'll pay you back on Tuesday.
拜托，我星期二会还你。

10
Last time I lent you money, you never paid me back.
上次我借你钱，你从未还我。

11
I promise, if you lend me five dollars today, I will repay you in full next week.
我保证，如果你今天借我五美元，我下周会全额还你。

12
Okay, but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral.
好吧，但我会把你的滑板车作为抵押。

13
Fine.
好吧。

14
I can't believe you don't trust me.
我真不敢相信你不信任我。

15
It's nothing personal, just business.
这不是个人问题，只是商业。

16
All right, so now let's take a look at that language on Language Takeaway.
好吧，现在让我们看看Language Takeaway上的语言。

17
So first up, we have the key verbs for today.
首先，我们有今天的关键动词。

18
The verb to borrow and to lend.
借和贷。

19
Now, this is a really important difference to make because many people make this mistake where they use the wrong verb.
这是一个非常重要的区别，因为很多人会犯这个错误，使用错误的动词。

20
Now, if I ask you, Marco, can I borrow your bicycle?
现在，如果我问你，Marco，我可以借你的自行车吗？

21
That means, can I take your bicycle from you?
这意味着，我可以从你那里拿走你的自行车吗？

22
And then later I'll give it back.
然后我会再还给你。

23
But I want to use it.
但我想使用它。

24
Right.
对。

25
So the verb is kind of reflexive.
所以这个动词有点反身。

26
It's going on to you.
它是指你。

27
So you want to borrow, right?
所以你想借，对吗？

28
I want to borrow.
我想借。

29
I want to take it from you for a short time and then I want to give it back.
我想短时间内从你那里拿走，然后再还给你。

30
So to borrow.
所以是借。

31
Right.
对。

32
Now the other verb is to lend.
另一个动词是贷。

33
And that, on the other hand, goes from me to you.
而那是从我到你。

34
So you borrow my bicycle.
所以你借我的自行车。

35
I lend you my bicycle.
我借给你我的自行车。

36
I give it to you.
我把它给你。

37
That's right.
没错。

38
So another way of asking, can I borrow, is can you lend me your bike?
所以问“我可以借吗”的另一种方式是“你可以借我你的自行车吗？”

39
That means, can you act?
这意味着，你能帮我这个忙吗？

40
Can you do this thing for me?
你能为我做这件事吗？

41
So there's two different ways of saying it.
所以有两种不同的说法。

42
And it's very important to remember who is doing what.
记住谁在做什么是非常重要的。

43
Exactly.
正确。

44
So remember, the person taking is borrowing.
所以记住，借的人是借。

45
The person giving is lending.
给的人是贷。

46
So it's not correct.
所以说“你能借我你的自行车吗”是不正确的。

47
And remember, and it's not correct to say, can you borrow me your bicycle?
这不对。

48
That's not right.
不，你能借我吗？

49
No, can you lend me?

50
Like, can you lend me a hand?
比如，你能借我一只手吗？

51
Can you help me?
你能帮我吗？

52
Right.
对。

53
So remember this.
所以记住这一点。

54
To borrow is something I do.
借是我做的事情。

55
I want to borrow from you.
我想向你借。

56
It's the person, the subject in a sentence.
这是句子的主语。

57
But in the case of lending, someone else is doing it.
但在贷的情况下，是别人做的。

58
So can you lend to me?
所以你能借给我吗？

59
Or can you lend it to him?
或者你能借给他吗？

60
You have to say who it's being lent to.
你必须说借给谁。

61
Exactly.
正确。

62
And as you said, who it's being lent to.
正如你所说，借给谁。

63
So the past tense of lend is lent.
所以贷的过去式是lent。

64
Yeah, so Marco lent me his bike last week and I broke it.
是的，Marco上周借了我他的自行车，我把它弄坏了。

65
So now I have to pay him a lot of money.
所以现在我得给他很多钱。

66
You have to pay me five bucks.
你得给我五块钱。

67
And that's our next word.
这就是我们的下一个词。

68
Bucks.
Bucks。

69
Now this is a slang term.
这是一个俚语。

70
So this is something we say very casually in America when we want to talk about dollars.
这是我们在美国非常随意地谈论美元时使用的。

71
Right.
对。

72
So one buck is one dollar.
所以一块钱是一美元。

73
A hundred bucks is a hundred dollars.
一百块是一百美元。

74
Alright.
好的。

75
Now as you said, it's very American.
正如你所说，这非常美国。

76
You wouldn't really use it like, I don't know if you're in Britain, you wouldn't say a hundred bucks.
如果你在英国，你不会说一百块。

77
No, you would say quid.
不，你会说quid。

78
Quid.
Quid。

79
Yeah, exactly.
是的，没错。

80
So they don't have dollars, so they don't say bucks.
所以他们没有美元，所以他们不说bucks。

81
Not in England.
在英国不是。

82
Alright, very good.
好的，非常好。

83
So we wanted to borrow five dollars.
所以我们想借五美元。

84
And that person promised to pay you back on Tuesday.
那个人承诺星期二还你。

85
I'll pay you back on Tuesday.
我星期二会还你。

86
Alright, so this is a lot like that verb to lend.
好的，这与贷这个动词非常相似。

87
To lend him, to pay you, you have to say who you're going to pay.
借给他，付给你，你必须说你要付给谁。

88
Right.
对。

89
So Marco, I'm sorry about your bicycle.
所以Marco，我为你的自行车感到抱歉。

90
I will pay you back tomorrow.
我明天会还你。

91
Okay.
好的。

92
That means I will give you money for it tomorrow.
这意味着我明天会给你钱。

93
So if you borrow money, you have to pay it back.
所以如果你借钱，你必须还。

94
Alright, so I want to borrow five dollars.
好的，我想借五美元。

95
I promise I will pay you back Thursday.
我保证我星期四会还你。

96
Very good.
非常好。

97
Okay.
好的。

98
And now lastly, we will lend money, but of course we need a guarantee.
最后，我们会借钱，但当然我们需要一个保证。

99
We need something to make sure that you will pay me back.
我们需要一些东西来确保你会还我。

100
So that's called collateral.
这被称为抵押品。

101
Alright, now collateral is important because sometimes you can't trust someone like you say, Marco.
好的，抵押物很重要，因为有时候你不能信任某人，就像你说的，Marco。

102
And so for example, if I want to rent a bicycle, so I want to use it for the day, maybe there's a store that they rent bicycles to people, I would give my passport or my driver's license as collateral because I will definitely return to take my driver's license or passport back.
例如，如果我想租一辆自行车，想用一天，也许有一家店租自行车给人，我会把我的护照或驾照作为抵押，因为我肯定会回来取回我的驾照或护照。

103
So that's basically a sign of a promise.
所以这基本上是一个承诺的标志。

104
Money or identification or some object.
钱或身份证明或某个物品。

105
That's right.
没错。

106
So usually, for example, if you're going to get a very big loan at the bank, they will ask you for something as collateral.
通常，例如，如果你要在银行获得一笔很大的贷款，他们会要求你提供一些抵押物。

107
So maybe you will have to give them your house as collateral.
所以也许你需要把你的房子作为抵押。

108
So you're saying if I can't pay you back, then you can take my house.
所以你是在说如果我不能还你钱，那么你可以拿我的房子。

109
That's right.
没错。

110
So collateral is the last word in language takeaway.
所以抵押物是语言学习中的最后一个词。

111
