50
Okay, so you're not sure if they broke up or no one has told you for a fact.

No, it means I probably heard it from someone else who heard it from someone else who heard it from someone else who doesn't really know.
不，这意味着我可能是从另一个人那里听来的，而那个人又是从另一个人那里听来的，最后一个人并不真正知道。

52
Right, so rumors are maybe guesses about people and you don't know if they're true.
