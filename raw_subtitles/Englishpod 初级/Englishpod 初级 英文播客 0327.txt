24
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at some vocab on Language Takeaway.
好的，我们回来了，现在来看看Language Takeaway的一些词汇。

25
Alright, so today on Language Takeaway, the first phrase we have is actually a verbal phrase.
好的，今天Language Takeaway的第一个短语实际上是一个动词短语。

26
This is what we do when we go to find some clothes.
这是我们去找衣服时所做的。

27
We try on those clothes.
我们试穿这些衣服。

28
That's right, so that is, as you said, a verbal phrase, and to try on a pair of pants or to try on some clothes is to put them on and see if they are okay, if they're the right size.
没错，正如你所说，这是一个动词短语，试穿一条裤子或一些衣服就是穿上它们，看看是否合适，尺码是否正确。

29
That's right, so if I'm in the store and I see a shirt that I really like, I go to the dressing room to try it on.
没错，如果我在商店看到一件我非常喜欢的衬衫，我会去试衣间试穿。

30
Or you could say, oh my gosh, Marco, come here, this shirt is great, you should try it on.
或者你可以说，哦我的天，Marco，过来，这件衬衫太好了，你应该试试。

31
That's right, so you try it on or you try on something.
没错，所以你试穿它或者试穿一些东西。

32
Alright, so as we said, we wanted to try on a pair of jeans.
好的，正如我们所说，我们想试穿一条牛仔裤。

33
So let's take a look at this connection of words.
那么让我们看看这个词组的连接。

34
Pair of jeans.
一条牛仔裤。

35
Alright, so you don't have a jeans, you have a pair of them.
好的，所以你没有一条牛仔裤，而是一对。

36
And this is because you have not one, but two legs.
这是因为你有两条腿，而不是一条。

37
So pair means two of something.
所以一对意味着两件东西。

38
That's right, so it doesn't mean that you have two pants, right?
没错，所以这并不意味着你有两条裤子，对吧？

39
It doesn't mean that you have two pieces of clothing.
这并不意味着你有两件衣服。

40
It means that you have one piece of clothing that's a pair of jeans.
这意味着你有一件衣服，是一条牛仔裤。

41
That's right, so you have one part for one leg and one part for another leg.
没错，所以你有一部分是给一条腿的，另一部分是给另一条腿的。

42
The same is true of glasses, because glasses are for your two eyes.
眼镜也是如此，因为眼镜是给你两只眼睛的。

43
So you have a pair of glasses.
所以你有一副眼镜。

44
That's right, a pair of glasses, a pair of shoes.
没错，一副眼镜，一双鞋。

45
Also.
也是。

46
Okay, so we are trying on these pair of jeans, but they seem to be a bit too tight.
好的，我们正在试穿这条牛仔裤，但它们似乎有点紧。

47
Alright, so tight is a word we use when something is too small.
好的，紧是我们用来形容某物太小的一个词。

48
It's hard to move if something is too tight.
如果某物太紧，就很难移动。

49
So maybe if the pants are too small, they might be too tight.
所以如果裤子太小，它们可能会太紧。

50
Yeah, and we often say this, especially to girls, my mom used to say this, Oh no, you're not wearing that skirt, it's too tight.
是啊，我们常常这样说，尤其是对女孩，我妈妈以前常说，哦不，你不能穿那条裙子，它太紧了。

51
You can see your body underneath.
你能看到你身体的轮廓。

52
Okay, so actually the opposite would be loose if something is too big.
好的，实际上相反的情况是松，如果某物太大。

53
Too big, if it's too big it's loose, if it's too small it's tight.
太大，如果它太大就是松的，如果它太小就是紧的。

54
Okay, now if it's not too big and not too small, then that means it fits.
好的，现在如果它不太大也不太小，那就意味着它合适。

55
It fits, that's right.
合适，没错。

56
So I could say, I think I want to buy this pair of jeans, it fits very well.
所以我可以说，我想买这条牛仔裤，它非常合适。

57
So if the pants or the pair of jeans fit, it means they are okay for you.
所以如果裤子或牛仔裤合适，意味着它们对你来说是可以的。

58
They're not too big, not too small.
它们不太大，也不太小。

59
They're comfortable.
它们很舒适。

60
And in this case she said that they fit perfectly because they show off her curves.
在这种情况下，她说它们合适得完美，因为它们展现了她的曲线。

61
Now, what is she talking about, my curves?
现在，她在说什么，我的曲线？

62
Well, a curve is something that's not straight, it bends.
嗯，曲线是指不直的东西，它弯曲。

63
But when we're talking about a person's curves, we're talking about maybe a woman's hips, or her behind, her rear end, or her chest.
但当我们谈论一个人的曲线时，我们可能在谈论一个女人的臀部，或者她的后面，或者她的胸部。

64
And so women who have curves maybe are rounder, not flat.
所以有曲线的女性可能更圆润，而不是平坦。

65
Okay, so it's something that usually you would use with girls, right?
好的，这通常是你会用在女孩身上的，对吧？

66
A girl has nice curves.
一个女孩有漂亮的曲线。

67
You wouldn't really say that for a guy, I think.
我觉得你不会这样说一个男孩。

68
No, guys you don't really talk about curves.
不，男孩你不会谈论曲线。

69
But with girls, usually you can see someone's curves if she wears tight clothes.
但对于女孩来说，通常如果她穿着紧身衣服，你可以看到她的曲线。

70
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

Alright, so speaking about pants, I've noticed something that the girl asked for a size 4, but she really was a size 8.
好吧，谈到裤子，我注意到女孩要求4号，但她实际上是8号。

So how does this work?
这怎么回事？

Because as guys, we don't have size 4s, 5s or 1s or anything.

You buy a pair of jeans, you say size 32 in the waist and size 30 in length or something like this.
你买一条牛仔裤，你说腰围32，长度30或类似的。

152
So that's right.

153
Men's clothes usually indicate the size of your waist.

154
So 32 is a 32-inch waist.

155
But women's clothes don't have those measurements.

156
And I sometimes think it would be better if we did.

Some stores have size 4, which is one size, but if you go to another store, it's very different.
一些商店有4号，这是一种尺寸，但如果你去另一家商店，可能会很不同。

159
So you always have to try on these clothes.

160
But normally in America, the sizes go from 0, which is the very, very smallest, to 14 or 16, which is the largest.
但通常在美国，尺寸从0开始，0是最小的，到14或16，是最大的。

161
A normal size for most women would be an 8, I think.
大多数女性的正常尺寸我认为是8。

162
An 8 or a 10.
8或10。

163
And now obviously this depends on the countries.
现在显然这取决于国家。

164
Because for example, being in Asia, in China, women are usually a little bit thinner or smaller.
因为例如，在亚洲，在中国，女性通常稍微瘦一点或小一点。

165
So it's harder, I think, for... it's harder to actually have this universal form of measurements for girls.
所以我认为，对于女孩来说，实际上很难有这种通用的尺寸标准。

166
That's right.
没错。

167
So in the back of your pants, for example, there'll usually be some fabric.
所以在你的裤子后面，通常会有一些面料。

168
And it will say the size according to different countries.

169
So in America, size 6.

172
And UK is also a different size.
英国的尺寸也不同。

173
Kind of like your shoes.

英国的尺寸，比如41、42。

176
And the USA size, which is like size 8 or 9.
和美国的尺寸，比如8或9号。

177
So it's very, very interesting.
所以这非常有趣。

178
Especially when you're buying clothes, you have to remember what size you are and you have to ask the person that you try it on.
尤其是当你买衣服时，你必须记住你是什么尺寸，并且你必须问试穿的人。

179
Because some things I know you can't try on, right?
因为有些东西我知道你不能试穿，对吧？

180
That's right.
没错。

181
And in some stores, you have to ask for help to take things off the racks.
在一些商店，你必须请求帮助才能从架子上拿东西。

182
So it can be very difficult.
所以这可能非常困难。

183
But normally, if you say, hey, can I try this on, the shopkeeper will help you.
