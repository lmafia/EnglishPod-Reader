That's right.
没错。

Today we're trying to find a university.
今天我们要找一所大学。

6
We want to get some information about how much it costs and all that sort of stuff.
我们想了解一下费用和其他相关信息。

7
So why don't we jump into the dialogue and see what's going on today.
那我们为什么不直接进入对话，看看今天发生了什么。

8
I've never heard of M-Line College.
我从未听说过M-Line College。

9
Could you?
你能告诉我吗？

10
Of course, sir.
当然，先生。

11
Let me give you a brief overview.
让我给你一个简要概述。

12
M-Line College is located in the center of New York City.
M-Line College位于纽约市中心。

13
The school covers a wide range of academic subjects and 80% of the courses are transferable to other state universities.
这所学校涵盖了广泛的学科，80%的课程可以转学到其他州立大学。

14
And last year M-Line College was ranked number one in terms of graduate employment.
去年M-Line College在毕业生就业方面排名第一。

15
Interesting.
有趣。

16
And what about the tuition fees then?
那学费呢？

17
You'll be looking at somewhere around $15,000 USD per semester.
每学期大约需要15,000美元。

18
Okay... well... And did I mention our on-campus housing?
好吧……我提到过我们的校园住宿吗？

19
Students can stay in our newly renovated dorms for as little as $3,000 USD per month.
学生可以以每月3,000美元的价格住在我们新装修的宿舍里。

20
Sounds good!
听起来不错！

21
Well, I'll just grab one of your flyers.
好吧，我来拿一张你的宣传单。

22
Sir!
先生！

23
You got the wrong flyer!
你拿错宣传单了！

24
Sir!
先生！

25
Sir!
先生！

26
Alright, we're back.
好吧，我们回来了。

27
So now let's take a look at some language on Language Takeaway.
现在让我们看看Language Takeaway中的一些语言。

28
Language Takeaway So first up, Marco, we've got this word transferable.
Language Takeaway 首先，Marco，我们有这个词“可转学的”。

29
In the dialogue, the representative from M-Line College said that 80% of the courses are transferable to other universities.
在对话中，M-Line College的代表说80%的课程可以转学到其他大学。

30
Okay, so before we talk about transferable, what is the difference here?
好的，在我们讨论可转学之前，这里有什么区别？

31
We have two words, college and university.
我们有两个词，college和university。

32
So why is he saying that you can transfer your courses from M-Line College to another university?
那么他为什么说你可以把课程从M-Line College转到另一所大学呢？

33
Well, college and university are words that we use in English to describe higher education.
嗯，college和university是我们用来描述高等教育的英语词汇。

34
That means education after high school.
这意味着高中后的教育。

35
And a college is usually just for bachelor's students, students who are doing their first four years out of high school.
而college通常只针对学士学位的学生，即高中毕业后的前四年。

36
But a university is usually a larger institution that has bachelor's degree students as well as master's degree students and PhD candidates.
但university通常是一个更大的机构，既有学士学位的学生，也有硕士和博士候选人。

37
And so while a college is for 18-22 year olds, a university can have students of all ages who are doing sometimes very advanced degrees, like post-doctoral work.
所以，虽然college是针对18到22岁的人，university可以有各个年龄段的学生，有时还在攻读非常高级的学位，比如博士后工作。

38
Okay, very interesting.
好的，非常有趣。

39
And so this is why the person mentions that 80% of the courses are transferable to other state universities.
这就是为什么那个人提到80%的课程可以转学到其他州立大学。

40
So transferable means that you can transfer, you can move to another university.
所以可转学的意思是你可以转学，转到另一所大学。

41
So everything that you've studied, you can take with you.
所以你所学的一切都可以带走。

42
That's right.
没错。

43
So a lot of people like to start at a college or vice versa, like to start at a big university and transfer to a college.
所以很多人喜欢先在college学习，或者反之，先在大大学学习然后转到college。

44
And so it's important to know that your courses can be transferred as well.
所以知道你的课程也可以转学是很重要的。

45
So if I studied Spanish for two years, I can transfer those courses to my new school.
如果我学习了两年的西班牙语，我可以把这些课程转到我的新学校。

46
Right, so you don't have to start over.
对，所以你不必重新开始。

47
Right.
对。

48
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

49
And well, obviously one of the big questions when you're picking a university is the tuition fee.
而且，显然，选择大学时一个重要的问题是学费。

50
So tuition is the amount of money it costs to attend a university for usually a year.
所以学费是通常一年上大学的费用。

51
Tuition fees are the actual money you have to pay.
学费是你必须支付的实际金额。

52
So you can say, I can't afford my tuition fees this year, so I will be getting a part-time job.
所以你可以说，我今年负担不起学费，所以我会找一份兼职工作。

53
Okay, and so this is what tuition fees are.
好的，这就是学费的意思。

54
In school, you call it tuition.
在学校，你称之为学费。

55
You don't say how much it costs, you ask, what is the tuition?
你不说多少钱，你问，学费是多少？

56
What's the tuition exactly?
学费到底是多少？

57
Okay, and he mentioned that it was around $15,000 per semester.
好的，他提到每学期大约15,000美元。

58
So this is interesting.
这很有趣。

59
Is this the year?
这是每年吗？

60
No, a semester is half of an academic year.
不，学期是一个学年的一半。

61
Alright, so an academic year is usually September to May or June.
好吧，所以一个学年通常是从九月到五月或六月。

62
And a semester is half of that.
而学期是其中的一半。

63
So first semester or fall semester is the study period between September and December or January.
所以第一学期或秋季学期是从九月到十二月或一月的学习期。

64
That's right.
没错。

65
Okay, so basically what we could deduce is that this university costs $15,000 per semester or about $30,000 per year.
好的，所以基本上我们可以推断出这所大学每学期费用为15,000美元，或每年约30,000美元。

66
That's right.
没错。

67
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

68
And well, he also mentioned about the on-campus housing.
而且，他还提到了校园住宿。

69
Alright, so on-campus is pretty straightforward.
好吧，校园住宿很简单。

70
It means that this housing option where you live and sleep is on the campus.
这意味着你居住和睡觉的住宿选项在校园内。

71
And a university campus is not one building.
而大学校园不是一栋建筑。

72
It's many, many buildings together.
它是许多建筑的集合。

73
Sometimes there are classrooms and there are laboratories and there's a cafeteria, but there's also housing.
有时有教室、实验室和自助餐厅，但也有住宿。

74
And most housing comes in one style.
大多数住宿都是一种风格。

75
What's the style they mentioned in today's dialogue?
今天对话中提到的风格是什么？

76
A dorm.
宿舍。

77
This is where university students usually live if they live on campus.
这是大学生通常住的地方，如果他们住在校园里。

78
They have dorms.
他们有宿舍。

79
So dorm is short for dormitory.
所以宿舍是“宿舍”的缩写。

80
And it basically means that it's an apartment building for students or even sometimes workers.
基本上是一个学生或有时工人的公寓楼。

81
That's very close to where they'll be studying or working.
离他们学习或工作的地方非常近。

82
So what is the difference between a dorm and an apartment?
那么宿舍和公寓有什么区别？

83
Well, I can give you an example.
嗯，我可以给你一个例子。

84
Some dorms are very fancy, but my dorm at university was very simple.
有些宿舍非常豪华，但我在大学的宿舍非常简单。

85
So I lived in one bedroom with another girl.
我和另一个女孩住在一个卧室里。

86
There were two beds and no bathroom.
有两张床，没有浴室。

87
And so everyone on that floor of the building shared bathrooms.
所以那栋楼的每个人都共享浴室。

88
And the bathrooms were, you know, there's six showers and four toilets or whatever.
浴室里有六个淋浴和四个厕所。

89
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

90
Yeah, I think this is the main thing with a dorm is usually you don't have a kitchen.
是的，我认为宿舍的主要特点是通常没有厨房。

91
You don't have usually your own bathroom.
通常没有自己的浴室。

92
And so it's just basically a room and a bedroom.
所以基本上就是一个房间和一个卧室。

93
And then you share everything else with other people.
然后你和其他人共享其他所有东西。

94
Alright, very good.
好吧，非常好。

95
A lot of great things related to college.
许多与大学相关的好东西。

96
I think this is very good vocab for you, especially if you're considering going to college or something like that.
我认为这对你来说是非常好的词汇，特别是如果你考虑上大学或类似的事情。

97
Especially if you're considering going to college or maybe you want to continue your studies.
特别是如果你考虑上大学，或者你想继续学习。

98
So why don't we go back.
那我们为什么不回去呢？

99
Let's listen to this dialogue again.
让我们再听一遍这个对话。

100
And we'll be back with Fluency Builder.
我们将回到流利度提升环节。

101
I've never heard of M.
我从未听说过M.

102
Lyon College.
莱昂学院。

103
Could you?
你能吗？

104
Of course, sir.
当然，先生。

105
Let me give you a brief overview.
让我给你一个简要概述。

106
M.
M.

107
Lyon College is located in the center of New York City.
莱昂学院位于纽约市中心。

108
The school covers a wide range of academic subjects and 80% of the courses are transferable to other state universities.
这所学校涵盖了广泛的学术科目，80%的课程可以转学到其他州立大学。

109
And last year M.
去年M.

110
Lyon College was ranked number one in terms of graduate employment.
莱昂学院在毕业生就业方面排名第一。

111
Interesting.
有趣。

112
And what about the tuition fees then?
那学费呢？

113
You'll be looking at somewhere around $15,000 per semester.
你大约需要支付每学期$15,000。

114
Okay, well... And did I mention our on-campus housing?
好吧... 我提到过我们的校园住宿吗？

115
Students can stay in our newly renovated dorms for as little as $3,000 per month.
学生可以以每月$3,000的低价住在我们新装修的宿舍里。

116
Sounds good!
听起来不错！

117
Well, I'll just grab one of your flyers.
好吧，我就拿一张你的传单。

118
Sir, you got the wrong flyer!
先生，你拿错传单了！

119
Sir!
先生！

120
Sir!
先生！

121
All right, we're back.
好吧，我们回来了。

122
So now let's take a look at these three phrases we've picked out for you on Fluency Builder.
现在让我们看看我们为你挑选的这三句话，关于流利度提升。

123
Fluency Builder.
流利度提升。

124
So again, when the person who was speaking for this college was describing it, they said that the school covers a wide range of academic subjects.
再次，当为这所大学发言的人描述它时，他们说这所学校涵盖了广泛的学术科目。

125
Now this phrase, wide range, is something you'll hear in a lot of different contexts.
现在这个短语，广泛的范围，是你在很多不同的语境中会听到的。

126
What does it mean, Marco?
这是什么意思，马尔科？

127
That's right.
没错。

128
It means that they have a variety, a very big variety of subjects.
这意味着他们有多种多样的科目。

129
So they don't only focus, for example, on business.
所以他们不仅仅专注于商业。

130
They may have arts, they may have engineering, business, etc.
他们可能有艺术，可能有工程，商业等等。

131
So if you're studying at a university and they offer one course, they offer English, is that a wide range of subjects?
所以如果你在大学学习，他们只提供一门课程，提供英语，那算不算广泛的科目？

132
No, no, that's not a wide range.
不，不，这不算广泛。

133
So basically, a wide range of subjects would be that you can have many, many, many choices.
所以基本上，广泛的科目意味着你可以有很多很多的选择。

134
Well, after that, we also had a great phrase when we were discussing tuition fees.
好吧，之后我们在讨论学费时也有一个很好的短语。

135
So the visitor asked, what about the tuition fees?
所以访客问，学费呢？

136
And the answer was, you'll be looking at somewhere around $15,000.
答案是，你大约需要支付$15,000。

137
Now, you'll be looking at is a very, very strange phrase, right?
现在，你将要支付是一个非常奇怪的短语，对吧？

138
Well, it's not strange, but it might sound strange to non-native English speakers.
嗯，这并不奇怪，但对非母语英语者来说可能听起来奇怪。

139
Right.
对。

140
It's actually a very common phrase, especially when you're talking to salesmen.
这实际上是一个非常常见的短语，特别是在你和销售人员交谈时。

141
They don't want to say, you'll have to pay, or you have to pay, or anything like this.
他们不想说，你必须支付，或者你要支付，或者类似的事情。

142
They'll say, well, you'll be looking at somewhere around $15,000.
他们会说，嗯，你大约需要支付$15,000。

143
And that means you are expected to pay this amount of money.
这意味着你预计要支付这个金额。

144
But they don't really say pay, so this is the key thing.
但他们并没有真正说支付，所以这是关键。

145
All right, so this is the price.
好吧，这就是价格。

146
This is the price tag.
这是价格标签。

147
And this is something that, like you're saying, salespeople say so that you don't have to say, well, the price of this is $30,000.
这就像你说的，销售人员会这样说，以免说，嗯，这个价格是$30,000。

148
So another good context for this phrase would be like a car dealership.
所以这个短语的另一个好语境可能是汽车经销商。

149
If I'm buying a car, and I see a beautiful new Ford Mustang, and I say, well, how much does this cost?
如果我买一辆车，看到一辆漂亮的新福特野马，我问，嗯，这个多少钱？

150
What would you, as the car dealer, say?
作为汽车经销商的你会怎么说？

151
I'll say, well, you'll be looking at around $30,000.
我会说，嗯，你大约需要支付$30,000。

152
I don't know.
我不知道。

153
That's right.
没错。

154
So this is a way of saying you'll have to pay.
所以这是一种说你必须支付的方式。

155
And, well, the guy wasn't really convinced.
而且，嗯，那个人并没有真的被说服。

156
I think it was kind of expensive because dorms were also $3,000 per month.
我觉得这有点贵，因为宿舍也是每月$3,000。

157
So he was like, well, sounds good.
所以他就说，嗯，听起来不错。

158
Well, I'll just grab one of your flyers.
好吧，我就拿一张你的传单。

159
All right, so this phrase, sounds good, is something that English speakers use all the time.
好吧，这个短语，听起来不错，是英语使用者经常使用的。

160
I personally use it very, very often.
我个人非常非常常用。

161
And it's another way of saying okay.
这也是另一种说“好的”的方式。

162
Yeah, so if you agree with someone, you say sounds good.
是的，如果你同意某人，你就说听起来不错。

163
So, should we meet at 7 for the movie tonight?
那么，我们今晚7点见面看电影好吗？

164
Yeah, sure, sounds good.
是的，当然，听起来不错。

165
All right.
好吧。

166
It's another way of saying yes, good, okay, very well.
这也是另一种说“是的，好，好的，非常好”的方式。

167
That's right.
没错。

168
So, sounds good.
所以，听起来不错。

169
Great stuff.
很棒的东西。

170
Why don't we take a break?
我们为什么不休息一下？

171
Let's listen to everything one more time, and we'll be back in a bit.
让我们再听一遍所有内容，我们稍后会回来。

172
I've never heard of M-Line College.
我从未听说过M-莱恩学院。

173
Could you?
你能吗？

174
Of course, sir.
当然，先生。

175
Let me give you a brief overview.
让我给你一个简要概述。

176
M-Line College is located in the center of New York City.
M-莱恩学院位于纽约市中心。

177
The school covers a wide range of academic subjects, and 80% of the courses are transferable to other state universities.
这所学校涵盖了广泛的学术科目，80%的课程可以转学到其他州立大学。

178
And last year, M-Line College was ranked number one in terms of graduate employment.
去年，M-莱恩学院在毕业生就业方面排名第一。

179
Interesting.
有趣。

180
And what about the tuition fees then?
那学费呢？

181
You'll be looking at somewhere around $15,000 per semester.
你大约需要支付每学期$15,000。

182
Okay, well... And did I mention our on-campus housing?
好吧... 我提到过我们的校园住宿吗？

183
Students can stay in our newly renovated dorms for as little as $3,000 per month.
学生可以以每月$3,000的低价住在我们新装修的宿舍里。

184
Sounds good!
听起来不错！

185
Well, I'll just grab one of your flyers.
好吧，我就拿一张你的传单。

186
Sir, you got the wrong flyer.
先生，你拿错传单了。

187
Sir!
先生！

188
Sir!
先生！

189
Alright, so universities in the United States, they have a very... they have a... they're infamous for being very expensive.
好吧，美国的大学，他们非常... 他们以非常昂贵而臭名昭著。

190
That's right, and so we discussed the difference between colleges and universities, but I think it's important to also talk about the difference between public and private schools.
没错，所以我们讨论了大学和学院之间的区别，但我认为也有必要谈谈公立学校和私立学校之间的区别。

191
Public schools are schools that are paid for by the government, or that are subsidized, so the government pays part of them.
公立学校是由政府支付或补贴的学校，因此政府支付部分费用。

192
And these are schools that tend to be cheaper than private schools.
这些学校通常比私立学校便宜。

193
So private schools can be as much as $50,000 for one year of study.
所以私立学校的学费可以高达$50,000一年。

194
So for example, the famous ones like Harvard or Stanford, those are private schools.
例如，像哈佛或斯坦福这样的著名学校，都是私立学校。

195
Those are private schools, but the University of California is a public institution.
这些是私立学校，但加州大学是公立机构。

196
The University of Illinois, for example, is another public institution, so there are many different options in the United States.
例如，伊利诺伊大学也是另一所公立机构，因此在美国有很多不同的选择。

197
I think usually the state universities have the name of the state in them, so University of Florida is probably State University.
我认为通常州立大学的名称中会包含州名，所以佛罗里达大学可能是州立大学。

198
That's right, but you have to be careful, because the University of Pennsylvania is a private university.
没错，但你要小心，因为宾夕法尼亚大学是一所私立大学。

199
Oh really?
哦，真的吗？

200
Yeah, it's an Ivy League school, so it's one of the oldest schools in America, and it's like Harvard or Yale.
是的，它是常春藤联盟学校，是美国最古老的学校之一，和哈佛或耶鲁一样。

201
It's very, very high quality.
质量非常高。

202
This is something that they always mention when talking about universities in the States.
这是他们在谈论美国大学时总是提到的事情。

203
They always say it's an Ivy League school, just like you said right now.
他们总是说这是常春藤联盟学校，就像你刚才说的那样。

204
What does it mean if a university is Ivy League?
如果一所大学是常春藤联盟学校，这意味着什么？

205
Well, League is just a group, right?
嗯，联盟只是一个团体，对吧？

206
And so some of the first universities in the United States formed this group called the Ivy League, and I think it used to have to do with the sports.
所以美国的一些第一所大学组成了一个叫常春藤联盟的团体，我认为这最初与体育有关。

207
These teams would play each other in sports, but I could be wrong.
这些队伍会在体育上相互比赛，但我可能错了。

208
Anyway, in the 18th century, these were schools for men, and there were seven Ivy League schools for men, and then there were the sister schools for women.
无论如何，在18世纪，这些学校是为男性设立的，有七所常春藤联盟学校是男性学校，然后还有女性的姐妹学校。

209
Wellesley, Radcliffe, these are the sister schools.
威尔斯利、拉德克利夫，这些是姐妹学校。

210
And so nowadays, both men and women can go to all these universities, and so we just talk about them as the Ivy Leagues, and the Ivy League schools that are most famous are Harvard, Yale, Brown, the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia, things like that.
如今，男性和女性都可以进入所有这些大学，所以我们只谈论它们作为常春藤联盟，最著名的常春藤联盟学校有哈佛、耶鲁、布朗、宾夕法尼亚大学、哥伦比亚等。

211
So talking about universities and colleges, I have heard also the community college.
说到大学和学院，我也听说过社区学院。

212
Yeah, that can be a lot more affordable.
是的，那通常更实惠。

213
Because it's a community college, it's usually something you go to back near your home.
因为社区学院通常是你在家附近的学校。

214
Because colleges and universities, sometimes people travel very, very far to go to these schools.
因为大学和学院，有时人们会远道而来上学。

215
But community colleges are available to people in your own community, and you can take night classes, you can do a lot of different things with them.
但社区学院对你所在社区的人开放，你可以上夜校，可以做很多不同的事情。

216
They're great resources, they're a lot more affordable than other schools, and a lot of people like to go to them because they don't have to pay these expensive fees for housing, like dorms, or for travel.
它们是很好的资源，比其他学校更实惠，很多人喜欢去，因为他们不必支付昂贵的住宿费用，比如宿舍，或旅行费用。

217
And they're a great option for people.
对人们来说是一个很好的选择。

218
So community colleges, colleges and universities are the major distinctions.
所以社区学院、学院和大学是主要的区别。

219
There is a lot to talk about on this subject, especially if you're a student, or you're a professional considering doing a master's abroad, or you want to go to the States or Canada to study.
在这个话题上有很多可以讨论的，特别是如果你是学生，或者你是考虑去国外攻读硕士的专业人士，或者你想去美国或加拿大学习。

220
There's a lot of things to take into consideration, so this is a great topic.
有很多事情需要考虑，所以这是一个很好的话题。

221
We really want to hear from you if you have any other questions or doubts.
如果你有其他问题或疑虑，我们真的很想听到你的声音。

222
You can always find us at EnglishPod.com.
你可以随时在EnglishPod.com找到我们。

223
We hope to see you guys there.
