5
So, Marco, today we've got a little bit of an unusual lesson because we're talking about hypothetical situations.
所以，Marco，今天我们有一堂有点不寻常的课，因为我们要讨论假设情况。

6
Right.
对。

7
We're talking about a unreal situation or something that may happen or may not happen.
我们在谈论一个不真实的情况，或者可能发生也可能不发生的事情。

8
Okay.
好的。

9
So, you're going to hear all about this in today's dialogue.
所以，你将在今天的对话中听到这些。

10
We're going to hear it a couple of times.
我们会听几次。

11
When we come back, we'll be breaking it down for you so you know all about these great phrases and how to talk about not real situations with your friends.
回来后，我们会为你解析这些短语，让你了解如何与朋友谈论不真实的情况。

12
Okay.
好的。

13
Next question.
下一个问题。

14
If Eric asked you out on a date, what would you say?
如果Eric约你出去，你会怎么说？

15
Duh.
当然。

16
I would say yes.
我会说是的。

17
Eric is the most popular kid in school.
Eric是学校里最受欢迎的孩子。

18
Okay.
好的。

19
My turn.
我的回合。

20
What would you do if you won the lottery?
如果你中了彩票，你会怎么做？

21
Let's see.
让我想想。

22
If I won the lottery, I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world.
如果我中了彩票，我会买两张环游世界的机票。

23
If you buy me a ticket, I'll go with you for sure.
如果你给我买一张票，我肯定会和你一起去。

24
My dad would freak out if I even mention a trip like that.
如果我提到这样的旅行，我爸爸会崩溃。

25
All right.
好吧。

26
This is a good one.
这个问题不错。

27
What would your mom say if you told her that you're going to get married?
如果你告诉你妈妈你要结婚了，她会怎么说？

28
If I told her that, she would faint and have me committed.
如果我告诉她，她会晕倒并把我送进精神病院。

29
All right.
好吧。

30
So, I think that was clear and, well, a very common situation.
所以，我认为这很清楚，而且是一个非常常见的情况。

31
Two teenage girls talking to each other about, you know, boys and what would you do and da-da-da.
两个青少年女孩在谈论，嗯，男孩和你会怎么做等等。

32
Guys do this too, so don't just put this on the girls, okay?
男孩们也这样做，所以不要只把这归咎于女孩，好吗？

33
I don't think we do it like this though.
我觉得我们不会这样做。

34
No, but it's actually a very popular game in the car to play.
不，但这实际上是车上一个非常流行的游戏。

35
The what-if game.
假设游戏。

36
The what-if game, exactly.
假设游戏，没错。

37
And that's exactly the topic that we want to talk about today is the structure what-if, which is actually called a conditional.
这正是我们今天想讨论的主题，即假设结构，实际上称为条件句。

38
All right.
好吧。

39
So, conditional because the results, the thing that happens depends on something else.
所以，条件句是因为结果，发生的事情取决于其他事情。

40
Exactly.
正是如此。

41
So, let's actually take a look at the words in today's language takeaway before we talk about all this grammar stuff.
所以，在我们讨论这些语法内容之前，先看看今天的语言要点。

42
Okay.
好的。

43
So, we'll start out with some basic words.
所以，我们先从一些基本词汇开始。

44
Well, you know, they were talking about guys.
嗯，你知道，他们在谈论男孩。

45
And she said, if Eric asked you out.
她说，如果Eric约你出去。

46
Right?
对吧？

47
So, to ask somebody out.
所以，约某人出去。

48
Okay.
好的。

49
So, this might be a little bit strange because you think, okay, to ask is to ask a question.
这可能有点奇怪，因为你会想，好的，问就是问一个问题。

50
But to ask out, it's a fixed phrase.
但约出去是一个固定短语。

51
It's something you say.
这是你说的东西。

52
These two words go together, right?
这两个词是一起的，对吧？

53
So, I want to ask someone out.
所以，我想约某人出去。

54
That means I want to invite someone on a date.
这意味着我想邀请某人约会。

55
On a romantic date, usually.
通常是浪漫的约会。

56
So, yeah, I want to ask him out to dinner or he asked me out to the movies.
所以，是的，我想邀请他共进晚餐，或者他邀请我去看电影。

57
Now, if I didn't want to ask somebody out on a romantic date, what verb would you use?
现在，如果我不想约某人出去，想约一个浪漫的约会，你会用什么动词？

58
I'd say you could invite someone out.
我会说你可以邀请某人出去。

59
But then again, it's always a little bit... Well, you can say invite for someone if you're going to ask them on a date too.
但话说回来，如果你要约他们出去，也可以说邀请。

60
So, I'd say to ask out is always romantic.
所以，我会说约出去总是浪漫的。

61
And to invite can be romantic or just friends.
而邀请可以是浪漫的，也可以只是朋友。

62
Okay.
好的。

63
So, to ask somebody out.
所以，约某人出去。

64
Now, they were talking about other situations.
现在，他们在谈论其他情况。

65
Maybe they would go on a trip or something.
也许他们会去旅行或其他什么。

66
And she said, my dad would freak out.
她说，我爸爸会崩溃。

67
This is a great phrase.
这是一个很好的短语。

68
This is something that I used a lot when I was a teenager.
这是我在青少年时期经常使用的。

69
The word freak out?
“崩溃”这个词？

70
Freak out.
崩溃。

71
So, the verb to freak out means to be really angry or upset or, you know, it could be a good thing or a bad thing.
所以，动词“崩溃”意味着非常生气或沮丧，或者，你知道，这可能是好事也可能是坏事。

72
But usually when we're talking about our parents, it's a bad thing.
但通常当我们谈论父母时，这是坏事。

73
It's a bad thing.
是坏事。

74
So, they get angry, they start yelling at you.
所以，他们会生气，开始对你大喊。

75
Yeah, so freak out means like overreact.
是的，所以崩溃意味着过度反应。

76
All right.
好吧。

77
And the last word that we have a language takeaway today is a committed.
今天我们语言要点的最后一个词是“被送进精神病院”。

78
Well, let's look at the whole phrase.
好吧，让我们看看整个短语。

79
He says, she would have me committed.
他说，她会把我送进精神病院。

80
So, this is actually being done to someone.
所以，这实际上是对某人做的事情。

81
Now, we did look at this word before, but basically for marriage, right?
现在，我们之前看过这个词，但基本上是指婚姻，对吧？

82
To commit to somebody, to promise.
承诺某人，许诺。

83
Yeah, but to have someone committed means that you're going to send them away to maybe a mental institution.
是的，但把某人送进精神病院意味着你要把他们送到精神病院。

84
Exactly.
正是如此。

85
So, this means they have psychological problems and someone else sends them to the hospital because they can't send themselves.
所以，这意味着他们有心理问题，其他人把他们送到医院，因为他们自己无法送自己。

86
Exactly.
正是如此。

87
So, it's always used to have someone committed, right?
所以，总是用“把某人送进精神病院”，对吧？

88
Right, because it's being done to them.
对，因为这是对他们做的事情。

89
They don't want it to happen.
他们不想发生。

90
It's involuntary.
这是非自愿的。

91
Okay, so she had him committed.
好的，所以她把他送进精神病院。

92
My mom's going to have me committed if I keep working 20 hours a day.
如果我继续每天工作20个小时，我妈妈会把我送进精神病院。

93
Exactly.
正是如此。

94
So, that's the way you use it.
所以，这就是你使用它的方式。

95
And so, now you have another way of using this verb.
现在，你又有了一种使用这个动词的方式。

96
But now, I think we should listen to this dialogue again.
但现在，我认为我们应该再听一次这个对话。

97
We're going to slow it down a little bit and then we'll come back and look at this grammar focus that we want to talk about.
我们会慢慢放，然后再回来看看我们想讨论的语法重点。

98
Okay, next question.
好的，下一个问题。

99
If Eric asks you out on a date, what would you say?
如果Eric约你出去，你会怎么说？

100
Duh, I would say yes.
当然，我会说是的。

101
Eric is the most popular kid in school.
埃里克是学校里最受欢迎的孩子。

102
Okay, my turn.
好的，轮到我了。

103
What would you do if you won the lottery?
如果你中了彩票，你会怎么做？

104
Let's see.
让我想想。

105
If I won the lottery, I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world.
如果我中了彩票，我会买两张环游世界的票。

106
If you buy me a ticket, I will go with you for sure.
如果你给我买一张票，我肯定会和你一起去。

107
My dad would freak out if I even mention a trip like that.
如果我提到这样的旅行，我爸爸会崩溃。

108
Alright, this is a good one.
好吧，这是个好问题。

109
What would your mom say if you told her you were going to get married?
如果你告诉你妈妈你要结婚，她会怎么说？

110
If I told her that, she would faint and have me committed.
如果我告诉她，她会晕倒并让我住院。

111
Alright, so we understood all the vocab now.
好吧，所以我们现在理解所有的词汇了。

112
Now, let's take a look at these unreal situations and what we were saying, the what-if game.
现在，让我们看看这些不真实的情况，以及我们所说的假设游戏。

113
Right, so I think it's important to push these into two different categories, right?
对，所以我认为将这些分成两类很重要，对吧？

114
We have one kind where it's very unrealistic.
我们有一种情况是非常不现实的。

115
It's probably not going to happen, that kind of situation.
这种情况可能不会发生。

116
And the other one is a situation that could very well happen, something that's probably very uncommon.
另一种情况是可能会发生的，虽然很少见。

117
Okay, so the first one we're going to talk about is very unrealistic situations, things that probably won't happen.
好的，所以我们要讨论的第一种是非常不现实的情况，可能不会发生的事情。

118
Okay, so let's take a look at an example that we found in the dialogue.
好的，让我们看看对话中找到的一个例子。

119
The most common one, and I think everybody gets asked this question, is if you won the lottery, what would you do?
最常见的一个，我想每个人都被问过这个问题，就是如果你中了彩票，你会怎么做？

120
Okay, if you won the lottery.
好的，如果你中了彩票。

121
So this is a situation that's very uncommon, right?
这是一个非常不常见的情况，对吧？

122
Not many people win the lottery.
很少有人中奖。

123
So we have to say, if you won the lottery.
所以我们必须说，如果你中了彩票。

124
So we use this verb in the past tense.
所以我们用这个动词的过去式。

125
If you won the lottery, if this happened, what would you do?
如果你中了彩票，如果发生了，你会怎么做？

126
Right, so Catherine, if you won the lottery, what would you do?
对，所以凯瑟琳，如果你中了彩票，你会怎么做？

127
If I won the lottery, I would buy a boat and sail around the world with my friends.
如果我中了彩票，我会买一艘船，和我的朋友环游世界。

128
Alright, so another example, again using the same structure, right, the verb in the simple past tense, we would say, if you were stuck on an island with one other person, who would that be?
好的，另一个例子，再次使用相同的结构，对吧，动词用简单过去式，我们会说，如果你和一个人被困在一个岛上，那个人会是谁？

129
Alright, so if you were stuck on a desert island with one person, who would that person be?
好的，如果你和一个人被困在荒岛上，那个人会是谁？

130
So Marco, I'm going to ask you, who would it be?
所以马尔科，我要问你，那会是谁？

131
I think it would be an engineer or a scientist that could probably get me off the island.
我想那会是一个工程师或科学家，可能能把我带出岛。

132
What about your girlfriend?
那你的女朋友呢？

133
Well, you know, that's the point if I can get to her quicker.
嗯，你知道，如果我能更快到达她那里，那就是重点。

134
Okay, I would say maybe kind of romantic.
好的，我会说可能有点浪漫。

135
So that's the first situation.
所以这是第一种情况。

136
We've got these situations like being stuck on an island, winning the lottery, these are very unlikely.
我们有这些情况，比如被困在岛上，中奖，这些都是非常不可能的。

137
But what about the other kind?
但另一种情况呢？

138
But before we move on to that, you notice that we use the verb was, we didn't say if I was on an island, I said if I were, right, or if you were.
但在我们继续之前，你注意到我们使用动词was，我们没有说如果我在一个岛上，我说如果我在，对吧，或者如果你在。

139
So this is the way that you use it in these conditionals.
所以这是你在这些条件句中使用的方式。

140
If I were you or if you were president of the United States.
如果我是你，或者如果你是美国总统。

141
Yeah, this is a rule.
是的，这是一个规则。

142
So this is a grammar rule.
所以这是一个语法规则。

143
We're not going to describe why it happens because it's very, very complicated and you can look it up on our site.
我们不会描述为什么会这样，因为这非常复杂，你可以在我们的网站上查找。

144
But we're going to describe how to use it.
但我们会描述如何使用它。

145
That's the most important.
这才是最重要的。

146
So we can say, for example, Marco, if I were you, I would... dye my hair red.
所以我们可以说，例如，马尔科，如果我是你，我会... 把头发染成红色。

147
Why?
为什么？

148
I don't know.
我不知道。

149
I think it would look cool.
我觉得这样看起来很酷。

150
I don't think so.
我不这么认为。

151
So if I were you, I would.
所以如果我是你，我会。

152
Or if you were me, what would you do?
或者如果你是我，你会怎么做？

153
Exactly.
正是如此。

154
So we always use it like this, right?
所以我们总是这样使用，对吧？

155
If you're subject.
如果你是主语。

156
Never was.
从来没有was。

157
Right.
对。

158
So you can tell this very, very big grammar issue.
所以你可以告诉这是一个非常非常大的语法问题。

159
A lot of English speakers make this mistake.
很多英语使用者会犯这个错误。

160
Very many.
非常多。

161
So but now you know that you shouldn't make this mistake and you can speak properly.
但现在你知道你不应该犯这个错误，你可以正确地说话。

162
All right.
好的。

163
So now that we've seen these semi-unreal situations, let's move on to something that's a little bit more probable that it may happen.
所以现在我们已经看到了这些半不真实的情况，让我们继续讨论一些更可能发生的事情。

164
Right.
对。

165
So we've got these situations that are common or likely.
所以我们有这些常见或可能的情况。

166
For example, in this lesson we hear, I will go with you for sure.
例如，在这节课中我们听到，我肯定会和你一起去。

167
So this is, if you buy me a ticket to travel, of course I will go with you.
所以这是，如果你给我买一张旅行的票，当然我会和你一起去。

168
So if you buy, this is in the present tense, if you buy, then I will.
所以如果你买，这是现在时，如果你买，那么我会。

169
Right.
对。

170
Right.
对。

171
So now you notice the difference.
所以现在你注意到区别了。

172
The verb is in the present and then we use, instead of would, we use will.
动词是现在时，然后我们用will代替would。

173
So again, I can say, if it rains tomorrow, I will stay home and watch TV all day.
所以我可以说，如果明天下雨，我会呆在家里整天看电视。

174
Okay.
好的。

175
So think about this.
所以想想这个。

176
Before we talked about going to desert islands, now we're talking about rain and the weather.
在我们谈论去荒岛之前，现在我们在谈论雨和天气。

177
They're very, very different.
这非常非常不同。

178
The rain is, you know, it's very common.
雨是，你知道的，非常常见。

179
So we can say, if it rains tomorrow, I will need an umbrella.

180
What about this?

181
If we have lunch tomorrow, what will we eat?
如果我们明天吃午饭，我们会吃什么？

182
Okay.
好的。

183
So we have lunch pretty much every day, right?
所以我们几乎每天都吃午饭，对吧？

184
Yeah, pretty much.
是的，差不多。

185
So again, it's a situation that is very probable.
所以再次，这是一个非常可能的情况。

186
So if we have lunch tomorrow, we will probably eat, I don't know, pasta, I think.
所以如果我们明天吃午饭，我们可能会吃，我不知道，意大利面，我想。

187
I'm feeling like pasta.
我想吃意大利面。

188
Pasta, noodles.
意大利面，面条。

189
Yeah.
是的。

190
All right.
好的。

191
So Marco, let's take another listen to some of these phrases and try and figure out while you're listening, which kind of conditional it is.
所以马尔科，让我们再听一些这些短语，试着在听的时候找出这是什么类型的条件句。

192
First or the second.
第一或第二。

193

202
So we heard different examples.
所以我们听到了不同的例子。

203
And the first conditional is the one that we mentioned is very probable.
第一条件句是我们提到的非常可能的情况。

204
And the second conditional is the one that's not so probable.
第二条件句是那些不太可能的情况。

205
So they're very easy to distinguish.
所以它们很容易区分。

206
You don't really need to know the names, just know how to use them, right?
你不需要知道名称，只需知道如何使用它们，对吧？

207
Exactly.
正是如此。

208
And so just remember, if you were me, what would you do?
所以只要记住，如果你是我，你会怎么做？

209
We've got these kind of pairs, these words that go together.
我们有这些成对的词，搭配在一起。

210
And the other one is more common.
另一个更常见。

211
It's, if we, if it rains tomorrow, I will bring an umbrella.

So why don't we listen to this dialogue for the last time, just to kind of reinforce everything, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.
那么我们为什么不最后再听一次这个对话，以巩固一下，然后我们再回来聊聊。

214
Okay, next question.

215
If Eric asked you out on a date, what would you say?

227
So Marco, if we talk any more about grammar, someone's gonna have to have me committed.
所以马尔科，如果我们再谈语法，可能会有人让我住院。

228
It is a little bit difficult to talk about grammar, especially on a podcast, because it's such a difficult topic, and it's also kind of heavy, right?
讨论语法确实有点困难，尤其是在播客中，因为这是一个很难的话题，而且也有点沉重，对吧？

229
It is, but I'll tell you this.
确实如此，但我告诉你，这些都是非常常见的短语。

230
These are very, very common phrases.
人们一直在使用这些。

231
People use these all the time.
我们经常用假设的方式交流。

232
We talk in hypotheticals very often.
所以如果你在寻求建议，或者在车里玩游戏，你会遇到这些，知道如何使用它们非常重要。
