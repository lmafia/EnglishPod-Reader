20
And what about the keyboard?

22
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we can only exchange or refund defective products.

23
We cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.

24
Fine.

25
I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.

26
All right.
好的。

27
We're back.
我们回来了。

28
So now let's take a look at some of those keywords on language takeaway.
现在让我们看看一些语言要点的关键词。

29
So we've got a great bunch of words for you here today.
今天我们为你准备了一些很棒的单词。

30
The first three are nouns, and then afterwards we've got a couple of adjectives to describe those nouns.
前三个是名词，之后是几个形容词来描述这些名词。

31
But first up, we have the word receipt.
首先，我们有“收据”这个词。

32
That's right.
没错。

33
So we want to return the television, and the worker there asks us if we have the receipt.
我们想退电视，工作人员问我们是否有收据。

34
Okay.
好的。

35
A receipt is a small piece of paper that you receive from a clerk or a server after you buy something.
收据是一小张纸，你在购买东西后从店员或服务员那里收到。

36
So if I buy a TV, I will have this small piece of paper that says that I paid $500 for the TV.
所以如果我买了一台电视，我会有这张小纸条，上面写着我为电视支付了500美元。

37
That's right.
没错。

38
So usually they will ask you for the receipt to see when you bought the product and if you bought the product at that store.
通常他们会要求你出示收据，以查看你何时购买了产品，以及你是否在那家商店购买的。

39
That's right.
没错。

40
So the receipt has all sorts of information, date, time, method of payment, cost, all those things.
所以收据上有各种信息，日期、时间、付款方式、费用，所有这些。

41
And it's very important if you ever want to return something.
如果你想退东西，这非常重要。

42
Now, later on in the dialogue, the character explains why he wants to return the TV.
现在，在对话中，角色解释了他想退电视的原因。

43
Now Marco, why does he want to do that?

44
Well, he has a problem with the TV when he's watching a movie.
嗯，他在看电影时遇到了电视的问题。

45
Basically, the image is not very clear.
基本上，画面不太清晰。

46
So this is the keyword image.
所以这是关键词“画面”。

47
So image can mean a couple of different things.
“画面”可以有几种不同的意思。

48
You might hear the word image to mean a photograph or a picture like on a computer.
你可能会听到“画面”这个词，指的是照片或计算机上的图片。

49
But in this case, the image is how well you can see the images on TV, the things on TV.
但在这种情况下，画面是指你在电视上看到的图像的清晰度。

50
That's right.
没错。

51
So on TV, it's like you're seeing many, many images all at once or very rapidly together.
所以在电视上，你就像是同时看到很多很多图像，或者非常快速地看到。

52
So maybe if you can't see clearly, you say that the image is not clear on the TV.
所以如果你看不清楚，你会说电视上的画面不清晰。

53
All right.
好的。

54
So if it's fuzzy, like there's gray and black, the image is not clear.
如果画面模糊，比如有灰色和黑色，画面就不清晰。

55
You can also say that, you know, I really like my new TV.
你也可以说，我真的很喜欢我的新电视。

56
The image is very clear.

That's right.

59
And not only are we returning a TV, but we're also returning a keyboard.

60
All right.
好的。

61
A keyboard, a key is something that you can push.
键盘，键是你可以按的东西。

62
But a keyboard is this thing that you use with your computer to type words.
但键盘是你用来在计算机上输入文字的东西。

63
That's right.
没错。

64
So many of you who are using the website as we speak are using a keyboard and a mouse.
所以你们中许多人在使用网站时正在使用键盘和鼠标。

65
So these are probably one of the two most well-known objects when you're using a computer.
所以这些可能是你使用计算机时最知名的两个物品之一。

66
That's right.
没错。

67
And keyboards come in many different shapes and sizes.
键盘有很多不同的形状和大小。

68
You can buy French keyboards and Russian keyboards.
你可以购买法语键盘和俄语键盘。

69
So keyboard is the general word for this tool.
所以“键盘”是这个工具的通用词。

70
Okay.
好的。

71
So we are returning the keyboard and the clerk explains that we can only return it if it is defective, if the product is defective.
所以我们正在退键盘，店员解释说只有在产品有缺陷时才能退。

72
All right.
好的。

73
So this is one of those adjectives I talked about a minute ago.
这就是我刚才提到的形容词之一。

74
Adjectives describe things.

75
So my keyboard is defective or this TV is defective.
所以我的键盘是有缺陷的，或者这台电视是有缺陷的。

76
That means it doesn't work.

81
And, well, the guy was complaining that he didn't understand why these things like the keyboard are so delicate.
而且，这个家伙抱怨说他不明白为什么像键盘这样的东西这么脆弱。

82
All right.
好的。

83
Delicate is something you might see written on the side of a box when you receive a package.
“脆弱”是你在收到包裹时可能会在盒子侧面看到的字。

84
Something that is delicate breaks very easily.
脆弱的东西很容易破碎。

85
That's right.
没错。

So, for example, glass is very delicate.
例如，玻璃是非常脆弱的。

88
It can break easily.
它很容易破碎。

89

115
The first verb we have today here in Fluency Builder is the main verb in today's dialogue, to return.
今天在“流利构建”中我们有的第一个动词是对话中的主要动词，退。

116

117
Okay, so when you want to give back a product, you don't say, I want to give back or anything like this.

118
You say, I want to return this product.

120
It's giving back and getting your money back.

121
That's right.

122
So to return means that you bring back the product, and the store will give you back your money.
所以退意味着你把产品带回，商店会把钱还给你。

123
That's right.
没错。

124
And he wanted to return the TV, as we mentioned, because the image was not very clear.
他想退电视，因为如我们所提到的，画面不太清晰。

125
But he also mentioned that the TV flickers a lot.
但他还提到电视闪烁很多。

126
So what is this, to flicker?

127
To flicker is another verb.
闪烁是另一个动词。

128
And flicker is something that things with light do.

129
The light flickers, the TV flickers.

130
It means the light comes on and off, on and off, on and off.
这意味着光亮开又关，开又关，开又关。

So dark light, dark light.
所以暗光，暗光。

132
It's not very steady.
这不是很稳定。

133
It's not like there's light or dark.
不是说有光或暗。

134
And so this is very annoying when you're watching TV because it goes light, dark, light, dark, and it's hard to see what's happening.
所以在你看电视时这非常烦人，因为它亮，暗，亮，暗，很难看清发生了什么。

135

137
That's the same thing that's happening with the TV.
这就是电视发生的事情。

All right, so we wanted to actually return these goods.
好吧，所以我们想要退这些商品。

143
And the clerk explained that we can exchange or we can refund defective products.
店员解释说我们可以换或退不合格的产品。

144
Okay, these are two important verbs.
好的，这两个动词很重要。

145
Exchange means to trade one thing for another.
交换意味着用一种东西换另一种东西。

147
I can exchange Japanese yen for American dollars.

但在商店，比如电子商店，我可以把我不喜欢的电视换成一个很好的MP3播放器或类似的东西。

150
So that's what happens usually if maybe your TV is broken or it had some problem, you exchange it for a new one, right?
所以如果你的电视坏了或有问题，通常会换成新的，对吧？

151
But maybe you don't want the TV anymore.
但也许你不想要电视了。

152
Maybe you changed your mind.

153
So you want to get a refund.

所以退款，你听到这个词“fund”，它与钱有关。

155
A refund means that the store will give you all your money back.
退款意味着商店会把你所有的钱还给你。

156
So if I refund my TV, I give my TV to the store, the store gives me $500 or whatever the money for the TV was.
所以如果我退我的电视，我把电视给商店，商店给我500美元或电视的价格。

157

160
Very different from exchanging the goods.
与交换商品非常不同。

161
And finally, the clerk explained that they cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.
最后，店员解释说他们不能对误用或损坏负责。

162
So remember this as a phrase.
所以记住这个短语。

163
This is really important to take responsibility.

164
It means that if something goes wrong, you will take responsibility for it.
这意味着如果发生错误，你会对此负责。

165
You will handle it.
你会处理它。

166
Alright, so for example, the store says that it can't take responsibility if something is broken.
好吧，例如，商店说如果有什么东西坏了，他们不能承担责任。

167
That means that they won't pay you back money.
这意味着他们不会还你钱。

168
That's right.
没错。

169
So if you buy a TV and you accidentally get it wet or you get water inside and this is why it gets damaged, then the store cannot take responsibility for this damage.
所以如果你买了一台电视，意外弄湿了或者水进去了，这就是它损坏的原因，那么商店不能对这个损坏负责。

170
Or you could say it the other way around.
或者你可以反过来说。

171
You could say, if you're at the office and you make a mistake on a report, you say, listen boss, I'm really sorry.
你可以说，如果你在办公室里在报告上犯了错误，你会说，老板，我真的很抱歉。

172
I take full responsibility for this mistake.
我对这个错误承担全部责任。

173
You can punish me or you can make me do it again.
你可以惩罚我，或者让我要我重做。

174
But I take responsibility means that I say it's my fault.
但我承担责任意味着我说这是我的错。

175
Right, you're guilty.
对，你有罪。

176
Alright, so that's all we have for Fluency Builder.
好吧，这就是我们在“流利构建”中要讲的全部内容。

177
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time and we can review everything we've just learned.
让我们最后再听一遍对话，复习一下我们刚学到的所有内容。

178

183
The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear.
电视在我看电影时闪烁很多，有时画面不太清晰。

185
And what about the keyboard?

188
We cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.
我们不能对误用或损坏负责。

189
Fine.
好吧。

190
I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.
我不知道为什么他们做的东西这么脆弱。

191
So returning goods is a very useful thing if you maybe bought a TV at a department store or an electronic store.
所以退货是非常有用的，如果你在百货商店或电子商店买了电视。

192
Then you would want to return it if you had some problems.
如果你有一些问题，你会想退它。

193
Now, how easy or difficult is it to do?
现在，退货有多容易或困难呢？

194
Because in theory, in the dialogue, it seems like it's really easy.
因为在理论上，在对话中，它似乎真的很简单。

195
It depends on the store, of course.
当然，这取决于商店。

196
So some stores make it easier to do this, some stores make it harder.
所以有些商店让这变得更容易，有些商店则更困难。

197
I can tell you in most stores, if you don't have a receipt, it's probably very difficult.
我可以告诉你，在大多数商店，如果你没有收据，可能会非常困难。

198
Really?
真的？

199
Yes.
是的。

200
But a lot of stores have something else that they sell you or give you when you buy something.
但很多商店在你购买东西时会卖给你或给你一些其他东西。

201
It's called a warranty.
这叫做保修。

202
And this is something that will help protect you if you take the TV home and you have a problem.
这会帮助保护你，如果你把电视带回家后遇到问题。

203
That means that they will come fix it or they will give you a new one without any questions about what happened.
这意味着他们会来修理，或者会给你一个新的，不会问发生了什么。

204
Now, not only can you return goods such as TVs, electronics, or maybe clothes, but in some cases also things that you buy at the supermarket, like maybe chicken.
现在，不仅可以退货像电视、电子产品或衣服这样的商品，在某些情况下，超市购买的东西，比如鸡肉，也可以退。

205
I've heard that maybe sometimes you buy chicken and you open it up that same day and it's gone bad.
我听说有时候你买的鸡肉当天打开就坏了。

206
Really?
真的？

207
I've never had that experience, but I think it makes sense.
我从来没有过这样的经历，但我觉得这很有道理。

208
It depends where you buy it, of course.
当然，这取决于你在哪里买。

209
Right, obviously at a supermarket and you show the receipt, or maybe milk, maybe that's gone bad sometimes, or yogurt.
对，显然是在超市，你出示收据，或者牛奶，有时候可能也坏了，或者酸奶。

210
Well, because they probably shouldn't sell it if it's bad.
嗯，因为如果坏了，他们可能不应该卖。

211
Exactly.
正是如此。

212
So if you tell them that they sold you bad milk, they'll give you a new one.
所以如果你告诉他们卖给你坏牛奶，他们会给你一个新的。

213
Exactly.
正是如此。

214
So that's called an exchange.
这叫做换货。

215
You would exchange the bad one for the good one.
你会把坏的换成好的。

216
Right, you wouldn't get your money back.
对，你不会拿回你的钱。

217
No, maybe.
不，可能不会。

218
Maybe not, maybe.
可能不会，可能会。

219
Alright, so that's all the time we have for today, but this is actually a very interesting topic because it has to do a lot with customer service.
好吧，今天我们只有这些时间，但这是一个非常有趣的话题，因为它与客户服务有很大关系。

220
So let us know what your experience is with customer service, with returning something.
所以让我们知道你在客户服务和退货方面的经历。

221
Is it very easy, very difficult?

222
Maybe some stores don't even accept returns.

They say once you buy it, you cannot return it.

224
All sales final.
