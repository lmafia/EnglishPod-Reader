那么她是怎么和她谈的？

126
She talked to her over the phone.

127
That's right.

So this is a really good phrase to specify that you received information or you did business talking on the phone, not in person.
这是一个很好的短语，说明你是通过电话而不是面对面获得信息或进行业务的。

Okay, so this is a bit strange because we use the preposition over.

154
Alright, and he said that I'll try to fill in the details.

186
Well, what other questions do you have, Rebecca?
那么，Rebecca，你还有什么其他问题？

187
Alright, so talking about salaries and remuneration packages.
好的，谈谈薪水和薪酬包。

188
Now, is this a common word to talk about remuneration?
现在，谈论薪酬是一个常见的词吗？

189
Yes, it is.
是的，是的。

190
It basically means the way that you are paid for the work that you do.
它基本上意味着你为所做的工作获得的报酬方式。

191
So remuneration, it sounds like a big long word.
所以薪酬，听起来像个大长词。

192
But in America, I think we also just talk about salary or compensation.
但在美国，我认为我们也只是谈论薪水或补偿。

193
Compensation packages.
补偿包。

194
Now, when we talk about remuneration, we don't necessarily always talk about money.
现在，当我们谈论薪酬时，我们不一定总是谈论金钱。

195
Like in this case, right?
就像在这种情况下，对吧？

196
We can receive other benefits.
我们可以获得其他福利。

197
That's right.
没错。

198
And so a lot of times people think of the important parts of remuneration not just to be the salary but also to be the benefits.
所以很多时候，人们认为报酬的重要部分不仅是薪水，还有福利。

199
And so benefits are not the money, they are the other stuff.
所以福利不是钱，而是其他东西。

200
They are healthcare.
它们是医疗保健。

201
We said earlier a housing allowance.
我们之前说过住房津贴。

202
Even bonuses and things like that or education for your children.
甚至奖金和孩子的教育。

203
These are extras and these are a part of the package.
这些都是额外的，都是套餐的一部分。

204
Now, what would you prefer?
现在，你更喜欢什么？

205
To have a good remuneration package like these other additional benefits with a low salary or would you prefer to have a high salary with not many of these benefits?
拥有一个好的报酬套餐，比如这些额外福利，薪水低，还是更喜欢高薪水但没有太多福利？

206
Well, I think that it's nice to get the benefits and a lower salary because often times at a company, like a big company, the company can get really good rates on healthcare.
嗯，我认为获得福利和较低薪水是不错的，因为在大公司，通常公司能获得很好的医疗保健费率。

207
So if I have to pay for my healthcare with my big salary, maybe it will cost me more money.
所以如果我必须用我的高薪支付医疗保健，可能会花更多钱。

208
But if my company pays with the company rate, that means the amount that they pay, then maybe they can help me pay for these things much cheaper.
但如果我的公司以公司费率支付，那意味着他们支付的金额，可能会帮我更便宜地支付这些费用。

209
And so in the end, I make more money.
所以最终，我赚得更多。

210
Actually, I've heard some companies that offer great remuneration packages like if you have children, as you said, they will pay for their education.
实际上，我听说一些公司提供很好的报酬套餐，比如如果你有孩子，正如你所说，他们会支付教育费用。

211
But many times they would even pay for their childcare, like maybe a nanny.
但很多时候，他们甚至会支付儿童保育费用，比如保姆。

212
Some of them, some of the managers would receive maybe a fuel bonus.
一些经理可能会获得燃油津贴。

213
So they would get, I don't know, $200 extra a month for fuel for their car if they drive to work.
所以他们可能每月多获得200美元的燃油补贴，如果他们开车上班。

214
So I think companies can get a little bit creative and it's not that much that they're actually spending, but you take it as to being a really good benefit.
所以我认为公司可以稍微有点创意，实际上他们花费的并不多，但你会觉得这是一个很好的福利。

215
Well, that's right.
嗯，没错。

216
And it makes you more, I think, happy to work for that company because you feel like they're taking care of you, not just they're giving you money.
这让我觉得更快乐为那家公司工作，因为你觉得他们在照顾你，而不仅仅是给你钱。

217
They're actually taking care of you and your family.
他们实际上在照顾你和你的家人。

218
That's right.
没错。

219
So we're actually a little bit curious to know how remuneration packages work in your company or maybe in your country.
所以我们实际上有点好奇你们公司或你们国家的报酬套餐是如何运作的。

220
That's right.
没错。

221
So please let us know.
所以请告诉我们。

222
You obviously don't have to tell us how much money you earn.
你显然不必告诉我们你赚多少钱。

223
But if you want to tell us how these things work, where you come from, our website is EnglishPod.com.
