Vocabulary Preview Okay, so the first word is actually the technical word that describes being unable to sleep.
词汇预览 第一个单词是描述失眠的专业术语。

9
It's called insomnia.
叫做失眠。

10
Right, so if you have insomnia, it means that you can't fall asleep, you can't sleep.
对，如果你失眠，意味着你无法入睡，无法睡觉。

11
Okay, so this is a pretty serious condition.
这是一种相当严重的状况。

例如，如果你失眠，三四天不睡觉，你在工作上表现不会很好，对吧？

13
Right, or if you're studying, you're tired at school, you can't concentrate, so it's a very big problem.

So, for example, if someone's really, really tired, you say, you look dreadful.

87
And he was explaining what he does to try to fall asleep.

89
And he also said that he tried different breathing techniques.

但在这种情况下，我们谈论的是呼吸技巧。

93
So for some people, one breathing technique is breathing in through your nose and breathing out through your mouth.
对于某些人来说，一种呼吸技巧是通过鼻子吸气，通过嘴巴呼气。

94
Like that.
就像这样。

95
That's one kind of technique.

So a technique, as you say, is a way of doing something.
所以技巧，正如你所说，是做某事的方法。

So maybe you will relax, so maybe you'll fall asleep, things like this.

And well, moving on, he was talking about his nightmares.

113
And he described his nightmares as disturbing.
他形容他的噩梦是令人不安的。

114
He has disturbing nightmares.
他有令人不安的噩梦。

115
Okay.
好的。

116
Well, I think this is an important word to cover here, Marco, because we've heard the verb to disturb before.
我认为这是一个重要的词，Marco，因为我们之前听过动词“打扰”。

117
Like, I'm sorry to disturb you.
比如，我很抱歉打扰你。

118
Means I'm sorry to bother you.
意思是我很抱歉打扰你。

119
But disturbing is an adjective.
但“令人不安”是一个形容词。

120
It describes something that makes me very uncomfortable.
它描述的是让我感到非常不舒服的事物。

121
Right.
对。

122
So, for example, a lot of times in the news, we see very disturbing images, car accidents or fires or bombs.
例如，很多时候在新闻中，我们看到非常令人不安的图像，车祸、火灾或炸弹。

123
And what's disturbing is when you see human beings who have been hurt.
令人不安的是，当你看到受伤的人类。

124
So, images that make you really uncomfortable or sad, these are disturbing.
所以，让你感到非常不舒服或悲伤的图像，这些都是令人不安的。

125
Exactly.
正是如此。

126
So, disturbing nightmares are nightmares that are not very pleasant.
所以，令人不安的噩梦是那些不太愉快的噩梦。

127
They make him scared maybe or uncomfortable.
它们可能让他感到害怕或不舒服。

128
Right.
对。

129
Like a dream, for example, where your parents die.
比如，一个梦，父母去世。

130
It's pretty disturbing.
这非常令人不安。

131
All right.
好吧。

132
And well, one of his friends recommended, you know what?
他的一个朋友建议，你知道吗？

133
Stop with all of this.
停止这一切。

134
Just take some sedatives.
只需服用一些镇静剂。

135
Okay.
好的。

136
So, sedatives are a kind of medicine that help a person relax or that help make a person tired.
所以，镇静剂是一种帮助人放松或让人感到疲倦的药物。

137
Right.
对。

138
So, I think it comes from the verb to sedate.
所以，我认为它来自动词“镇静”。

139
Yes.
是的。

140
And basically, that is to calm down, to tranquilize.
基本上，就是让人冷静下来，镇静。

141
That's right.
没错。

142
So, in this case, we're talking about a person, but you can also give an animal sedatives.
所以，在这种情况下，我们谈论的是一个人，但你也可以给动物使用镇静剂。

143
For example, if you want to take your dog on an airplane, the dog needs to relax.
例如，如果你想带你的狗上飞机，狗需要放松。

144
You give it some sedatives.
你给它一些镇静剂。

145
Exactly.
正是如此。

146
And I think when he mentioned a specific name of a sedative, it's Melatonin.
我认为当他提到某种特定的镇静剂时，是褪黑激素。

147
That's right.
没错。

148
So, Melatonin is a chemical that our bodies naturally produce that help calm us down.
所以，褪黑激素是我们身体自然产生的一种化学物质，帮助我们冷静下来。

149
And so, a lot of pharmaceutical companies or drug companies sell Melatonin in a pill form.
因此，许多制药公司或药品公司以药丸形式出售褪黑激素。

150
It's basically, it's a chemical that helps you relax.
基本上，它是一种帮助你放松的化学物质。

151
Exactly.
正是如此。

152
So, obviously, if you take Melatonin, you're going to feel sleepy or you're going to be very relaxed and you're going to fall asleep a lot easier.
所以，显然，如果你服用褪黑激素，你会感到困倦，或者你会非常放松，入睡会容易得多。

153
Well, hopefully.
好吧，希望如此。

154
Hopefully.
希望如此。

155
That's right.
没错。

156
So, and well, the whole thing that we've been talking about, insomnia, sleepwalking, these are called sleeping disorders.
所以，关于我们一直在谈论的失眠、梦游，这些被称为睡眠障碍。

157
Right.
对。

158
Or you might also hear the term sleep disorders.
或者你也可能听到“睡眠障碍”这个术语。

159
They mean problems with sleeping.
它们意味着睡眠问题。

160
So, people who either cannot fall asleep or people who have bad dreams or people who sleepwalk.
所以，无法入睡的人，或者做噩梦的人，或者梦游的人。

161
Exactly.
正是如此。

162
So, a disorder is something of an illness or a condition that is not normal.
所以，障碍是指一种疾病或不正常的状态。

163
So, for example, as you said, a sleeping disorder or a sleep disorder, it means that you're not able to sleep properly or normally.
例如，正如你所说，睡眠障碍或睡眠问题，意味着你无法正常入睡。

164
But there are other kinds of disorders, right?
但还有其他类型的障碍，对吧？

165
Right.
对。

166
I guess many people have heard of eating disorders.
我想很多人听说过饮食障碍。

167
Okay.
好的。

168
So, that's basically people who do not eat like everyone else.
所以，这基本上是指那些饮食方式与其他人不同的人。

169
Exactly.
正是如此。

170
So, that's what happens with a disorder.
所以，这就是障碍的表现。

171
All right.
好吧。

172
So, we've taken a look at a lot of vocab.
所以，我们已经看了很多词汇。

173
Now, it's time for us to take a look at Fluency Builder.
