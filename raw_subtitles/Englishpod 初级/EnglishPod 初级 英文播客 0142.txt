39
To iron.
熨烫。

40
Or iron.

41
So to iron basically means to... To get the wrinkles out of clothes.

60
I think they're called that because they sound like flip flop, flip flop.

这个丈夫听起来很像一位著名的总统，我觉得。

88
He did, but we'll get to that in a minute.
确实如此，但我们一会儿再谈。

89
Before we do talk about who this guy is, I think it'd be a great idea to talk about some of these clothing terms, because they're very useful for when you want to go shopping and for when you're getting dressed.
在我们谈论这个家伙是谁之前，我觉得谈谈一些这些服装术语是个好主意，因为它们在你想购物和穿衣服时非常有用。

90
Language takeaway.
语言收获。

91
Okay, so the first word that we have on language takeaway is striped.
好吧，所以我们在语言收获中第一个词是条纹。

92
All right, you might have heard the American flag called stars and stripes.
好吧，你可能听过美国国旗被称为星条旗。

93
Stripes are those lines on clothing or on flags that go up or down or left and right.
条纹是衣服或旗帜上上下或左右的线条。

94
Exactly.
正是如此。

95
So you have, if you have a striped shirt, you have many lines on your shirt that are going up and down or left and right.
所以如果你有一件条纹衬衫，你的衬衫上有许多上下或左右的线条。

96
Right.
对。

97
And they say with fashion, lines that go left to right make you look fatter and lines that go up and down make you look thinner.
他们说在时尚中，左右的线条会让你看起来更胖，而上下的线条会让你看起来更瘦。

98
And taller.

100
Very good.

And now moving on, if it's summer and you want to wear a shirt, you can wear a short-sleeved shirt.
现在继续，如果是夏天，你想穿衬衫，可以穿短袖衬衫。

102
All right, this is important.
好的，这很重要。

103
So most people like to wear short-sleeve shirts in the summertime because they're cooler.
所以大多数人夏天喜欢穿短袖衬衫，因为它们更凉快。

104
And in the wintertime, that means we like to wear long-sleeved shirts.
冬天，我们喜欢穿长袖衬衫。

105
Okay, so the sleeves are basically the arms of the shirt.
好的，袖子基本上就是衬衫的臂部。

106
Exactly.
正确。

107
So you say short-sleeved.
所以你说短袖。

108
Very good.
非常好。

109
And then we have a checkered shirt or a checkered sweater in this case.
然后我们有一件格子衬衫或在这种情况下的格子毛衣。

110
Okay, so checkered means there are little squares on the shirt.
好的，格子意味着衬衫上有小方块。

111
And usually one square is one color and then next square is another color.
通常一个方块是一个颜色，下一个方块是另一种颜色。

112
So it looks like a checkerboard.
所以看起来像棋盘。

113
Very good.
非常好。

114
That game, you know, checkers.
那个游戏，你知道的，跳棋。

115
Or like a chessboard.

117
And so in this case, we've got a guy who's trying to wear a striped shirt and a checkered sweater.
所以在这种情况下，我们有一个人试图穿条纹衬衫和格子毛衣。

118
That does not go well to us, right?
这对我们来说不太合适，对吧？

119
No.
不。

120
Too much stuff happening.
太多东西了。

121
It's too busy.
太繁杂了。

122
Too busy.

123
All right.
好的。

124
And not only that, but he wanted to wear shorts because he liked the cut and the hemline.
不仅如此，他还想穿短裤，因为他喜欢剪裁和下摆。

125
Okay, these are actually terms that we normally use with women's clothing because you could say, I like the cut of this dress.
好的，这实际上是我们通常用在女性服装上的术语，因为你可以说，我喜欢这条裙子的剪裁。

126
I like the shape that it has.
我喜欢它的形状。

127
Very good.
非常好。

128
And hemline is the bottom of your skirt or your trousers or your shorts.
下摆是裙子、裤子或短裤的底部。

129
And hemline, we could say, my mother used to say this to me, the hemline is much too high.
下摆，我可以说，我妈妈以前对我说，下摆太高了。

130
Much too short.
太短了。

131
That skirt is not appropriate.
那条裙子不合适。

132
Yeah.
是的。

133
So it's nice to have a hemline at the knee.
所以在膝盖处有一个下摆是不错的。

134
All right.
好的。

135
So the cut is the shape that the piece of clothing has, like pants or skirts.
所以剪裁是衣服的形状，比如裤子或裙子。

136
And the hemline would be the place where it ends, right?
下摆就是它结束的地方，对吧？

137
The skirt, for example.
比如裙子。

138
Like, it pretty much tells you the length of something.
就是，它基本上告诉你某物的长度。

139
Very good.

嗯，这就是其中之一。

158
And, and then she's also telling him to wear some corduroy pants.
然后她还告诉他穿一些灯芯绒裤子。

159
Okay, so it sounds like this might be a winter dialogue because corduroy is not something you wear in the summer because it's very heavy and thick.
好的，这听起来像是冬天的对话，因为灯芯绒不是夏天穿的东西，因为它很重很厚。

160
Corduroy actually is a fabric that that usually has these kind of ribs or ridges.
灯芯绒实际上是一种通常有这些肋条或纹理的面料。

161
And so there's like little lines in the fabric that make it quite thick and rough when you almost not rough, but they make it feel very unique when you touch it.
所以面料上有小线条，使它在触摸时感觉非常独特。

还有另一个常见短语，尤其是对于没有时尚感的男性。

212
The wife says, what am I going to do with you?
妻子说，我该如何处理你？

213
Okay, this is an interesting phrase and it needs some explanation, I think, because the meaning is, well, this is very difficult, right?

I'm going to help you.
我会帮助你。

216
How am I going to help you this much or all the time like this?

217
Right, because she's pretty much saying he has no idea about clothing and fashion.

218
So she he's saying to her, what am she saying to him?
所以她在对他说，我该如何处理你意味着你需要很多帮助。

219
What am I going to do with you means you need so much help.
真的。

220
Seriously.
好吧。

221
All right.
所以，第三个短语是我们在一开始看到的时尚感。

222
So, and, and the third phrase that we said with that we saw and we said at the very beginning is fashion sense.
好吧，这实际上是男人需要帮助的地方。

223
Okay, so this is actually what the man needs help with.
他需要时尚感的帮助，因为他没有时尚感。

224
He needs help with his fashion sense because he has zero fashion sense.
这基本上是说某人对时尚或外表了解多少。

225
And this is pretty much a way to say how much someone knows about fashion or appearances.
所以我可以说，你知道，我的朋友凯西，她有很棒的时尚感。

226
And so I can say, you know, oh, my friend Kathy, she has amazing fashion sense.
所以她总是看起来很好。

227
So she always looks good.
对。

228
Right.
所以适当地搭配颜色或穿着合适类型的鞋子与合适类型的衣服，等等，时尚感。

229
So combining colors appropriately or wearing the right types of shoes with the right types of clothing, et cetera, fashion sense.

230
Even just being able to wear things that are good on her or telling other people what's good on them.
甚至只是能够穿着适合她的衣服或告诉其他人什么适合他们。

231
So fashion sense is the ability to identify fashion and look good and make other people look good.
