Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.
大家好，欢迎来到EnglishPod。

2
My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

3
My name is Catherine, and today we are cleaning, right Marco?
我叫Catherine，今天我们要打扫，对吗Marco？

4
That's right.
没错。

5
Today we are cleaning our house.
今天我们要打扫我们的房子。

6
It's not one of our favorite activities, but we have to do it.
这不是我们最喜欢的活动，但我们必须做。

7
And so we're going to take a look at a lot of great vocab related to, you know, household chores.
所以我们将看看很多与家庭琐事相关的好词汇。

8
That's right.
没错。

9
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue.
那么让我们来听今天的对话。

10
Kevin, what is this mess?
Kevin，这是什么乱七八糟的？

11
It looks like a pigsty in here.
这里看起来像个猪圈。

12
Clean this up.
把它清理干净。

13
Okay, Dad, I will do it in a minute.
好的，爸爸，我马上就做。

14
Let me just finish this level of this game.
让我先完成这个游戏的关卡。

15
No, I said now.
不，我说现在。

16
Plus, you are grounded.
而且，你被禁足了。

17
You're not allowed to play video games.
你不允许玩电子游戏。

18
I want you to make your bed, do the laundry, and then come downstairs and sweep the floors.
我希望你整理床铺，洗衣服，然后下来扫地。

19
That's so unfair.
这太不公平了。

20
You have to pull your weight around here, young man.
你必须在这里分担责任，小伙子。

21
My house, my rules.
我家，我的规则。

22
But I already mopped the floors, dusted the furniture, and vacuumed the rugs.
但我已经拖过地，擦过家具，还吸过地毯。

23
That's great, but you still have work to do, so get to it.
很好，但你还有工作要做，所以快去做吧。

24
So today on Language Takeaway, let's take a look at all the verbs and all the ways that we have to clean the house.
所以今天在Language Takeaway，我们来看看所有的动词和我们打扫房子的方式。

25
So starting with the first one, we have to make the bed.
首先，我们要整理床铺。

26
Make your bed.
整理床铺。

27
Make your bed.
整理床铺。

28
Okay, so this might sound quite strange because the verb to make is something we say for a lot of different things, like make a deal.
好的，这听起来可能有点奇怪，因为动词“make”在很多不同的事情中都可以用，比如“make a deal”。

29
Make a mistake.
“make a mistake”。

30
Make a mistake.
“make a mistake”。

31
But here we're making the bed.
但这里我们是整理床铺。

32
That means we're putting the pillows on top of the bed, and we're going to make sure the blanket is even.
这意味着我们把枕头放在床上，并确保毯子平整。

33
So when you get out of bed, if everything is very messy, when you make it, you put everything in order on your bed.
所以当你起床时，如果一切都很乱，当你整理时，你把床上的一切都整理好。

34
That's right.
没错。

35
And it's also confusing because our next verb is to do the laundry.
这也很困惑，因为我们的下一个动词是“洗衣服”。

36
All right, so you make your bed, but you do the laundry.
好吧，所以你整理床铺，但你洗衣服。

37
The laundry here means you clean the dirty clothes.
“洗衣服”是指你清洗脏衣服。

38
Right, right.
对，对。

39
So this is one of the very, I would say, confusing parts of English where it's kind of confusing when to use the verb make, when to use the verb do.
这实际上是英语中非常令人困惑的部分之一，什么时候用“make”，什么时候用“do”。

40
So usually you make a mistake, as we say, or you make a cake, but you do your homework.
通常我们说“make a mistake”或“make a cake”，但你要“do your homework”。

41
So it's just, in these cases, you just kind of have to memorize that you make the bed, but you do the laundry.
所以在这些情况下，你只需记住整理床铺是“make”，而洗衣服是“do”。

42
Exactly.
正是如此。

43
So this is very common, actually, to do the laundry.
所以“洗衣服”其实是很常见的。

44
I have to go do the laundry today because it's an event.
我今天得去洗衣服，因为这是个活动。

45
You know, you have to gather your clothes and put in the detergent and wash it and dry it.
你知道，你得收集衣服，放入洗涤剂，洗涤和烘干。

46
So just remember, make the bed, do the laundry.
所以记住，整理床铺，洗衣服。

47
But then how do we clean those floors?
但我们怎么清理地板呢？

48
All right.
好吧。

49
So the floor, we have to do two things.
所以地板，我们要做两件事。

50
We sweep the floors.
我们扫地。

51
So the verb there is to sweep.
所以这里的动词是“扫”。

52
And how do you sweep?
你怎么扫呢？

53
You actually use a broom to sweep.
你实际上是用扫帚来扫。

54
So the broom is like a straw.
所以扫帚就像一根稻草。

55
It's like a brush almost that you use on the floor.
它几乎像是你在地板上使用的刷子。

56
And you collect all of the hair and the dust and these things, and you put it into the garbage bin.
你收集所有的头发和灰尘，然后把它放进垃圾桶。

57
Right.
对。

58
Right.
对。

59
But after you sweep, then you need to use water to clean because obviously sweeping is just for dry things.
但在你扫完后，你需要用水来清洁，因为显然扫只是针对干的东西。

60
Mopping is actually how you clean with water and soap.
拖地实际上是用水和肥皂来清洁。

61
That's right.
没错。

62
So now the verb there is to mop the floors.
所以这里的动词是“拖地”。

63
And usually you use water, you use soap, and you use a mop.
通常你用水、肥皂和拖把。

64
So you use a mop to mop.
所以你用拖把来拖地。

65
Exactly.
正是如此。

66
The verb is to mop.
动词是“拖地”。

67
The noun, the object is a mop, like you say.
名词，物体是拖把，就像你说的。

68
So I'm going to mop the floors, right?
所以我要拖地，对吧？

69
So please don't come into the kitchen.
所以请不要进厨房。

70
Right.
对。

71
Right.
对。

72
Okay.
好的。

73
And well, now we need to clean the furniture.
现在我们需要清理家具。

74
And usually on the furniture, we have a lot of dust.
通常家具上有很多灰尘。

75
So we need to dust the furniture.
所以我们需要擦拭家具。

76
To dust.
擦拭。

77
To dust.
擦拭。

78
Yeah, this is something we don't use for the floors really because we have this great verb, to sweep.
是的，这在地板上我们并不常用，因为我们有这个很好的动词“扫”。

79
But with furniture and things like that, we say to dust, and this means we're going to collect the dust off of the piano or the sofa or the table.
但对于家具和类似的东西，我们说“擦拭”，这意味着我们要把钢琴、沙发或桌子上的灰尘收集起来。

80
Right.
对。

81
Exactly.
正是如此。

82
And now the floors we clean, the furniture we clean, but sometimes we have rugs or we have carpet in our house, usually in the bedrooms, or we have a large rug in the living room.
现在我们清理了地板，清理了家具，但有时我们家里有地毯或地垫，通常在卧室，或者在客厅有一块大地毯。

83
And we need to clean that as well, but we don't really mop it and we don't sweep it.
我们也需要清理它，但我们并不真的拖它，也不扫它。

84
It's best to vacuum it.
最好是吸尘。

85
All right.
好的。

86
So the verb is to vacuum.
所以动词是“吸尘”。

87
And what is the noun, the thing we use?
我们用的名词是什么？

88
A vacuum cleaner.
吸尘器。

89
A vacuum cleaner, or just simply a vacuum.
吸尘器，或者简单地说是吸尘。

90
Now this is something that uses air to suck up all of the dirt and garbage.
这是一种使用空气吸走所有污垢和垃圾的工具。

91
So it goes and it sucks up all of that bad stuff.
所以它去吸走所有那些坏东西。

92
And so we don't have to dust it.
所以我们不需要擦拭它。

93
And obviously with carpet, we can't really use water.
显然对于地毯，我们不能真的用水。

94
So this is a great tool for cleaning fabric like carpets and rugs.
所以这是一个很好的工具，用于清洁像地毯和地垫这样的织物。

95
Very good.
非常好。

96
So that's all the ways that we can basically, the verbs that we use to clean around the house.
所以这就是我们基本上用来清理房子的动词。

97
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.
让我们再听一次对话，我们稍后会回来。

125
It's not really a pigsty.
其实不是猪圈。

126
There are no pigs living there.
里面没有猪。

127
But to say that a room is like a pigsty means that it's very, very, very dirty.
但说一个房间像猪圈意味着它非常非常脏。

128
Right, that it looks almost like the mud and the dirty place where pigs live.
对，几乎看起来像猪住的泥土和肮脏的地方。

129
Exactly.
正是如此。

130
So he's saying you're living in a dirty room.
所以他在说你住在一个脏房间里。

131
You need to clean this.
你需要清理这个。

132
Right, so a room or a house will look like a pigsty.

133
Now, the dad is actually making him do a lot of work because he says the kid is grounded.

134
You're grounded.
你被禁足了。

135
You're not allowed to play video games.

142
But to say you're grounded means you're being punished for something.

143
Right.

144
So the verb is to ground and you can also be grounded.
所以动词是禁足，你也可以被禁足。

如果你被禁足，你可以说，我很抱歉，我今天不能出去。

嗯，你想想，如果你不在努力，别人就会在努力，这意味着他们做的工作比他们应该做的多。

156
Right.
对。

157
So you're basically being asked to do your part, to be responsible for yourself, so that other people like your mom and dad don't have to be responsible for you.
所以你基本上被要求做你该做的部分，为自己负责，这样其他人，比如你的父母就不必为你负责。

158
Right.
对。

159

所以你必须帮助和合作。

160
Exactly.

161
So say there's three people, mom, dad, and a son.
假设有三个人，妈妈，爸爸和儿子。

162
If mom does all the cleaning, all the cooking, all the washing, then the other two, they're not pulling their weight.

而且你被禁足了。

180
You're not allowed to play video games.
你不允许玩电子游戏。

181
I want you to make your bed, do the laundry, and then come downstairs and sweep the floors.
我希望你整理床铺，洗衣服，然后下来扫地。

182
That's so unfair.
这太不公平了。

183
You have to pull your weight around here, young man.
你必须在这里尽自己的责任，年轻人。

184
My house, my rules.
我家，我的规则。

185
But I already mopped the floors, dusted the furniture, and vacuumed the rugs.
但我已经拖过地，擦过家具，还吸尘了。

186
That's great, but you still have work to do, so get to it.
很好，但你还有工作要做，所以快去做吧。

187
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

188
So doing household chores, not a fun thing, but also being grounded.
所以做家务并不是一件有趣的事，但被禁足也是。

189
Why do we consider chores to be kind of like a punishment?
为什么我们认为家务有点像惩罚？

190
Well, there's punishment where you sit alone in your room and you think about your actions, and then there's punishment that's more proactive.
嗯，有一种惩罚是你独自坐在房间里思考自己的行为，还有一种惩罚是更积极的。

191
Right.
对。

192
Mom and dad say, okay, well, he's grounded.
妈妈和爸爸说，好吧，他被禁足了。

193
Let's have him work.

194
Let's make him do something.
让他做点事情。

195
Let's make him do something so that we're benefiting from his punishment.
让他做点事情，这样我们就能从他的惩罚中受益。

196
I think it's also good when children are grounded because it makes them realize that they need to help out around the house, that it's this work.
我认为孩子被禁足也是好的，因为这让他们意识到他们需要在家里帮忙，这是一项工作。

197
It doesn't get done magically.
这不是神奇完成的。

198
There's actually someone doing it.
实际上是有人在做。

199
Right.
对。

200
And it's not like, well, in many cases, in many countries, people will have, like we saw in our previous lesson, a domestic maid, a cleaning lady, that will usually do everything.
而且并不是说，在很多情况下，在很多国家，人们会像我们在之前的课程中看到的那样，有一个家政女佣，清洁工，通常会做所有事情。

201
So maybe the kid will become very comfortable and not really do anything.
所以也许孩子会变得非常懒惰，什么都不做。

202
We're very lazy.
我们非常懒惰。

203
Very lazy.
非常懒惰。

204
Even worse.
更糟糕。

205
Yeah.
是的。

206
So I definitely remember in my house, we had chores because when it's not punishment, when it's your parents' expectation normally, that's called a chore.
所以我确实记得在我家，我们有家务，因为当这不是惩罚，而是父母的期望时，这被称为家务。

207
Right.
对。

208
And they say, okay, Catherine, your chores this week, you need to take the garbage outside, you need to wash the dishes, and you need to make your bed every day.
他们说，好吧，凯瑟琳，你这周的家务是，你需要把垃圾拿出去，你需要洗碗，每天需要整理床铺。

209
Right.
对。

210
And then maybe my brother had to help cook and clean the floor, mop the floors and sweep.
然后也许我哥哥需要帮忙做饭和清扫地板，拖地和扫地。

211
So we have different chores.
所以我们有不同的家务。

212
Right.
对。

213
And I guess this is more common, especially if both parents work, and everyone is collaborating or pulling their weight in the house.
我想这在双方父母都工作时更为常见，每个人都在家里合作或尽自己的一份力。

214
And if you don't have a cleaning lady, for example.
如果你没有清洁工的话，例如。

215
Very interesting topic.
非常有趣的话题。

216
Well, that's all the time we have for today.
好吧，今天的时间就到这里。
