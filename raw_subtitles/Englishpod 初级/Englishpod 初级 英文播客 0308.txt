That's right, but very necessary to learn in English because it's very, very useful.
没错，但这是学习英语中非常必要的，因为它非常有用。

7
That's right.

So we're talking about clothing, more specifically underwear.
所以我们要谈论的是服装，更具体地说是内衣。

So the clothes you wear under your clothes.
就是你穿在衣服下面的衣物。

That's right.
没错。

11
Okay, so let's just jump into the dialogue.
好的，那我们就直接进入对话吧。

Let's see what happens today.

15
so a lot of great vocab there.
所以这里有很多很棒的词汇。

16
Let's take a look at that now on Language Takeaway.
现在让我们在Language Takeaway中看看这些。

17
So the first thing we have here in Language Takeaway is actually very interesting, Marco, because we don't say one underwear or one boxers.
在Language Takeaway中，我们首先看到的非常有趣，Marco，因为我们不说一条内裤或一条 boxer。

18
We say a pair of.
我们说一对。

19
Just like pants.
就像裤子一样。

20
A pair of pants or a pair of underwear.
一条裤子或一条内裤。

21
A pair of pants, a pair of shorts, of socks.
一条裤子，一条短裤，一双袜子。

22
The same thing goes for underwear, so I really don't know why because it's one piece.
内衣也是如此，所以我真的不知道为什么，因为它是一件。

23
So are pants, but basically you have two holes, two places for your legs.
裤子也是如此，但基本上你有两个洞，两个放腿的地方。

24
So anything with your legs, your socks, your shoes, your pants, your underwear, we say a pair because you've got the both sides, left and right.
所以任何与腿有关的东西，比如袜子、鞋子、裤子、内衣，我们都说一对，因为你有左右两边。

25
Okay.
好的。

26
Alright, so you've got a pair of men's boxers.
好的，所以你有一条男士内裤。

27
Now, before we describe the underwear part, let's take a look at this other machine, a laundry machine.
现在，在我们描述内衣部分之前，让我们看看这台洗衣机。

28
Okay, so you know what a machine is.
好的，你知道什么是机器。

29
It's usually something that uses electricity to help us with a task or a job, but a laundry machine is special because it helps us clean our laundry.
通常是使用电力来帮助我们完成某项任务或工作，但洗衣机是特别的，因为它帮助我们清洗衣物。

30
What kind of things are laundry?
什么东西算是洗衣物？

31
So anything that's your clothes.
所有你的衣服。

32
So basically it's also called a washing machine.
所以基本上它也被称为洗衣机。

33
Right?
对吧？

34
So laundry machine or washing machine, same thing.
所以洗衣机或洗衣机，都是一样的。

35
It uses water and soap to wash your clothes.
它使用水和肥皂来洗你的衣服。

36
That's right.
没错。

37
Okay, so now let's get into the type of underwear here, specifically for men.
好的，现在让我们进入这里的内衣类型，特别是男士内衣。

38
Usually we have boxers, boxer shorts.
通常我们有 boxer，短裤。

39
That's right.
没错。

40
So shorts means that they're not long, they're short, but boxers, or boxer shorts as you say, are usually pretty loose.
短裤意味着它们不长，它们是短的，但 boxer，或者你说的 boxer 短裤，通常是比较宽松的。

41
They're not very tight, and they're longer than the other kinds of underwear we have.
它们不太紧，而且比我们其他种类的内衣要长。

42
Okay, so boxers are a type of underwear that men wear under their clothes, and as you say, they're pretty much shorts.
好的，所以 boxer 是男士穿在衣服下面的一种内衣，正如你所说，它们基本上就是短裤。

43
But they're called boxers, or you can call them boxer shorts.
但它们被称为 boxer，或者你可以称它们为 boxer 短裤。

44
Now, I guess the classic or the common form of these are smaller than boxers, and they're tighter, and they are usually made out of some kind of material that stretches.
现在，我想经典或常见的形式比 boxer 小，而且更紧，通常由某种弹性材料制成。

45
You can pull them a little bit.
你可以稍微拉一下。

46
And this is, this is again, a smaller version, well, a smaller kind of underwear.
这又是一个更小的版本，嗯，更小的一种内衣。

47
That's right.
没错。

48
So boxers are more like shorts.
所以 boxer 更像短裤。

49
Briefs are kind of, and briefs are not really shorts.
内裤有点，内裤并不是真正的短裤。

50
They're more like a, I guess kind of like a swimming suit, they look like.
它们更像，我想有点像游泳衣，看起来像。

51
Yeah, like a bathing suit bottom for men.
是的，像男士的泳裤底部。

52
Okay, now, that's it, right?
好的，现在就这样，对吧？

53
Okay, undies.
好的，内裤。

54
Okay, so both these things we could actually describe as undies.
好的，所以这两种东西我们实际上可以称为内裤。

55
That's right, so undies is a common spoken language way of saying underwear.
没错，所以内裤是口语中常用的说法。

56
Okay, so it's very casual, and it's usually something that we say with our family or friends, especially moms like to say this with their kids.
好的，所以这非常随意，通常是我们与家人或朋友说的，尤其是妈妈喜欢和孩子说这个。

57
Undies.
内裤。

58
Alright, honey, I'm going to buy you some new undies this week, and of course, as a child, you feel very embarrassed, but undies is a way to say underwear.

Some people say they're called tighty whities.
有些人说它们叫紧身白裤。

This is usually something we say to joke, because in America, at least many men like to wear... young men like to wear boxers.

所以这个随意的名字，这不是你想对你的英语老师说的，随意的或搞笑的名字是紧身白裤。

144
And actually this is very interesting, because with newer generations, I think, men are wearing boxers instead of briefs.
实际上这很有趣，因为随着新一代的到来，我认为，男人开始穿平角裤而不是三角裤。

145
Before, I think the only option was briefs.
以前，我认为唯一的选择是三角裤。

146
But now boxers have grown more and more popular, and I think when you're a little kid, your mom always buys you little briefs and everything, but then when you're a teenager, I think you just switch over to boxers.
但现在平角裤越来越流行，我认为当你还是小孩时，你的妈妈总是给你买小三角裤，但当你是青少年时，我认为你就会转向平角裤。

147
It's not as cool anymore to wear briefs.

148
Yeah, I think it's the whole fact of how kids sometimes dress with saggy or baggy pants, and so they like to show their boxers underneath, for some reason.
是的，我认为这与孩子们有时穿着松垮的裤子有关，他们喜欢把平角裤露在外面，不知为何。
