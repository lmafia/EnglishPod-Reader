8
Well, that's the thing.

9
In every country in the world, now they are becoming more strict on smoking and where you can smoke, so it's becoming very difficult for smokers nowadays.
在世界上的每个国家，现在对吸烟和吸烟的地方变得越来越严格，所以现在吸烟者变得非常困难。

10

嗯，这是想戒烟的一个好理由。

11
And that's what we're going to be talking about today, is quitting smoking.
而我们今天要谈的就是戒烟。

12
Well, before we get going, we do have a really important phrase that we should preview in today's vocabulary preview.

69
So Marco, maybe we should talk about how cutting down and quitting are different.

70
All right.

71

186
Alright.
好吧。

187
So you can use this phrase for different habits, different things that you do, like drinking, for example, or cutting down on sugar.
所以你可以把这个短语用于不同的习惯，做的不同事情，比如饮酒，或者减少糖的摄入。

188
But generally, we just say this about cigarettes.
但通常我们只是说这与香烟有关。

189
So it's mostly related to smoking.
所以它主要与吸烟有关。

So they say, no more smoking in public places, no more smoking in restaurants, no more smoking in bars.

204
Example one.
例子一。

205
