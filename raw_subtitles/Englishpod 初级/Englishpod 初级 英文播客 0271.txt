22
It has been three years since I visited Beijing, and it's clear to me that operations here are obviously going from strength to strength.
自从我三年前访问北京以来，这里显然在不断发展壮大。

23
The Alpha brand continues to grow in leaps and bounds in China, and that is certainly down to the hard work of all of you here.

24
So congratulations to all of you.
所以祝贺大家。

25
I'd like to start by outlining the key points of my presentation this afternoon and giving you an idea of the topics that will be discussed.
我想先概述一下我今天下午演示的关键点，并给你们一个将要讨论的主题的概念。

26
The presentation today is divided into five main parts.
今天的演示分为五个主要部分。

27
First of all, I'd like to briefly touch on the background of the new X420 line, how the whole concept has come about, and how the new product fits into our existing brand line.
首先，我想简要介绍一下新X420系列的背景，这个概念是如何产生的，以及新产品如何融入我们现有的品牌系列。

28
Secondly, I'd like to present data on projected sales for the X420.
其次，我想展示X420的预计销售数据。

29
We will then go on to discuss our key rivals in this sector.
然后我们将讨论这个领域的主要竞争对手。

30
Then I'd like to go on to outline the campaign concept for the X420.
接着我想概述一下X420的营销活动概念。

31
Finally, I'm happy to open up the discussion for any questions or points you may have for me.
最后，我很高兴为大家提供讨论的机会，回答你们可能有的问题或意见。

32
All right, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

33
So as you can see, it's the very beginning of a presentation.
如你所见，这是演示的开始部分。

34
We're kind of starting to give people an idea of what we're going to talk about.
我们开始给人们一个我们将要讨论的内容的概念。

35
So let's take a look at some of the language Mr. Ford used on language takeaway.
让我们看看Ford先生使用的一些语言。

36
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

37
So the reason Mr. Ford is giving a presentation is because he wants to talk about their, the company's new line of computers, right?
Ford先生进行演示的原因是他想谈论公司的新电脑系列，对吧？

38
And so he says that they're going to launch a new line of desktop and laptop computers.
所以他说他们将推出一条新的台式和笔记本电脑系列。

39
That's right.
没错。

40
So they want to launch a new line of laptops.
所以他们想推出一条新的笔记本电脑系列。

41
So this verb to launch means to bring out to the market.
这个动词“推出”意味着将产品推向市场。

42
That's right.
没错。

43
So instead of the word to start, which you could use in many different ways, like to start eating or to start swimming, in this case, to launch means you're going to introduce a new product to the market, like you said, Marco.
所以与“开始”这个词相比，虽然“开始”可以用在很多不同的场合，比如“开始吃”或“开始游泳”，在这种情况下，“推出”意味着你将向市场介绍一个新产品，就像你说的，Marco。

44
That's right.
没错。

45
We are going to start selling to the market a new product.
我们将开始向市场销售一个新产品。

46
We're going to launch a new line of laptop and desktop computers.
我们将推出一条新的笔记本和台式电脑系列。

47
For example, this spring, Steve Jobs launched the iPad, which is a new product.
例如，今年春天，Steve Jobs推出了iPad，这是一个新产品。

48
That's right.
没错。

49
So he launched the iPad and the iPhone 4.
所以他推出了iPad和iPhone 4。

50
They're always launching new things at Apple.
他们总是在Apple推出新产品。

51
That's right.
没错。

52
All right.
好的。

53
So since they're launching this new line of laptop and desktop computers, Mr. Ford first wanted to give a brief overview of the marketing campaign.
所以由于他们推出这条新的笔记本和台式电脑系列，Ford先生首先想简要介绍一下市场营销活动。

54
Okay.
好的。

55
So first of all, we're going to talk about how this product is being marketed.
所以首先，我们将讨论这个产品是如何被营销的。

56
So you want to give a general picture or a very simple picture of what's going to happen.
所以你想给出一个大致的或非常简单的情况，说明将会发生什么。

57
So at the beginning, this will happen.
所以一开始，这将发生。

58
Then this will happen.
然后这将发生。

59
At the end, this will happen.
最后，这将发生。

60
And that's what we call an overview.
这就是我们所说的概述。

61
That's right.
没错。

62
So it's a brief or general idea of what we're talking about, an overview.
所以这是我们讨论的简要或一般想法，一个概述。

63
Nothing too specific.
没有太具体的内容。

64
We just want to give you a general idea.
我们只是想给你一个大致的想法。

65
That's right.
没错。

66
After that, Mr. Ford starts talking and he's talking about the presentation, which has many parts, and he wants to talk about what each part will contain.
之后，Ford先生开始谈论演示，它有很多部分，他想谈论每个部分将包含什么。

67
So he says, I'd like to briefly touch on the background of the new X420 line.
所以他说，我想简要介绍一下新X420系列的背景。

68
So this verb, to touch on.
所以这个动词“提及”。

69
What does this mean?
这是什么意思？

70
Okay.
好的。

71
So when he says he wants to touch on the background of this new computer, he's basically saying, I want to talk about.
所以当他说他想提及这个新电脑的背景时，他基本上是在说，我想谈论。

72
Alright, so this is potentially very confusing because we know the word to touch means to put your hand on something.
好的，这可能会非常混淆，因为我们知道“触碰”这个词意味着把手放在某物上。

73
But to touch on, this is a phrasal verb, this means to talk about or to address.
但“提及”是一个短语动词，意味着谈论或涉及。

74
That's right.
没错。

75
So for example, a teacher at a university will touch on many topics during his lecture.
例如，大学的老师在讲座中会提及许多主题。

76
That's right.
没错。

77
Or I'd like to touch on where we're going to dinner tonight because I'm very hungry.
或者我想提及我们今晚要去哪里吃饭，因为我很饿。

78
Okay.
好的。

79
So basically it's a nice way of saying, I want to talk about this topic.
所以基本上这是一个很好的说法，表示我想谈论这个话题。

80
Okay.
好的。

81
And then apart from touching on the background of the new computer, he said he also wants to talk about projected sales for this new computer.
除了提及新电脑的背景外，他还说他想谈论这个新电脑的预计销售。

82
Okay.
好的。

83
So projected sales, this phrase includes two words.
所以“预计销售”这个短语包含两个词。

84
Sales means how much of something you sell, obviously, but projected means what you expect to sell.
“销售”意味着你卖出多少东西，显然，但“预计”意味着你期望销售多少。

85
So the projected sales have not happened yet.
所以预计销售尚未发生。

86
They will happen in the future.
它们将在未来发生。

87
And so they're basically my guess about sales.
所以它们基本上是我对销售的猜测。

88
That's right.
没错。

89
So basically we are giving an estimate of what we think we will sell.
所以基本上我们在给出我们认为会销售的估计。

90
Those are projected sales.
这就是预计销售。

91
We think we will sell a thousand computers.
我们认为我们将销售一千台电脑。

92
Those are our projected sales.
这就是我们的预计销售。

93
Right.
对。

94
And after that, we have one more key word.
然后我们还有一个关键词。

95
This word comes at the very end of the speech.
这个词出现在演讲的最后。

96
Mr. Ford says, we will then go on to discuss our key rivals.
Ford先生说，我们将继续讨论我们的主要竞争对手。

97
Now who is a rival, Marco?
现在谁是竞争对手，Marco？

98
Okay.
好的。

99
So a rival is basically your competitor or maybe kind of your enemy.
所以竞争对手基本上是你的竞争者，或者可能是你的敌人。

100
All right.
好的。

101
So in computers, who is Apple's rival?
在电脑领域，谁是苹果的竞争对手？

102
Maybe HP or IBM or Dell.
可能是惠普、IBM或戴尔。

103
Very good.
非常好。

104
So a rival is someone you compete with.
所以竞争对手是你竞争的对象。

105
That's right.
没错。

106
So he's going to talk about his key rivals.
他将谈论他的主要竞争对手。

107
So basically the word key is your most important rivals.
基本上，关键这个词是指你最重要的竞争对手。

108
All right.
好的。

109
So for example, who is one of Batman's key rivals?
比如，蝙蝠侠的一个主要竞争对手是谁？

110
Because we have rivals not just in business, but also in life.
因为我们在商业上不仅有竞争对手，在生活中也有。

111
That's right.
没错。

112
So for example, I think maybe Batman's key rival might be the Joker.
比如，我认为蝙蝠侠的主要竞争对手可能是小丑。

113
Or the Penguin.
或者企鹅人。

114
Or the Penguin.
或者企鹅人。

115
All right.
好的。

116
So let's take another listen to today's dialogue.
那么我们再听一遍今天的对话。

117
And we'll be back in a moment with some very important phrases.
我们稍后会带来一些非常重要的短语。

118
We have bounced back from the recession and now we are set to launch our new line of laptop and desktop computers.
我们已经从经济衰退中恢复过来，现在准备推出我们的新系列笔记本和台式电脑。
