Hey, Julie.

17
I don't eat meat, but that's fine.
我不吃肉，但没关系。

18
I'm sure wherever we're going they will have other options, right?
我相信我们去的地方会有其他选择，对吧？

19
I didn't know you were a vegetarian.

25
I don't wear leather, eat eggs, drink milk, or anything that comes from an animal.
我不穿皮革，不吃鸡蛋，不喝牛奶，也不吃任何来自动物的东西。

26
I used to be a pescatarian before, which basically means you don't eat meat, but still have fish and seafood.
我以前是海鲜素食者，基本上是指不吃肉，但仍然吃鱼和海鲜。

27
Wow.
哇。

28
That's interesting.
这很有趣。

29
It must be tough.
这一定很难。

30
It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian-friendly restaurants sometimes, but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays, it's getting a bit less difficult.
有时候找素食友好的餐厅有点困难，但由于现在越来越多的人是素食主义者或严格素食主义者，这变得稍微容易一些。

31
Alright, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

32
So now, probably a lot of you have an idea of what it means to be a vegetarian, but let's take a look at that word and many more on language takeaway.
现在，可能很多人对素食主义者的意思有了了解，但让我们看看这个词和更多的语言要点。

33
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

34
So, a vegetarian is a noun.
所以，素食主义者是一个名词。

35
I am a vegetarian.
我是素食主义者。

36
Yeah.
是的。

37
Vegetarian is a noun.
素食主义者是一个名词。

38
It's a person.
是一个人。

39
You say, I am a vegetarian.
你说，我是素食主义者。

40
He is a vegetarian.
他是素食主义者。

41
And in this case, a vegetarian person does not eat meat.
在这种情况下，素食主义者不吃肉。

42
So, no chicken, no beef, none of that stuff.
所以，不吃鸡肉，不吃牛肉，没那些东西。

43
That's right.
没错。

44
So, as you can see, it has the prefix veget, like vegetable.
所以，正如你所看到的，它有前缀veget，像vegetable（蔬菜）。

45
So, that's what they eat.
所以，他们吃的就是这些。

46
They just eat vegetables.
他们只吃蔬菜。

47
And it's a little bit hard to say what all vegetarians do or don't eat because some people have different rules.
而且很难说所有素食主义者吃或不吃什么，因为有些人有不同的规则。

48
That's right.
没错。

49
Some people eat eggs, some people don't.
有些人吃鸡蛋，有些人不吃。

50
But there is something that is a little bit different from a vegetarian.
但有一种与素食主义者稍有不同的东西。

51
It's called a vegan.
它叫做严格素食主义者。

52
And this person has many, many rules about what he can or cannot eat.
这个人有很多关于他能吃或不能吃的规则。

53
Right.
对。

54
So, a vegetarian basically does not eat meat.
所以，素食主义者基本上不吃肉。

55
A vegan, as we saw in our dialogue, doesn't wear leather.
严格素食主义者，如我们在对话中看到的，不穿皮革。

56
For example, doesn't wear leather shoes or a jacket or use or eat anything that comes from an animal.
例如，不穿皮革鞋或夹克，也不使用或吃任何来自动物的东西。

57
That's right.
没错。

58
So, no eggs, right?
所以，不吃鸡蛋，对吧？

59
No foods that might have any animal products in them.
不吃可能含有任何动物产品的食物。

60
So, vegans often try to find foods at the grocery store that come from natural products that are not animal-based.
所以，严格素食主义者通常会在杂货店寻找来自非动物产品的天然食品。

61
And so, there has to be a symbol on the back of the box or the jar that says that it's vegan.
所以，盒子或罐子的背面必须有一个符号，表明它是严格素食的。

62
That's right.
没错。

63
So, in that case, they don't drink milk, they don't eat eggs.
所以，在这种情况下，他们不喝牛奶，不吃鸡蛋。

64
Nothing that you can think of that comes from an animal.
任何你能想到的来自动物的东西。

65
But on the other hand, this person used to be a pescatarian.
但另一方面，这个人以前是海鲜素食者。

66
So, this is another type of person that has a special diet, very much like a vegetarian.
所以，这是一种与素食主义者非常相似的特殊饮食类型。

67
A pescatarian is a person who is a vegetarian but who also eats fish.
海鲜素食者是一个素食主义者，但也吃鱼。

68
And so, maybe I'm a pescatarian because I don't consider fish to be animals.
所以，也许我是一名海鲜素食者，因为我不认为鱼是动物。

69
Okay.
好的。

70
So, I don't eat lamb, I don't eat chicken, but I do eat fish.
所以，我不吃羊肉，不吃鸡肉，但我吃鱼。

71
I'm a pescatarian.
我是海鲜素食者。

72
Alright.
好的。

73
So, a vegetarian does not eat fish or any type of meat, the same as a vegan.
所以，素食主义者不吃鱼或任何类型的肉，和严格素食主义者一样。

74
But a pescatarian does eat maybe shrimp and fish and any type of animal from the sea.
但海鲜素食者可能吃虾和鱼以及任何来自海洋的动物。

75
Okay.
好的。

76
And well, that brings us up to our next word.
那么，这就引出了我们的下一个词。

77
A pescatarian will eat seafood.
海鲜素食者会吃海鲜。

78
Seafood is a word we use to describe animals that come from the sea.
海鲜是我们用来描述来自海洋的动物的词。

79
So, not just fish.
所以，不仅仅是鱼。

80
Also, like you said, shrimp and lobster.
还有，正如你所说，虾和龙虾。

81
You could even think of really delicious food like a seafood pasta or a seafood salad, octopus, things like that.
你甚至可以想到像海鲜意大利面或海鲜沙拉、章鱼等美味食物。

82
Okay.
好的。

83
So, you got clams, you have oysters.
所以，你有蛤蜊，有牡蛎。

84
Anything that comes from the sea is considered seafood, right?
任何来自海洋的东西都被视为海鲜，对吧？

85
That's right.

86
And our last word and language takeaway is an adjective we heard at the end of the dialogue.
我们最后一个词和语言要点是我们在对话结束时听到的一个形容词。

87
Our character said, it must be tough.

121
Alright, now we've prepared three phrases for you.
好的，现在我们为你准备了三个短语。

122
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.
让我们现在在流利构建器上看看这些。

123
So there's a very interesting and very, very common phrase at the beginning of today's dialogue that we use all the time in English.
所以在今天对话的开头有一个非常有趣且非常常见的短语，我们在英语中经常使用。

124
This is to grab something to eat.
这是去吃点东西。

125
The character says, Hey, Julie, you want to go grab something to eat?
角色说，嘿，朱莉，你想去吃点东西吗？

126
So taking that as a phrase, we are inviting someone to go eat something.
所以把这个作为一个短语，我们是在邀请某人去吃东西。

127
That's right.
没错。

128
So I could say, Hey, do you want to go eat something?
所以我可以说，嘿，你想去吃点东西吗？

129
Or I could say, Hey, do you want to go grab something to eat?
或者我可以说，嘿，你想去吃点东西吗？

130
Okay, and the verb grab is to take or to hold in your hand.
好的，动词grab是拿或握在手中。

131
So you want to go grab something to eat is basically that.
所以你想去吃点东西基本上就是这个意思。

132
Right, but don't be confused because grabbing normally means holding with your hand.
对，但不要混淆，因为grab通常意味着用手握住。

133
But to grab something to eat generally just means, Hey, would you like to go eat something with me?
但去吃点东西通常只是意味着，嘿，你想和我一起去吃点东西吗？

134
Okay.
好的。

135
And of course, we want to go grab something to eat.
当然，我们想去吃点东西。

136
And the guy says, I really feel like having a big juicy steak.
然后那个男孩说，我真的想吃一块多汁的大牛排。

137
So we feel like having a steak.
所以我们想吃牛排。

138
This is very spoken English.
这很口语化的英语。

139
So remember when you're talking to your friends, this is okay, but maybe if you're writing something, it's not as good.
所以记住，当你和朋友交谈时，这样说是可以的，但如果你在写东西，可能就不太好。

140
But I feel like a steak means I want to eat a steak.
但我想吃牛排意味着我想吃牛排。

141
Right.
对。

142
It doesn't mean you are a steak.
这并不意味着你是牛排。

143
No, I don't feel like a steak, like a piece of meat, but I do want to eat a steak.
不，我不觉得自己像牛排，像一块肉，但我确实想吃牛排。

144
And so I feel like having or I feel like a steak.
所以我想吃或我想吃牛排。

145
These are both acceptable in spoken English.
这两种说法在口语英语中都是可以接受的。

146
So you basically feel like doing something or you feel like eating something.
所以你基本上是想做某事或想吃某事。

147
For example, if we're going to have dinner, you can say, I feel like having Italian food.
例如，如果我们要吃晚餐，你可以说，我想吃意大利菜。

148
Yeah, I don't feel like having Italian food tonight.
是的，我今晚不想吃意大利菜。

149
I feel like having Mexican food.
我想吃墨西哥菜。

150
And I also feel like watching a movie.
我也想看电影。

151
Exactly.
正是如此。

152
So great ways of using feel like and then a verb like having or watching a movie.
所以使用feel like和动词如having或watching a movie是很好的方式。

153
Now getting back to the vegetarian, the vegan aspect of our dialogue.
现在回到我们对话中的素食者和严格素食者的方面。

154
We saw that the girl explained how she doesn't eat or use any animal-based products.
我们看到女孩解释了她不吃或使用任何动物产品。

155
So these three words, animal-based products.
所以这三个词，动物产品。

156
So product is basically anything that will be sold or bought.
所以产品基本上是任何将被出售或购买的东西。

157
Animal-based is a way to describe a product.
动物产品是描述产品的一种方式。

158
So some products have animal products in them, right?
所以有些产品含有动物产品，对吧？

159
So, for example, my shoes are an animal-based product because they are leather and leather comes from cows, which are animals.
例如，我的鞋子是动物产品，因为它们是皮革，而皮革来自牛，牛是动物。

160
So you're basically saying that they have something from an animal.
所以你基本上是在说它们有来自动物的东西。

161
They are made up of something that comes from an animal like leather shoes.
它们是由来自动物的东西制成的，比如皮鞋。

162
Exactly.
正是如此。

163
And it's not just shoes.
不仅仅是鞋子。

164
It's also shampoo or some of the foods that you eat like in jars and cans.
还有洗发水或你吃的一些食物，比如罐装和瓶装的。

165
And so it's important if you're a vegan to look on the side of the can or the side of the box and see, is this an animal-based product?
所以如果你是严格素食者，查看罐子或盒子的侧面，看看这是否是动物产品是很重要的。

166
Are there animal products in this?
里面是否有动物产品？

167
Right, right.
对，对。

168
Okay.
好的。

169
A lot of interesting things in this dialogue today.
今天的对话中有很多有趣的事情。

170
Why don't we listen to it one last time and we'll be back.
我们再听一遍，然后再回来。

171
Hey, Julie, do you want to go grab something to eat?
嘿，朱莉，你想去吃点东西吗？

172
Sure.
当然。

173
What do you feel like having?
你想吃什么？

174
I really feel like having a big juicy steak.
我真的想吃一块多汁的大牛排。

175
Oh, okay.
哦，好吧。

176
I don't eat meat, but that's fine.
我不吃肉，但没关系。

177
I'm sure wherever we're going, they will have other options, right?
我相信我们去的地方会有其他选择，对吧？

178
I didn't know you were a vegetarian.
我不知道你是素食主义者。

179
I'm not.
我不是。

180
I'm a vegan.
我是严格素食者。

181
A what?
什么？

182
A vegan.
严格素食者。

183
I don't eat or use any animal-based products.
我不吃或使用任何动物产品。

184
I don't wear leather, eat eggs, drink milk, or anything that comes from an animal.
我不穿皮革，不吃鸡蛋，不喝牛奶，也不吃任何来自动物的东西。

185
I used to be a pescatarian before, which basically means you don't eat meat, but still have fish and seafood.
我以前是海鲜素食者，这基本上意味着你不吃肉，但仍然吃鱼和海鲜。

186
Wow, that's interesting.
哇，真有趣。

187
It must be tough.
这一定很难。

188
It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian-friendly restaurants sometimes, but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays, it's getting a bit less difficult.
有时找到适合素食者的餐厅有点困难，但由于现在越来越多的人是素食者或严格素食者，这变得稍微容易一些。

189
Alright, so talking about vegan vegetarians, pescatarians, it seems like these diets or these lifestyles are more and more popular, but as we saw in the dialogue, it can be a little bit difficult, especially maybe in countries where it's not so popular to have these diets.
好的，所以谈到严格素食者、素食者、海鲜素食者，这些饮食或生活方式似乎越来越流行，但正如我们在对话中看到的，这可能有点困难，尤其是在这些饮食不太流行的国家。

190
Definitely.
绝对是。

191
I think that in places where you can find vegan and vegetarian products very easily, being a vegetarian becomes much more easy because you have more options.
我认为在可以很容易找到严格素食和素食产品的地方，成为素食者变得更容易，因为你有更多的选择。

192
But if you're living in a country where it's very hard to eat a meal without having meat, then you might just eat potatoes every day, and that will get very, very difficult and very boring.
但如果你生活在一个很难吃到没有肉的餐点的国家，那么你可能每天只吃土豆，这会变得非常困难和无聊。

193
Well, that's one of the main arguments or the main concerns with people is that even though you can argue that you can get all the vitamins or many of the vitamins and minerals from nuts and from vegetables, it's still not healthy to completely exclude from your diet, maybe sources of proteins like meat or eggs or dairy products.
嗯，这就是人们主要担心的一个论点或主要问题，即使你可以争辩说你可以从坚果和蔬菜中获得所有或许多维生素和矿物质，但完全排除饮食中可能的蛋白质来源，如肉、鸡蛋或乳制品，仍然是不健康的。

194
That's right, and so in America, for example, it's very easy to find supplements.
没错，所以在美国，例如，很容易找到补充品。

195
You can take vitamins like calcium, and you can have pills that will give you some protein, and you can find all sorts of exotic vegetables that will help you supplement your diet.
你可以服用钙等维生素，你可以有一些提供蛋白质的药丸，你可以找到各种各样的异国蔬菜来补充你的饮食。

196
But in a place like China, for example, I think it can be a lot harder to find those products and to find those supplements, and so being a vegan especially or a vegetarian poses a lot more challenges.
但在像中国这样的地方，我认为找到这些产品和补充剂会困难得多，因此成为素食者尤其是素食者面临更多挑战。

197
Especially, I think, with what you mentioned that products are usually labeled, where they tell you if they have any animal-based products in there, whereas in other countries, it's probably not labeled, and it's a little bit... Even things like getting the fat-free things are a little bit more difficult in other countries like, for example, China.
尤其是，我认为你提到的产品通常会标明是否含有任何动物成分，而在其他国家，可能没有标明，这有点……甚至像无脂肪的东西在其他国家，比如中国，都会更难获得。

198
That's right.
没错。

199
So, we would like to know, are there many vegans or vegetarians in your country?
所以，我们想知道，你们国家有很多素食者或素食者吗？

200
And if there are, do you think it's hard for them to buy food?
如果有，你认为他们买食物困难吗？

201
Why or why not?
为什么或为什么不？

202
Let us know.
让我们知道。

203
