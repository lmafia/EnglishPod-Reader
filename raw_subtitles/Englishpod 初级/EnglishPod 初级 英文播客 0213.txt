So we have a lot of words that are related to all the preparations for when somebody dies and also some phrases that you can say to someone that maybe had a family member who recently passed away.
我们有很多与准备丧礼相关的词汇，还有一些可以对刚失去家人的人说的短语。

8
So before we get into all of this, we have a key word that we want to take a look at now in Vocabulary Preview.

48
Well, a plot, P-L-O-T, plot is a piece of land.

So you can think about this logically, a burial plot, burial to Bury is a place, a space in the ground where we Bury a person.

50
Usually you buy one of these at a cemetery, right?

Well, moving on a new trend, I would say, and many countries and many people around the world don't want to be buried.

68
So what happens you get cremated?

在一些国家，比如中国，我认为你不能被埋葬，必须火化，因为空间问题。

And well, as you said, you take the ashes, and you can put them in a cremation urn or just an urn.

81
Okay, urn, this might sound like a strange word to you.
好吧，骨灰盒，这可能对你来说是个奇怪的词。

82
But an urn is a special kind of pot, okay, or a vessel to hold things in.
但骨灰盒是一种特殊的容器，好的，或一个盛放东西的器皿。

83
So for example, in this case, we have a cremation urn that is a special pot, usually very beautiful.

90
Okay, so many people want to know what's the difference between a funeral and a memorial service, right?
好的，很多人想知道丧礼和追悼会之间的区别，对吧？

91
In my mind, a funeral is very quiet and sad, and you have some respectful words, and you usually put the casket into the ground or have some kind of ceremony.
在我看来，丧礼是非常安静和悲伤的，你会有一些尊重的话，通常会把棺材放入地下或举行某种仪式。

92
But a memorial service is an opportunity to talk to friends and family to eat some food to have some drinks to talk about the person who died.
但追悼会是一个与朋友和家人交谈的机会，可以吃一些食物，喝一些饮料，谈论去世的人。

93
It's almost like the party if that makes sense.

94
Yeah, exactly.

It's a it's a get together of people who obviously are trying to give support to their friends or their family members who lost that person, but also to talk about that person in a good way and all the great memories they had.
这是一个聚会，显然是为了支持失去那个人的朋友或家人，但也是为了以好的方式谈论那个人和他们的美好回忆。
