My name is Marco.

And my name is Catherine.
我叫Catherine。

4
And in the spirit of Halloween, we have a Halloween lesson for you.
在万圣节的精神下，我们为你准备了一节万圣节课程。

5
Happy Halloween... it's Halloween.
万圣节快乐……今天是万圣节。

6
It's Halloween.
今天是万圣节。

7
And this is an elementary level lesson, so we're talking about some basic but important things today.
这是一个初级水平的课程，所以我们今天会谈一些基本但重要的事情。

8
Exactly.
没错。

9
So we're not gonna preview anything because the dialogue is pretty simple.
我们不会预览任何内容，因为对话相当简单。

10
So why don't we listen to it for the first time, and we'll be right back.
那我们先听一次对话，然后马上回来。

11
Trick-or-treat!
不给糖就捣蛋！

12
Tom, aren't you a little too old to be trick-or-treating?
Tom，你难道不觉得你有点太大了，不适合去要糖吗？

13
What are you talking about?
你在说什么？

14
Where's your Halloween spirit?
你的万圣节精神在哪里？

15
Didn't you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends?
你难道从来没有穿上服装和朋友们一起在邻里要糖吗？

16
Of course I did, but when I was ten, trick-or-treating is for kids.
当然有，但我十岁的时候，给糖是小孩的事。

17
Plus, I'm sure people will think you're a kidnapper or something, running around with kids at night.
而且，我敢肯定人们会觉得你是个绑架者，晚上和小孩一起跑来跑去。

18
Whatever.
随便。

19
I'm going next door.
我去隔壁。

20
I heard Mrs. Robinson is giving out big bags of M&M's.
我听说Robinson太太在发大袋的M&M。

21
Alright, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

22
So, trick-or-treating.
所以，给糖。

23
Ding-dong.
丁当。

24
Ding-dong.
丁当。

25
Trick-or-treat.
不给糖就捣蛋。

26
Alright, so we're gonna explain what trick-or-treating is just in a little bit, but before we get into it, why don't we take a look at four important words in language takeaway.
好的，我们稍后会解释什么是给糖，但在此之前，我们先来看四个重要的语言要点。

27
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

28
Well, the first one, Marco, is very important because it's the name of this special holiday that isn't celebrated everywhere.
第一个，Marco，非常重要，因为这是一个并不是在所有地方庆祝的特殊节日的名字。

29
It's only celebrated in some places, and Americans, I think, love it above all else.
只有一些地方庆祝，我认为美国人最喜欢这个节日。

30
Right, yeah.
对，没错。

31
Halloween.
万圣节。

32
Now, this actually comes from All Hallows' Eve, right?
这个实际上来自“万圣节前夕”，对吗？

33
That's right.
没错。

34
So, it's the night of the spirits of the dead.
所以，这是死者灵魂的夜晚。

35
Right, exactly.
对，正是。

36
So, the Day of the Dead.
所以，亡灵节。

37
And as Catherine mentions, it's celebrated in different ways in different countries, but I think probably the United States is one of the few where people dress up and go trick-or-treating.
正如Catherine提到的，它在不同国家以不同方式庆祝，但我认为美国是少数几个会穿上服装去要糖的地方之一。

38
That's right.
没错。

39
And Halloween is the last day of October, so October 31st, and it's a really fun holiday where mostly children dress up in costumes and they ask for candy.
万圣节是十月的最后一天，也就是10月31日，这是一个非常有趣的节日，主要是孩子们穿上服装，向人们要糖。

40
Alright, so to dress up means to get in a costume.
好的，穿上服装意味着穿上服装。

41
Right, well, you could say dress up to mean a couple of different things, but in this case, you dress up in a costume.
对，你可以说“穿上服装”有几种不同的意思，但在这种情况下，你是穿上服装。

42
So, that means you change your clothes so that you're wearing a costume, which is maybe a witch's costume or a vampire or something scary.
这意味着你换上衣服，穿上可能是女巫的服装、吸血鬼或其他可怕的东西。

43
So, you would say, he dressed up as a vampire.
所以，你可以说，他打扮成吸血鬼。

44
He dressed up as a vampire or they got dressed up for the wedding.
他打扮成吸血鬼，或者他们为婚礼打扮。

45
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

46
So, dress up.
所以，穿上服装。

47
And then we have the word kidnapper.
然后我们有“绑架者”这个词。

48
So, the friend is afraid that his friend will look like a kidnapper if he goes out trick-or-treating with the kids.
所以，朋友担心他的朋友如果和孩子们一起去要糖会看起来像个绑架者。

49
Right.
对。

50
And so, a kidnapper comes from the word to take or to grab.
所以，绑架者这个词来自于“带走”或“抓住”。

51
So, kid grabber.
所以，绑架者。

52
And that means that you're going to take children from the streets and steal them.
这意味着你会从街上带走孩子并偷走他们。

53
Right.
对。

54
But you can kidnap an adult, right?
但你也可以绑架成年人，对吗？

55
So, it's not only for kids.
所以，这不仅仅是针对孩子。

56
That's right.
没错。

57
It's for any kind of person who you take without them wanting you to.
这是针对任何你在他们不想的情况下带走的人。

58
So, against their will.
所以，违背他们的意愿。

59
Okay, kidnapper.
好的，绑架者。

60
And finally, we have M&M's.
最后，我们有M&M。

61
What are M&M's?
M&M是什么？

62
Not the singer, right?
不是那个歌手，对吧？

63
No, M&M is spelled differently, the singer.
不，M&M的拼写不同，那个歌手。

64
This is a delicious chocolate treat.
这是美味的巧克力零食。

65
It's a candy.
这是一种糖果。

66
And it comes in big brown bags.
它装在大棕色袋子里。

67
And if you want them with peanuts, they come in a yellow bag.
如果你想要带花生的，它们装在黄色袋子里。

68
You know your M&M's.
你对M&M很了解。

69
Oh man, I could tell you all the colors.
哦，我可以告诉你所有颜色。

70
But M&M's are really delicious.
但M&M真的很好吃。

71
And it's actually a brand, M&M's.
其实这是一个品牌，M&M。

72
It's a brand.
这是一个品牌。

73
Right, so many people probably know it.
对，所以很多人可能都知道它。

74
But, just in case, they're called M&M's.
但以防万一，它们叫做M&M。

75
Very good candy.
非常好的糖果。

76
Alright, so these words were relatively easy and simple.
好的，这些词相对简单易懂。

77
So, why don't we listen to our dialogue again.
那我们再听一次对话吧。

78
Let's slow it down just a little bit.
我们慢一点。

79
And we'll be right back to take a look at Fluency Builder.
然后我们会回来看看流利度提升。

80
Alright, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

81
So, on Fluency Builder, we promised that we were going to look at this word trick-or-treating.
在流利度提升中，我们承诺要看看这个词“给糖”。

82
So, let's look at it now.
那我们现在来看一下。

83
Trick-or-treat.
不给糖就捣蛋。

84
It's a verb, right?
这是一个动词，对吗？

85
To trick-or-treat.
给糖。

86
To trick-or-treat.
给糖。

87
And it comes from the words that we say when we're children to the person whose door we knock on.
这来自于我们小时候对敲门的人说的话。

88
So, for example, I say...
比如，我说……

89
And then I open the door?
然后我开门？

90
I say, trick-or-treat.
我说，不给糖就捣蛋。

91
Okay, so what are you supposed to do in this when somebody says trick-or-treat?
好的，那当有人说不给糖就捣蛋时你应该怎么做？

92
Well, I'm a child.
嗯，我是个孩子。

93
I'm holding my bag and you're supposed to say, happy Halloween, and give me some candy.
我拿着我的袋子，你应该说，万圣节快乐，给我一些糖。

94
Okay.
好的。

95
Alright, so trick-or-treat means you could either trick someone, you could play a trick on them, like scare them or put some toilet paper on their house, or you can give them a treat.
好的，所以不给糖就捣蛋意味着你可以捉弄某人，你可以给他们开个玩笑，比如吓唬他们或在他们的房子上放卫生纸，或者你可以给他们一个糖果。

96
Or accept a treat.
或者接受一个糖果。

97
And so, the idea is if you don't give me a treat, I will do something bad to you.
所以，想法是如果你不给我糖，我就会对你做一些坏事。

98
I see.
我明白了。

99
But this doesn't really happen, right?
但这并不是真的发生，对吧？

100
Like, when kids go to people's houses, they say trick-or-treat and then they get candy automatically.
就像，当孩子们去别人家时，他们说不给糖就捣蛋，然后他们就自动得到糖。

101
Almost automatically, yeah.
几乎是自动的，是的。

102
Sometimes people avoid the holiday, and they close their doors and lock them, and they don't answer the door.
有时人们会避开这个节日，关上门并锁上，不开门。

103
Yeah.
是的。

104
And that's when someone maybe throws an egg at the house.
然后可能有人会向房子扔鸡蛋。

105
Or puts toilet paper on their tree.
或者在他们的树上放卫生纸。

106
Yeah, so trick-or-treat is what we say, but it's also something we can do.
是的，所以“不给糖就捣蛋”是我们说的，但这也是我们可以做的事情。

107
So we can go trick-or-treating.
所以我们可以去“不给糖就捣蛋”。

108
Go trick-or-treating.
去“不给糖就捣蛋”。

109
Right, okay.
对，好的。

110
Very good.
非常好。

111
Trick-or-treat.
“不给糖就捣蛋”。

112
And now we have another phrase here that's a little bit complicated, but when the friend answered the door, he said, aren't you a little too old to be trick-or-treating?
现在我们有另一个短语，有点复杂，但当朋友开门时，他说，你是不是有点太大了，不适合“不给糖就捣蛋”？

113
Alright, I like this phrase because it's sarcastic.
好吧，我喜欢这个短语，因为它是讽刺的。

114
The person is not asking a real question.
这个人并不是在问一个真正的问题。

115
He's saying, listen, you are too old to be trick-or-treating.
他在说，听着，你太大了，不适合“不给糖就捣蛋”。

116
And so, in this case, aren't you... is a way to introduce something that we know is true, that we think is true.
所以，在这种情况下，“你不是...”是引入我们知道的真实情况的方式，我们认为是真的。

117
It's kind of rude and sarcastic.
这有点无礼和讽刺。

118
So if I say, aren't you supposed to be at work?
所以如果我说，你不是应该在工作吗？

119
Oh, shoot.
哦，糟糕。

120
So it's in that form.
所以是这种形式。

121
You're not really asking a question.
你并不是在真正问一个问题。

122
You're more demanding an explanation.
你更像是在要求一个解释。

123
Right, it's a suggestion.
对，这是一种建议。

124
It's like, you're probably supposed to be at work right now.
就像，你现在可能应该在工作。

125
Right, right.
对，对。

126
So Marco, aren't you supposed to be at school right now?
所以马尔科，你现在不是应该在学校吗？

127
So do we always, but we always use it in that sense, right?
所以我们总是这样用，对吧？

128
Aren't you, and then... Yeah, aren't you, mm-hmm-hmm, aren't you a little old for that kind of an outfit?
你不是，然后... 是的，你不是，嗯哼，嗯，你是不是有点太大了，不适合那种服装？

129
All right, so aren't you?
好吧，所以你不是？

130
All right, very good.
好吧，非常好。

131
So those are the two phrases for Fluency Builder today.
所以今天的流利构建者有这两个短语。

132
Let's listen quickly to our dialogue one more time, and we'll be right back.
让我们快速再听一遍我们的对话，我们马上回来。

133
Trick-or-treat!
“不给糖就捣蛋！”

134
Tom, aren't you a little too old to be trick-or-treating?

135
What are you talking about?

你的万圣节精神在哪里？

137
Didn't you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends?
你难道从来没有打扮成角色，和朋友们在邻里“不给糖就捣蛋”吗？

138
Of course I did, but when I was 10, trick-or-treating is for kids.
当然有，但当我10岁时，“不给糖就捣蛋”是给孩子们的。

139
Plus, I'm sure people would think you're a kidnapper or something, running around with kids at night.
而且，我敢肯定人们会认为你是个绑架者，晚上和孩子们一起跑来跑去。

140
Whatever, I'm going next door.
随便，我要去隔壁。

141
I heard Mrs. Robinson is giving out big bags of M&Ms.
我听说罗宾逊太太在发大袋的M&M。

142
All right, so Marco, have you ever trick-or-treated?
好吧，马尔科，你有“不给糖就捣蛋”过吗？

143
I didn't, I did.
我没有，我有。

144
I used to go trick-or-treating when I was little, and it was actually really fun.

145
We used to have competitions about who had the most candy.

146
I've heard about this.
我听说过这个。

147
Right, because you don't necessarily bring a bag, you bring a pillowcase.

148
Right.
对。

149
And you fill your pillowcase with candy.
然后你把糖果装进枕头套里。

150
Now the interesting thing is that sometimes you wouldn't necessarily only get candy from people.
现在有趣的是，有时你不一定只从人们那里得到糖果。

151
Right, sometimes you got weird things like pennies, or toothbrushes, or apples.
对，有时你会得到奇怪的东西，比如硬币、牙刷或苹果。

152
Yeah, so you would go to someone's house and they would give you an old lady who lived near, well, she lived in the neighborhood, and every neighborhood had one, you know?
是的，所以你会去某人的家，他们会给你一个住在附近的老太太，嗯，她住在邻里，每个邻里都有一个，你知道吗？

153
All my friends had a lady they would go to, and she gave the full-size candy bars.
我所有的朋友都有一个她会去的老太太，她给全尺寸的糖果棒。

154
Wow.
哇。

155
Right, because normally stores sell small candy bars for the Halloween holiday, because they're smaller, they're cheaper, it's easier to give them to many people, but there's always one person who has the big full-size candy bars, and everyone goes to her.
对，因为通常商店会卖小糖果棒作为万圣节的节日，因为它们更小，更便宜，更容易给很多人，但总有一个人有大号的糖果棒，大家都去找她。

156
Right, exactly.
对，正是如此。

157
And actually it's amazing how Halloween is such an important event in the States, because everyone dresses up, everyone puts out decorations, or pumpkins outside of their homes.

158
They have pumpkin carving contests, which are really cool how they carve out pumpkins.

167
It's actually a very fun holiday.
这实际上是一个非常有趣的节日。

168
It's really interesting, and it's kind of strange when people really oppose it, because they say that it has to do with the devil, or it has to do... it's a pagan ritual and things like this, but you know, it's just good fun.
这真的很有趣，当人们真的反对它时，因为他们说这与魔鬼有关，或者这与...这是一个异教徒的仪式之类的，但你知道，这只是好玩。

169
It's fun, it's silly, everyone likes to dress up in a costume.
这很有趣，很傻，每个人都喜欢打扮成角色。

170

171
As an adult or a child?
作为成年人还是孩子？

172
Because I know you've dressed up as an adult as well.
因为我知道你作为成年人也打扮过。

173
I dress up every year.
我每年都打扮。

174
I was Pippi Longstocking last year.
我去年打扮成了长袜子皮皮。

175
Well, as a child, one year, I dressed up as an injured soldier, because my dad was in the military, so we always had fatigues around the house, and so I used his fatigues and I put blood on my face and I had crutches, and people thought that I really had a broken leg,
嗯，作为孩子，有一年，我打扮成受伤的士兵，因为我爸爸在军队，所以我们家总是有迷彩服，所以我用他的迷彩服，脸上涂了血，还拿着拐杖，人们以为我真的摔断了腿，

176
so they used to give me double... that year they gave me double the candy, because I thought, oh, here's a poor girl in crutches.
所以那一年他们给了我双倍的糖果，因为他们觉得，哦，这里有个可怜的女孩在拐杖上。

177
And trick-or-treating.
和“不给糖就捣蛋”。

178
And my costume was an injured soldier, so they just didn't understand it.
