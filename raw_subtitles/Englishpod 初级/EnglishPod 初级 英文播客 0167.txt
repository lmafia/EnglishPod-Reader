First, let's check out some of these very important phrases in today's language takeaway.
首先，让我们看看今天语言学习中的一些非常重要的短语。

44
Language takeaway.
语言学习。

45
Alright, so in language takeaway we have five words for you today.
好吧，在语言学习中我们今天有五个单词。

46
Starting with the first one, the steering wheel.
首先是方向盘。

47
Okay, steering wheel.
好的，方向盘。

48
So this comes from the fact that we have a wheel that we use to turn the car left and right.
这源于我们有一个轮子，用来左右转动汽车。

49
And so that's called to steer, to change the direction of something.
所以这叫做转向，改变某物的方向。

50
So the verb to steer is to take it left or right.
所以动词转向是指向左或右。

51
Exactly, so steering wheel is the instrument that we use to change the car's direction.
没错，方向盘是我们用来改变汽车方向的工具。

52
Very good.
非常好。

53
And well, apart from this instrument, also in order to look to other cars that are behind you, you would look at your rear view mirror.
除了这个工具，想要查看后面的汽车，你需要看后视镜。

54
Great, so rear view mirror.
很好，所以后视镜。

55
This is a mirror that you have in front of you in the middle of the car.
这是你在车中间前方的一个镜子。

56
And you look at this mirror to find out if there are cars behind you.
你看这个镜子是为了查看后面是否有车。

57
So it's a rear view.
所以这是一个后视。

58
That means you're looking at the back.
这意味着你在看后面。

59
Rear means back or behind.
后面意味着后方或背后。

60
What about the mirrors that are on the side of the car, on the doors?
那么车门旁边的镜子呢？

61
Those are called side view mirrors.
那些叫做侧视镜。

62
Side view mirrors.
侧视镜。

63
Very literal.
非常直白。

64
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

65
And well, moving on, he was instructing her on how to drive and he said, step on the clutch.
继续，他在教她如何驾驶，并说，踩下离合器。

66
Well, this is an important word for those of you who are driving manual cars.
这是一个对那些驾驶手动汽车的人来说很重要的词。

67
That means that you have to control the way that the gas goes into the engine by yourself.
这意味着你必须自己控制油门进入发动机的方式。

68
And so a clutch is a pedal.
所以离合器是一个踏板。

69
It's the third pedal on the left and you push this pedal to change gears.
它是左边的第三个踏板，你踩下这个踏板来换挡。

70
Okay, so some cars they don't have this.
好的，有些车没有这个。

71
For those of you who don't, don't worry about it.
对于那些没有的人，不用担心。

72
But if you do, a clutch is on the far left.
但如果有，离合器在最左边。

73
It's the third pedal.
它是第三个踏板。

74
Okay, so this is for a manual car, manual transmission car because many people have automatics where you just accelerate and the car automatically changes gears.
好的，这适用于手动汽车，因为许多人驾驶自动汽车，只需加速，汽车会自动换挡。

75
Exactly, and so a lot of Europeans drive manual cars and have this clutch.
没错，很多欧洲人驾驶手动汽车并有这个离合器。

76
Okay, so you step on the clutch and in order to change gear you say to shift into first gear.
好的，所以你踩下离合器，然后为了换挡，你说换到一档。

77
That's right, because if you're driving you know that you can't go from first to fifth gear, right?
没错，因为如果你在驾驶，你知道你不能从一档直接换到五档，对吧？

78
There's four or five gears and so you have to go one, two, three, four, five.
有四个或五个档位，所以你必须依次换挡。

79
You have to go in order.
你必须按顺序进行。

80
So we're shifting, we're moving up or we're moving down.
所以我们在换挡，我们在向上或向下移动。

81
So that's called to shift.
所以这叫做换挡。

82
All right, to shift.
好吧，换挡。

83
And now in the dialogue we heard to shift into first gear.
在对话中我们听到换到一档。

84
So that's what it's called.
所以这就是它的叫法。

85
Exactly, and so normally the car starts in N, neutral.
没错，通常汽车从N档（空档）开始。

86
That was when you're at a brake, you're at a stop.
那是在你刹车时，你停下来的时候。

87
And if you want to start the car you have to shift to first gear and that's the lowest that's gonna help the car go.
如果你想启动汽车，你必须换到一档，这是最低的档位，可以帮助汽车起步。

88
Okay, so to shift into first gear.
好的，所以换到一档。

89
Awesome vocabulary.
很棒的词汇。

90
I think this is really useful especially because it's very specific so you don't really see it very often in anywhere but sometimes you need to use it.
我认为这非常有用，特别是因为它非常具体，所以你在其他地方不常见，但有时你需要使用它。

91
That's right and it's especially useful if you're trying to teach someone how to drive.
没错，尤其是在你试图教别人如何驾驶时特别有用。

92
Yeah, because not everyone knows how to drive manual.
是的，因为并不是每个人都知道如何驾驶手动汽车。

93
Exactly.
没错。

94
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back to explain Fluency Builder.

151
Well, no, it's not literal.

152
Otherwise, I think I might kill the person because a million times means that we've had this same conversation many, many, many times, but you can't actually have it a million times.
否则，我想我可能会杀了那个人，因为一百万次意味着我们已经进行了很多很多次同样的对话，但你实际上不可能进行一百万次。

162
Okay, so this is a very common car phrase again, especially when you're dealing with the police.
好吧，这又是一个非常常见的汽车短语，尤其是当你和警察打交道时。

163
So to pull over means to slow the car down and to stop it on the side of the road.

164
So you could hear a policeman say pull over.
所以你可以听到警察说靠边停车。

That means slow down and stop the car on the side because obviously you can't stop in the middle of the road.
这意味着减速并在路边停车，因为显然你不能在路中间停车。

Right.
对。

180
So there he says, they'll never capture me.
所以他说，他们永远不会抓住我。

225
They'll never take me alive.
他们永远不会活抓我。

226
All right, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

227
So driving now, this is interesting because as you mentioned, a lot of people in America usually have automatic transmissions, whereas in Europe, maybe they have manual transmissions.
所以现在开车，这很有趣，因为正如你提到的，美国很多人通常使用自动变速器，而在欧洲，可能他们使用手动变速器。

228
Exactly.
正是如此。

229
Is there a reason for that?
这有什么原因吗？

230
Do you think?
你觉得呢？

231
Um, I'm not sure what the reason would be.
嗯，我不太确定原因是什么。

232
I think a lot of American car makers manufacture more automatic cars in general.
我认为很多美国汽车制造商一般生产更多的自动汽车。

233
Some people say that it's because people in America are less concerned with gas, but if you have a manual transmission, you can actually conserve a bit of gas.
有些人说这是因为美国人对油价不太关心，但如果你有手动变速器，实际上可以节省一些油。

234
And so because gas prices in Europe are higher, generally, more people are interested in having manual transmissions.
所以因为欧洲的油价普遍较高，更多人对手动变速器感兴趣。

235
Also, I remember when I was younger, my dad always bought cars that had a manual transmission because he said that if ever they break down, it's much easier and cheaper to fix in a car that has a manual transmission than it is to fix an automatic one.
此外，我记得我年轻时，我爸爸总是买手动变速器的车，因为他说如果车坏了，修理手动变速器的车比修理自动变速器的车要容易和便宜得多。

236
That's right.
没错。

237
Well, I personally think that it's better to learn how to drive on a manual transmission car because you can drive any car afterwards, but if you learn an automatic, you'll never know how to drive a manual.
嗯，我个人认为学习如何驾驶手动变速器的车更好，因为之后你可以驾驶任何车，但如果你只学自动的，你就永远不会知道如何驾驶手动的。

238
There was also a case on television recently about a small child that, actually the dialogue is based on it, is he took his dad's car and he was like seven years old and he was driving and was being chased by the police.
最近电视上还有一个案例，关于一个小孩，实际上这个对话就是基于这个，他开了他爸爸的车，只有七岁，正在开车，还被警察追。

239
No way.
不可能。

240
And then he pulled into his house and got out of the car and ran into the house.
然后他开进了家里，跳下车跑进了屋里。

241
So obviously he was an underage driver, but he didn't get into much trouble, but it was interesting because he drove very, very well.
所以显然他是未成年驾驶，但他没有惹上太多麻烦，但有趣的是他开得非常好。

242
That's unbelievable.
这真是不可思议。

243
And basically almost learned it by game simulators, by video games on how you drive on a video game.
他基本上是通过游戏模拟器，电子游戏学习如何开车的。

244
Oh wow.
哦，哇。

245
Well, Nascar, here he comes.
好吧，Nascar，他来了。

246
Right.
对。

247
