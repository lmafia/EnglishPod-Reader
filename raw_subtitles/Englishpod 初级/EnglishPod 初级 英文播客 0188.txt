35
So now, why don't we take a look at Language Takeaway.

我们刚刚听到的对话是经理或老板与员工之间的对话。

38
And the employee says, listen, I need to talk to you about something.
员工说，听着，我需要和你谈谈。

39
I have been an employee at this prestigious firm for over 10 years.
我在这家著名公司工作超过10年了。

40
So prestigious is our first word.
所以“著名”是我们的第一个词。

41
Okay.
好的。

42
Prestigious is an adjective, right?
“著名”是一个形容词，对吗？

43
That's right.
没错。

44
And it means very respected, very well known.
它的意思是非常受尊敬，非常知名。

45
Esteemed.
受人尊敬的。

46
That's right.
没错。

47
So something that is prestigious has a good reputation.
所以“著名”的东西有良好的声誉。

48
Like, for example, some universities, like you hear all the time about American universities like Harvard or Yale, which are considered to be prestigious universities.
比如，一些大学，比如你经常听到的美国大学，如哈佛或耶鲁，被认为是著名大学。

49
Or the Nobel Peace Prize is a very prestigious award.

50
Okay, so it's an adjective to describe something that's respectable, well known, or esteemed, as you say.
好的，所以这是一个形容词，用来描述某些值得尊敬、知名或受人尊敬的事物。

51
Exactly.

This is what we've been experiencing in the global economy this last year or two.
这是我们在过去一年或两年中在全球经济中经历的事情。

55
It's called an economic downturn.
这被称为经济衰退。

56
All right, so an economic downturn is something negative, as you said.
好的，所以经济衰退是负面的，正如你所说。

57
So it means that the economy is not doing very well.
这意味着经济状况不太好。

58
Right, so economy, economic, you know what this means.
对，所以经济、经济的，你知道这是什么意思。

59
But in this case, downturn is the key part of this phrase, to slow down or to decrease.
但在这种情况下，衰退是这个短语的关键部分，意味着放缓或减少。

60
So a downturn is a time when less people are making money and less money overall is being earned.
所以衰退是一个时期，少数人赚钱，整体收入减少。

61
Okay, so an economic downturn.
好的，所以经济衰退。

62
Very good.
非常好。

63
Why don't we move on to our next word, which is negative impact.
我们为什么不继续下一个词，负面影响。

64
So the thing working here is the economic downturn.
所以这里的因素是经济衰退。

65
And it has had a negative impact on our sales, on this company's sales.
它对我们的销售产生了负面影响，对这家公司的销售。

66
So a negative impact, as you know from the first word, is not a good thing.
所以负面影响，正如你从第一个词中知道的，是不好的事情。

67
Right, it's an effect, right?
对，这是一个影响，对吧？

68
An effect, but that's negative.
一个影响，但这是负面的。

69
So it's not a good effect.
所以这不是一个好的影响。

So Marco, your hard work has had a really positive impact on this company lately.
所以Marco，你的努力工作最近对这家公司产生了非常积极的影响。

74
All right, good.
好的，好的。

75
So you can use it negative impact or a positive impact.
所以你可以使用负面影响或积极影响。

76
All right, right.
好的，没错。

77
So impact, again, is just the effect that something has on something else.
所以影响，再次是某事对其他事物的影响。

78
And well, the boss said that he agrees to give them a raise because, in part, he didn't want to start a brain drain.
而且，老板说他同意给他们加薪，因为部分原因是他不想开始人才流失。

79
What's that?
那是什么？

80
Oh, this is a very common phrase you hear about countries, they have a brain drain or they want to avoid a brain drain.
哦，这是一个你经常听到的短语，关于国家，他们有人才流失或想要避免人才流失。

A drain is the part of a sink or a bathtub where the water goes down.
流失是水槽或浴缸中水流下去的部分。

82
Okay, it goes away.
好的，它流走了。

83
And so brain drain means all the brains or intelligent people or educated people leave a country and go to another country, or in this case, leave a company and go to another company.
所以人才流失意味着所有的聪明人或受过教育的人离开一个国家，去另一个国家，或者在这种情况下，离开一家公司，去另一家公司。

84
All right.
好的。

85
So for example, if all the employees at Apple, maybe they start to quit or they are they start to move jobs and start to work for maybe Microsoft or Google, that's a brain drain, right?
所以例如，如果苹果公司的所有员工，可能他们开始辞职或换工作，去微软或谷歌工作，那就是人才流失，对吧？

86
That's right because you're talking about a large number of people.
没错，因为你在谈论大量的人。

87
Maybe they're all unhappy because they say that working at Apple is not very nice.
也许他们都不快乐，因为他们说在苹果工作并不好。

88
So they all leave and go to this other company.
所以他们都离开，去这家公司。

89
The same is true with countries.
国家也是如此。

90
You can have very, very well educated people who, when they stop studying, they want jobs, they all look somewhere else.
你可以有非常受过良好教育的人，当他们停止学习时，他们想找工作，他们都去别处。

91
They go to America or Mexico or England.
他们去美国、墨西哥或英国。

92
And so that's called a brain drain because they all go away.
所以这被称为人才流失，因为他们都离开了。

93
Okay, so five great phrases right there and words for you.
好的，所以这里有五个很棒的短语和单词。

但我认为请求加薪是非常困难的，因为你知道你的老板担心钱，或者现在不是请求的好时机，但你想请求，因为你希望得到合适的报酬。
