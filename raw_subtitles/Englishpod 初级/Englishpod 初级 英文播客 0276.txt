Let's take a look at some more words on language takeaway part two.

129
What are these?

130
The operator guarantees that there are no hidden fees.

131
So this is usually what we call the fine print, the small fees that we don't really know about.

132
So they say, oh, it costs $3 a month.
他们说，哦，每月费用是3美元。

133
But you have small little hidden fees.
但你有一些小的隐藏费用。

134
Like if you're late on a payment, they'll charge you an extra dollar.
比如如果你晚付款，他们会多收你一美元。

135
Or if you use the service too much, they'll charge you another extra dollar.
或者如果你使用服务过多，他们会再收你一美元。

136
Right.

137
So a fee is something that you pay.
所以费用是你需要支付的东西。

138
All right.
好的。

139
And something that is hidden means you cannot see it.
而隐藏的东西意味着你看不见它。

140
And so like you're saying with this example, there are many, many conditions, many, many different things, rules that we have to follow.
就像你说的这个例子，有很多条件，很多不同的规则我们必须遵循。

141
And if we don't follow those rules exactly, then maybe this company that provides the phone service will ask us for more and more money.
如果我们不完全遵循这些规则，那么提供电话服务的公司可能会要求我们支付更多的钱。

142
That's right.
没错。

143
And actually it has to do a lot with our next word, where she said that there are also no surcharges.
这实际上与下一个词有关，她说没有附加费。

144
Okay, so a surcharge is an extra amount of money that you have to pay.
好的，附加费是你必须支付的额外费用。

145
So we say that this service has no hidden fees or surcharges.
所以我们说这个服务没有隐藏费用或附加费。

146
So that means that we don't have to pay anything additional to what we are already paying.
这意味着我们不需要支付任何额外的费用。

147
For example, some companies will say, okay, pay us $10 and you get your new cell phone plan.
例如，一些公司会说，好的，给我们10美元，你就可以获得新的手机计划。

148
But to activate your service is another $5.
但激活服务又要5美元。

149
So the total price is $15.
所以总价格是15美元。

150
And that's a surcharge.
这就是附加费。

151
That's an extra fee that you have to pay.
这是你必须支付的额外费用。

152
That's right.
没错。

153
Okay, and continuing on the topic of money, she says it is a flat monthly rate, a flat monthly rate.
好的，继续谈论费用，她说这是一个固定的月费，固定的月费。

154
Well, monthly is an adverb that tells us how often we pay.
好吧，月费是一个副词，告诉我们支付的频率。

155
We pay one time every month.
我们每月支付一次。

156
But this term flat rate is very, very important.
但这个术语固定费率非常重要。

157
And it happened.
而且它发生了。

158
We use this term a lot when we're talking about paying fees.
我们在谈论支付费用时经常使用这个术语。

159
So a flat rate means it does not change when you, for example, talk more on the phone.
所以固定费率意味着当你，比如说，通话时间更多时，它不会改变。

160
That's right.
没错。

161
So you pay the same amount every month.
所以你每个月支付相同的金额。

162
That's right.
没错。

163
A clear example is probably your Internet service provider.
一个明确的例子可能是你的互联网服务提供商。

164
You pay $20 a month and that's a flat rate.
你每月支付20美元，这是一个固定费率。

165
If you use the Internet 24 hours a day, nothing happens.
如果你每天使用互联网24小时，没事。

166
You don't pay more.
你不会支付更多。

167
If you use it less, you still pay the same amount of money.
如果你使用得少，你仍然支付相同的金额。

168
So what if I pay $10 normally, but this month I use the Internet a lot and now I have to pay $15.
那如果我正常支付10美元，但这个月我使用互联网很多，现在我必须支付15美元。

169
Is that a flat rate?
这算是固定费率吗？

170
No, no, that's not a flat rate.
不，不，这不是固定费率。

171
Okay, that changes with my use.
好的，这与我的使用情况有关。

172
That's right.
没错。

173
Okay, and now let's take a look at one last service that this man was also interested in getting.
好的，现在让我们看看这个男人也感兴趣的最后一项服务。

174
And he says that he wants to get a call forwarding service.
他表示他想获得来电转接服务。

175
He wants to forward his calls to a local number.
他想把电话转接到本地号码。

176
Okay, so to forward something means to pass it along.
好的，转接意味着传递。

177
So call forwarding means that if I'm not available, for example, I'm not at home and someone calls my home, there's no one there to talk to the person that's calling, then maybe I could have a call forwarding service that will make the call go to my cellular phone.
所以来电转接意味着如果我不在，比如说，我不在家，有人拨打我的电话，家里没有人接电话，那么我可以有一个来电转接服务，将电话转到我的手机。

178
All right, so the call forwarding means that the call will travel to another phone.
好的，所以来电转接意味着电话会转到另一个电话。

179
That's right, that's right.
没错，没错。

180
So as you said, this is what call forwarding is and the word to forward, as you said, to pass along.
正如你所说，这就是来电转接，转接这个词，正如你所说，传递。

181
Maybe many of you have done it in your emails when you get maybe a nice message, you forward it to more of your friends.
也许你们中的许多人在收到一条不错的消息时会在电子邮件中转发给更多的朋友。

182
And this is the exact same definition.
这就是完全相同的定义。

183
Exactly.
正是如此。

184
So you have one message and you pass it on to someone else.
所以你有一条消息，然后转发给其他人。

185
And so in call forwarding, you normally have this service if you're often on business trips or traveling, you're out of town.
所以在来电转接中，如果你经常出差或旅行，不在一个地方，这项服务通常会提供。

186
That's right.
没错。

187
It's very, very helpful for people who are not in one place all the time.
对于那些不总是在一个地方的人来说，这非常有帮助。

188
That's right.
没错。

189
So why don't we listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll be back in a bit.
所以我们为什么不最后再听一遍对话，我们很快就会回来。

190
Telco Mobile, how can I help you?

好的。

195
That sounds great.
听起来不错。

196
Are there any other fees?
还有其他费用吗？

197
Not at all.
完全没有。

198
No hidden fees or surcharges.
没有隐藏费用或附加费。

199
It is a flat monthly rate.
这是一个固定的月费。

200
Perfect.

I also wanted to know if there's any call forwarding service.
我还想知道是否有呼叫转移服务。

202
I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number.

203
Yes, of course.
是的，当然。

204
We can activate all these services in about an hour.
我们可以在大约一个小时内激活所有这些服务。

205
So talking about all these services, it's very interesting because many of these services are not really available everywhere in the world.
说到这些服务，这很有趣，因为许多服务在世界各地并不普遍。

206
Like, for example, voicemail.
比如，语音邮件。

207
That's right.
没错。

208
So in China, no one really has voicemail.
所以在中国，几乎没有人有语音邮件。

209
It's very strange for an American because you think, well, if I'm not home, I want to know why this person called.
对于美国人来说，这很奇怪，因为你会想，如果我不在家，我想知道这个人为什么打电话。

210
But oftentimes you just have to call back and find out.
但很多时候你只需回拨电话找出原因。

211
That's right.
没错。

212
And actually, I really think that voicemail service is a very good thing, especially if you need to leave a message for someone, you know, hey, we're at the restaurant, call me back when you have a chance.
其实，我真的认为语音邮件服务是个好东西，特别是当你需要给某人留个信息时，比如，嘿，我们在餐厅，等你有空再给我回电话。

213
But also call waiting.
还有来电等待。

214
I really, really hate to call someone and have the busy, you know, the busy tone.
我真的非常讨厌打电话给某人却听到忙音。

215
Yeah.
是啊。

216
And then you know that they're on the telephone, but you don't know when they will stop talking on the phone.
然后你知道他们在通话，但不知道他们什么时候会停止。

217
This really annoys me too, especially when I call for delivery food from a restaurant.
这也让我很烦，尤其是当我从餐厅叫外卖时。

218
It's like, please answer your phone.
就是，请接电话。

219
Maybe someone's ordering a lot of food.
也许有人在点很多食物。

220
That's right.
没错。

221
So actually these services are very common in the United States.
这些服务在美国非常普遍。

222
And I'm not sure they're even more services now.
我不确定现在是否还有更多服务。

223
I know that you can have a telephone number, for example, in another country, but it'll ring in the United States.
我知道你可以在另一个国家有一个电话号码，但它会在美国响。

224
Yeah, that's right.
是的，没错。

225
Or you can connect to your computer and your messaging service and all these things to your phone.
或者你可以将你的电脑和消息服务等连接到你的电话。

226
So it's pretty, pretty technologically advanced, but I'm very curious to know about you guys, our listeners, what kind of services for your cell phone or for your landline do you have?
所以这在技术上相当先进，但我很想知道你们，我们的听众，你们的手机或座机有什么服务？
