So let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

28
I suppose I'm quite a restless character.

39
So before we get into analyzing that, why don't we take a look at a couple of words she used on language takeaway.

40
One of the first words that Mr. Parsons used was a clear impression, so impression.
Parsons先生使用的第一个词是清晰的印象，所以印象。

41
Alright, so I think this is a very common word when people talk about first impressions, or I get the impression.

42
So what is an impression?
那么，什么是印象？

43
Well, an impression is like an idea, or a feeling.
印象就像一个想法或感觉。

44
So I can have an impression about something, it means that I don't necessarily understand it really well, or don't have experience with it, but it's an idea that I have about something.
我可以对某事有一个印象，这意味着我不一定真的理解它，或者没有经验，但这是我对某事的想法。

没错，例如，也许你遇到一个新朋友，你说，我有一种他是个骗子的印象。

46
But maybe then you get to know him and he's not.

48
So in this case, Mr. Parsons has a clear impression of her positive qualities.
在这种情况下，Parsons先生对她的积极品质有清晰的印象。

That means that he has an idea or an understanding of the things that Rebecca is good at, but he wants to know more about her weaknesses.

That's right, and Mr. Parsons asked her to try and pinpoint one of her weaknesses.

51
So this word, to pinpoint.

This is a great word, I'm not really sure where it comes from in English, but I think it's very visual.

53
You can see what the word means.
你可以看到这个词的意思。

54
Pinpoint means to locate, or identify, or really be specific about something.

55
That's right, so maybe if you go to the doctor and you say that your back hurts, the doctor might ask you to try and pinpoint where on your back you have the pain.
没错，所以也许如果你去看医生，你说你的背痛，医生可能会问你尝试指出你背上哪里有痛。

56
That's right, so it's a way to be specific, or very exact about something.
没错，所以这是一个具体或非常准确的方式。

57
Okay, so if she had to pinpoint something, she said, well, I do get a little bit frustrated.

现在，如果我们看看这个词，它实际上是一个形容词，我们通常使用它，你感到沮丧，或者正如你所说，你感到沮丧。

Okay, well let's move on to talk about the job position here, shall we?
好吧，那我们来谈谈这里的职位吧，可以吗？

161
Yes, please.
是的，请。

162
Alright, so talking about weaknesses, I think one of the common mistakes when people talk about weaknesses is they say they work too much.
好吧，谈到弱点，我认为人们谈论弱点时常见的错误之一是他们说自己工作太多。

163
And everyone says you should never say that in an interview.
每个人都说你在面试中绝对不应该这么说。

164
Yeah, I think it's a it's a bad way to talk about yourself, because a boss or an employer really wants to hear a real weakness.
是的，我认为这是一种糟糕的自我描述方式，因为老板或雇主真的想听到一个真实的弱点。

165
And I work too hard is a way of saying, I have no weaknesses.
而“我工作太努力”是一种说法，表示我没有弱点。

166
I'm actually really, really perfect.
我实际上是非常完美的。

167
I just think it's a lazy answer, so maybe you should avoid saying I work too hard and really focus on things that you you do have to to work on.
我只是觉得这是一个懒惰的回答，所以也许你应该避免说“我工作太努力”，而真正关注你需要改进的地方。

168
And then I think the key is to say that I know this is something that I have a hard time with, I know this is a weakness, and I'm trying to improve it.
然后我认为关键是说，我知道这是我有困难的地方，我知道这是一个弱点，我正在努力改善它。

169
Yeah, I remember in some of the interviews I've had, I think my common answer was, I am sometimes I'm very late, I'm not very punctual.
是的，我记得在我参加的一些面试中，我的常见回答是，我有时很晚，不太守时。

170
So, but you know, it's a real weakness, and it may seem like difficult, but then you give it a little spin by saying, yeah I'm sometimes not very punctual, but then I try to make up for it, maybe it's staying more time at the office, or sometimes I try to wake up a little bit earlier and make it on time.
所以，但你知道，这是一个真实的弱点，可能看起来很困难，但然后你可以稍微转变一下，说，是的，我有时不太守时，但我会努力弥补，比如在办公室多待一会儿，或者有时我会试着早起一点，准时到。

171
I don't know, something like that.
我不知道，类似的事情。

172
Right, so the key there is just to show that you know it's a problem and that you're trying to work on it.
对，所以关键是要表明你知道这是个问题，并且你正在努力解决它。

173
Yeah, so this is actually the hardest part for me of an interview, talking about yourself in a negative way, because obviously you want to get the job, so you want to make sure that the employer has a good idea of yourself, but it's hard.
是的，所以这实际上是我面试中最难的部分，以消极的方式谈论自己，因为显然你想得到这份工作，所以你想确保雇主对你有一个好的印象，但这很难。

174
I think it's the hardest part for everyone.
我认为这是每个人最难的部分。

175
Yeah, I don't think it's just you.
是的，我不认为只有你这样。

176
Yeah, it's hard.
