People are eating large meals with their families, and I think oftentimes when you cook a lot of food, you have something extra at the end.
人们和家人一起吃大餐，我觉得通常当你做很多食物时，最后会有一些剩下的。

5
What do we call that?

6
That's right.

That's the extra food after your meal that you eat later, maybe the next day.
这就是你吃完饭后留着的额外食物，可能是第二天吃的。

10
Exactly.
正是如此。

11
So, you know, during Christmas or during some holidays, we cook so much food that obviously we can't eat it all, so we put it back in the refrigerator and then we eat it later.
所以，你知道，在圣诞节或某些假期，我们做了很多食物，显然不能全部吃完，所以我们把它放回冰箱，稍后再吃。

12
So those are called leftovers.
所以这些叫做剩菜。

13
Alright, so let's listen to this dialogue about leftovers, and we'll be back in a moment to discuss what's happening in the dialogue.

I took the leftover Turkey, mixed it with some diced peppers and onions, added a little bit of mayonnaise, and made some sandwiches.

21
I mean, bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or reheated?
我的意思是，细菌和病菌在放置或重新加热的食物上繁殖？

22
Well, I didn't leave the Turkey at room temperature for more than an hour, and I refrigerated soon after we finished eating.
嗯，我没有把火鸡放在室温下超过一个小时，吃完后很快就放进冰箱了。

23
Also, when reheating, I put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 100 degrees Celsius.
此外，重新加热时，我把它放在烤箱里以100摄氏度加热15分钟。

24
Well, okay.
好吧。

Not only do you save money, but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat.
你不仅省钱，还能发挥创意，吃到不同的东西。

29
Alright, so a lot of vocab there.
好吧，这里有很多词汇。

30
Let's take a look at it in Language Takeaway.
让我们在语言收获中看看。

31
Language Takeaway Alright, so Marco, there's one cooking term, really, in this dialogue that is a little bit different from the others, so let's start with that.
语言收获 好吧，Marco，这段对话中有一个烹饪术语，和其他的有点不同，所以我们先从这个开始。

32
It's diced.
是切丁。

33
That's right.
没错。

34
We were talking about taking some peppers, or diced peppers.
我们在谈论切一些辣椒，或者切丁的辣椒。

35
So when you dice a vegetable, or anything that you're cooking, basically you're making little pieces, little squares almost.
所以当你切一个蔬菜，或者任何你在烹饪的东西时，基本上是把它切成小块，几乎是小方块。

36
That's right.
没错。

37
So you can cut something many different ways.
所以你可以用很多不同的方式切东西。

38
You can cut big pieces and small pieces, but diced peppers.
你可以切大块和小块，但切丁的辣椒。

39
Diced is a specific way to cut something in small, like you say, small squares.
切丁是一种特定的切法，像你说的，小方块。

40
And so in recipes, you will often see this instruction, dice the peppers.
所以在食谱中，你经常会看到这个指示，切丁辣椒。

41
Or, in this case, the peppers are diced.
或者，在这种情况下，辣椒是切丁的。

42
That's right.
没错。

43
Alright, so we took some Turkey, mixed it with diced peppers and a lot of things, and the roommate was a little bit concerned about bacteria and germs.
好吧，我们把一些火鸡和切丁的辣椒以及很多东西混合在一起，室友对细菌和病菌有点担心。

44
Alright, so bacteria and germs, these sound like very scientific words.
好吧，细菌和病菌，这听起来像是非常科学的词。

45
Bacteria is something that grows on, well, everything really.
细菌是生长在，嗯，几乎所有东西上的东西。

46
But if you leave food out, for example, it gets bacteria.
但如果你把食物放置，比如说，它会滋生细菌。

47
Or germs are things that can make you sick.
或者病菌是会让你生病的东西。

48
That's right.
没错。

49
And so we need to avoid these things in the kitchen because they make us unhealthy.
所以我们需要在厨房里避免这些东西，因为它们会让我们不健康。

50
And that's why we wash our hands and things like that.
这就是为什么我们要洗手和类似的事情。

51
But when you have food that's left out, the risk is what, Marco?
但是当你有放置的食物时，风险是什么，Marco？

52
Is that you get bacteria or germs on it.
就是你会在上面得到细菌或病菌。

53
Yeah, so it's dangerous, especially with meat.
是的，所以这很危险，尤其是肉类。

54
If you leave it out, it's very, very dangerous because you can get some bacteria that will make you sick.
如果你把它放置，真的非常危险，因为你可能会得到一些会让你生病的细菌。

55
And the reason why we're a little bit concerned, especially with meat, is if you leave it out, after cooking it, at room temperature.
而我们有点担心，尤其是肉类，是因为如果你在烹饪后把它放在室温下。

56
Alright, so room temperature is the temperature of a normal room.
好吧，室温是正常房间的温度。

57
Maybe it's 65 degrees or what, 25 degrees Celsius.
也许是65度或25度摄氏。

58
It's the temperature of the inside of a room.
这是房间内部的温度。

59
And so it's not cold, it's not hot, it's just normal.
所以它不冷，也不热，就是正常。

60
And when we leave food out, especially meat like you're saying, we have to be careful.
当我们把食物放置，尤其是你说的肉类时，我们必须小心。

61
You can't leave it out for very long if it's something like eggs or milk or what we call perishables.
如果是像鸡蛋或牛奶这样的易腐烂食品，就不能放置太久。

62
That's right.
没错。

63
So actually, here comes the other two words that are a little bit of a contrast.
所以实际上，这里有另外两个词有点对比。

64
We're going to talk about food that is reheated or refrigerated.
我们要谈论的是重新加热或冷藏的食物。

65
Alright, so the roommate is explaining, don't worry, we have done these things to this food so it's safe.
好吧，室友在解释，不用担心，我们对这食物做了这些处理，所以它是安全的。

66
So one thing you can do to food to make it safe to kill germs is to reheat it.
所以你可以对食物做的一件事是重新加热它，以杀死病菌。

67
That means, well you know the word heated, right?
这意味着，嗯，你知道加热这个词，对吧？

68
It's to make something hot.
是让某物变热。

69
But how is that different from reheated?
但这和重新加热有什么不同？

70
Well, because you cooked it already, so it was warm.
嗯，因为你已经煮过了，所以它是温暖的。

71
Now it went a little bit cold because it's at room temperature.
现在它变得有点冷，因为它在室温下。

72
So in order to make sure that it's safe to eat and you kill that bacteria, you reheat it.
所以为了确保它安全可吃并杀死细菌，你重新加热它。

73
So you kind of cook it again a little bit.
所以你有点再煮一次。

74
Yeah, you cook it again.
是的，你再煮一次。

75
So with leftovers we often have to reheat things.
所以对于剩菜，我们通常需要重新加热东西。

76
Because they were hot, then they were cold, and now we want them hot again.
因为它们是热的，然后变冷，现在我们想要它们再次热。

77
That's right.
没错。

78
So we reheat them.
所以我们重新加热它们。

79
The opposite of that would be refrigerate.
这与冷藏相反。

80
Right, and this is what you should do if you take something and put it in the refrigerator.
对，冷藏是你应该做的，如果你把某物放进冰箱。

81
What you are doing, the verb, the action, is to refrigerate it.
你正在做的动作是冷藏它。

82
That's right.
没错。

83
So to refrigerate something means to make it cold.
所以冷藏某物意味着让它变冷。

84
You know, there are important things that we refrigerate.
你知道，有一些重要的东西我们需要冷藏。

85
We refrigerate eggs, we refrigerate milk, we refrigerate butter.
我们冷藏鸡蛋，冷藏牛奶，冷藏黄油。

86
These are things that can make us sick if we don't make them cold.
这些东西如果不冷藏会让我们生病。

87
Exactly.
没错。

88
So those are the two words.
所以这就是两个词。

89
Now obviously it's a little bit different because the prefix to reheat means to do it again.
现在显然有点不同，因为重新加热的前缀意味着再做一次。

90
While to refrigerate means you're just making it cold.
而冷藏意味着你只是让它变冷。

91
Yeah.
是的。

92
Well, there are important terms, and again we also have the adjectives.
好吧，这些是重要的术语，还有形容词。

93
This is reheated or refrigerated.
这是重新加热或冷藏。

94
But there are another couple of phrases that are really important, so let's take a listen to those in Fluency Builder.
但还有另外几个非常重要的短语，所以让我们在流利构建中听听这些。

95
Alright, so the first phrase we're going to take a look at is when one of the roommates says, Hey, what's for dinner?
好吧，我们要看的第一个短语是当其中一个室友说，嘿，晚餐吃什么？

96
What's for dinner?
晚餐吃什么？

97
Alright, this is a very, very standard phrase.
好吧，这是一个非常标准的短语。

98
This is something you'll hear at home, you'll hear with your friends.
这是你在家里会听到的，你会和朋友听到的。

99
It's usually something we say when someone is cooking food for dinner.

100
That's right.

105
Well, obviously you don't want to say the long phrase, What are we going to have for dinner tonight?

106
So you just say, What's for dinner?
所以你只说，晚餐吃什么？

107
What's for dinner?
晚餐吃什么？

108
And then the answer would be lasagna or Turkey sandwiches.
然后答案可能是千层面或火鸡三明治。

109
Right, exactly.
对，没错。

110
Now when they started talking about the leftover Turkey, he was a little bit concerned, as we said, about bacteria and germs because it usually happens that you get this on food that was left out.
现在当他们开始谈论剩下的火鸡时，他有点担心，正如我们所说的，关于细菌和病菌，因为通常会发生这种情况，食物放置太久。

111

好吧，这里的动词是“放置”，把某物放置在外面。

112
It means to leave something or put something at room temperature.
意思是把某物放在室温下。

113

所以马尔科，你和我在吃火鸡。

114
It's Thanksgiving.

115
And we start to have coffee and dessert and the Turkey is still in the room.

116
Right.

117
At room temperature.

好吧，这意味着它不在冰箱里。

124
That's right.
没错。

125
That's exactly what it means.
这正是它的意思。

126
So maybe you go to sleep and you left the Turkey out.
所以也许你去睡觉，火鸡被放在外面。

127
It's still on the table maybe at room temperature.
它可能仍然在桌子上，处于室温下。

128
Oh no, we can't eat it if we left it out for like 12 hours.
哦不，如果我们放置了12小时就不能吃了。

129
Exactly.
正是如此。

130
Alright, so it's not good to leave food out.
好吧，所以不应该把食物放在外面。

131
And now what happens is if you do eat food that was left out for too long, you could get food poisoning.
现在如果你吃了放置太久的食物，你可能会食物中毒。

132
Now this is very serious and it's something that you should be very careful about when you're cooking.
这非常严重，是你在烹饪时需要非常小心的事情。

133

136
