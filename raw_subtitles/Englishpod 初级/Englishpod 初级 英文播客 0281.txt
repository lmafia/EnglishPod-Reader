我觉得这是一个典型的说法。

272
Especially if you're asking someone out on a date, they might say, I really like you, but I see you more as a friend than anything else.
尤其是如果你在约某人出去，他们可能会说，我真的很喜欢你，但我把你看作朋友多于其他。

273
So there's another one that's very popular.

274
Sometimes you hear people say, I'm just not ready for a relationship.
有时你会听到人们说，我只是还没有准备好进入一段关系。

275
And that's also a cliche line.
这也是一句老套的话。

276
Or, I'm not ready to commit.

277
I'm not ready to commit.

278
And it's interesting because I think breaking up is one of the hardest things that people can do.
有趣的是，我认为分手是人们能做的最困难的事情之一。

279
And I think maybe this is why you just use one of these phrases that are so popular and common.
我觉得也许这就是为什么你会使用这些非常流行和常见的短语。

280
Because I guess it's kind of a good way to explain in very soft terms what you want to say and to break up with someone.
因为我想这是一种很好的方式，用非常温和的方式解释你想说的内容，并与某人分手。

281
That's right.
没错。

282
And I think that sometimes people are afraid to make the other person sad.
我觉得有时人们害怕让对方伤心。

283
And so they say these things that are very, you know, general.
所以他们说这些非常……你知道的，笼统的话。

284
Like, it's not you, it's me.
比如说，不是你，是我。

285
But sometimes this makes the other person even more sad because they don't understand why they're breaking up.
但有时这会让对方更加伤心，因为他们不明白为什么会分手。

286
What about breaking up over the telephone or breaking up with a letter?
关于通过电话分手或写信分手呢？

287
Generally, at least in America, we say that breaking up over email or letter or phone is not a good way to end a relationship.
通常，至少在美国，我们说通过电子邮件、信件或电话分手不是结束一段关系的好方法。

288
It's very cold.

289
It's very cold.

290
So the other person would be very angry if that happened.

291
That's right.
没错。

292
You just want to see the person and say, listen, let's have a conversation.
你只是想见到对方，告诉他们，听着，我们来谈谈。

293
Let's talk about this face to face.
我们面对面谈谈这个。

294
Okay.
好的。

295
So this is actually very interesting because as we say, maybe in other countries or in other cultures, it's not really a negative thing to break up over the phone or maybe send an email saying, you know what, I don't want to see you anymore.
这实际上很有趣，因为正如我们所说，也许在其他国家或文化中，通过电话分手或发送电子邮件说“我不想再见你了”并不算负面。

296
Right.
对。

297
So I'd be very curious to hear about you guys and your cultures and what happens when people break up where you live.
我很想听听你们的文化，以及你们那里人们分手时发生了什么。

298
So let us know.
