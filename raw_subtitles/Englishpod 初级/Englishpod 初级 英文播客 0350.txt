Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.
大家好，欢迎来到EnglishPod。

2
My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

3
My name is Catherine, and we're going to a family party today, right, Marco?
我叫Catherine，今天我们要去一个家庭聚会，对吧，Marco？

4
That's right.
没错。

5
We're going to go see our family, our relatives, and we're going to talk about all the different family members that you can have.
我们要去见我们的家人、亲戚，讨论一下你可以拥有的各种家庭成员。

6
So there's some very, very specific family members that sometimes you don't really know the names of.
有一些非常具体的家庭成员，有时你可能不知道他们的名字。

7
That's right.
没错。

8
So we're not talking about mother, father, brother, sister.
我们不是在谈论母亲、父亲、兄弟、姐妹。

9
We're talking about what we call in English extended family.
我们在谈论我们在英语中称之为扩展家庭的东西。

10
So that means not just the people you live with but also people you're related to, who are maybe in different parts of your family.
这意味着不仅是和你住在一起的人，还有与你有血缘关系的人，可能在你家庭的不同部分。

11
That's right.
没错。

12
So let's listen to our dialogue, and we'll be back in a bit.
那么让我们听听对话，稍后再回来。

13
What are you doing this weekend?
你这个周末在做什么？

14
My brother-in-law is having a small get-together at his house and he invited me.
我姐夫在他家举办一个小聚会，他邀请了我。

15
Is it a family thing or just friends?
是家庭聚会还是朋友聚会？

16
A bit of both.
两者都有。

17
Some cousins, aunts, and uncles will be there, but also some friends from the neighborhood.
会有一些表亲、姑姑和叔叔，但也会有一些邻居的朋友。

18
Is your great-uncle Rick going to be there?
你的外曾叔Rick会来吗？

19
He is really funny.
他真的很有趣。

20
Yeah, he's going to be there with his stepson and his ex-wife.
是的，他会和他的继子以及前妻一起到场。

21
You mean your sister?
你是说你的姐姐吗？

22
No, Rick is actually my great-uncle, so he's my grandmother's brother.
不，Rick实际上是我的外曾叔，他是我祖母的兄弟。

23
You lost me.
我听不懂了。

24
I'll explain later.
我稍后再解释。

25
Let's go.
我们走吧。

26
Alright, so now let's talk about these family members on Language Takeaway.
好的，现在让我们在Language Takeaway中谈谈这些家庭成员。

27
Language Takeaway So, Marco, we've got four family members to talk about today.
Language Takeaway 所以，Marco，今天我们要谈论四个家庭成员。

28
And the first one is brother-in-law.
第一个是姐夫。

29
Right, so we have the word brother-in-law.
对，所以我们有姐夫这个词。

30
So basically this person is married to your sister.
基本上，这个人是你姐姐的丈夫。

31
That's right, so I have a brother, I have a sister, but when these people marry, they marry someone who I'm not related to by blood.
没错，我有一个兄弟，我有一个姐妹，但当这些人结婚时，他们会嫁给我没有血缘关系的人。

32
We call them in-laws, so brother-in-law, sister-in-law.
我们称他们为姻亲，所以姐夫、嫂子。

33
Right, so that's exactly it.
对，这正是如此。

34
The key there is that when it has the ending in-law, it means that you're not related to them by blood.
关键在于，当它以-in-law结尾时，意味着你与他们没有血缘关系。

35
It's your extended family because of marriage.
这是因为婚姻而形成的扩展家庭。

36
That's right, so I have a younger brother.
没错，所以我有一个弟弟。

37
When he gets married, I will have a sister-in-law.
当他结婚时，我将有一个嫂子。

38
That's right, and it applies to, for example, father-in-law.
没错，这也适用于，例如，岳父。

39
That would be your husband's dad or mother-in-law would be your husband's mother.
那是你丈夫的父亲，或岳母是你丈夫的母亲。

40
Yeah, so these are all related to you by marriage.
是的，这些都是通过婚姻与你相关的。

41
Alright, so now moving on to the next type of extended family member that we have is a stepson.
好的，现在我们要谈论的下一个扩展家庭成员是继子。

42
Your uncle has a stepson.
你的叔叔有一个继子。

43
So a stepson.
所以继子。

44
Now this can get very confusing.
这可能会变得非常混乱。

45
Let's take a simple, simple family.
让我们以一个简单的家庭为例。

46
We have two people and they're married, but they get divorced.
我们有两个人，他们结婚，但后来离婚。

47
So they split up.
所以他们分开了。

48
And now maybe they had some kids, the wife has kids, and she gets married to someone else.
现在也许他们有一些孩子，妻子有孩子，她嫁给了其他人。

49
So her new husband calls her son his stepson.
所以她的新丈夫称她的儿子为继子。

50
Because it's not his son, it's another man's son.
因为这不是他的儿子，而是另一个男人的儿子。

51
But they're still related by marriage.
但他们仍然通过婚姻相关。

52
So when your new husband or your new wife has kids from another marriage, they're called stepson, stepdaughter.
所以当你新的丈夫或妻子有来自其他婚姻的孩子时，他们被称为继子、继女。

53
That's right.
没错。

54
So it's the same thing as if my mother got divorced and she remarried, she has a new husband.
所以这就像我母亲离婚后再婚，她有一个新丈夫。

55
That man would be my stepfather.
那个男人将是我的继父。

56
Alright, so these are all family members.
好的，这些都是家庭成员。

57
When you hear the word step, family members that we have because of divorce.
当你听到“继”这个词时，指的是因为离婚而形成的家庭成员。

58
So stepson, stepdaughter, stepfather, stepmother.
所以继子、继女、继父、继母。

59
And now, again, related to the whole divorce thing, the person that you get divorced to is called an ex-wife or an ex-husband.
现在，再次与离婚相关，你离婚的那个人被称为前妻或前夫。

60
Alright, so ex, like ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend means previous.
好的，所以“前”，像前女友或前男友，意味着以前的。

61
So my ex-wife is someone I was married to before, or in the case of a woman, my ex-husband was someone I was married to before, but we got divorced, so we're not married now.
所以我的前妻是我之前结婚的人，或者在女性的情况下，我的前夫是我之前结婚的人，但我们离婚了，所以我们现在不再结婚。

62
That's exactly it.
正是如此。

63
So it only applies to husband and wife, right?
所以这只适用于丈夫和妻子，对吧？

64
You don't say my ex-children or my ex-mother-in-law.
你不会说我的前孩子或我的前岳母。

65
Well, because your children are always your children.
嗯，因为你的孩子永远是你的孩子。

66
Exactly.
正是如此。

67
If you talk about your ex-wife's parents, you just say my ex-wife's father or my ex-wife's mother because there's no more in-law, there's no law, you're not married.
如果你谈论你前妻的父母，你只需说我前妻的父亲或我前妻的母亲，因为没有更多的姻亲，没有法律关系，你们不再结婚。

68
Right, okay.
对，好的。

69
And lastly, now we have an uncle, but just not any uncle, we have our great-uncle.
最后，我们有一个叔叔，但不是任何叔叔，而是我们的外曾叔。

70
Great-uncle, so they actually explain this in the dialogue.
外曾叔，所以他们在对话中实际上解释了这一点。

71
They say, he is my grandmother's brother.
他们说，他是我祖母的兄弟。

72
Right.
对。

73
Okay, so my uncle, this is simple, my uncle is my mother's brother or my father's brother, easy.
好的，我的叔叔，这很简单，我的叔叔是我母亲的兄弟或我父亲的兄弟，很简单。

74
But my great-uncle is one of my grandparents' brothers.
但我的外曾叔是我祖父母的兄弟之一。

75
Right.
对。

76
So my grandmother's brother or my grandfather's brother.
所以我祖母的兄弟或我祖父的兄弟。

77
Right.
对。

78
In English, we don't distinguish, we don't say a different word for grandmother's brother or grandfather's brother.
在英语中，我们不区分，我们不为祖母的兄弟或祖父的兄弟说不同的词。

79
Right, right, exactly.
对，没错。

80
So your great-uncle could be either your grandmother's brother or your grandfather's brother.
所以你的外曾叔可以是你祖母的兄弟或你祖父的兄弟。

81
That's right.
没错。

82
So in my family, I have...
所以在我的家庭中，我有...

83
Well, I just have one great-uncle and one great-aunt.
嗯，我只有一个外曾叔和一个外曾姑。

84
My grandmother has a sister, so I have a great-aunt, and my grandfather has a brother, so I have a great-uncle.
我祖母有一个姐妹，所以我有一个外曾姑，我祖父有一个兄弟，所以我有一个外曾叔。

85
And now the prefix great can also be applied, for example, to grandparents.
现在前缀“外”也可以应用于，例如，祖父母。

86
So you can say my great-grandfather.
所以你可以说我的外曾祖父。

87
That's right.
没错。

88
So we're talking about generations.
所以我们在谈论世代。

89
I have a grandfather, but his father is my great-grandfather.
我有一个祖父，但他的父亲是我的外曾祖父。

90
That means we go back in the past, one more generation.
这意味着我们回到过去，再多一代。

91
That's right.
没错。

92
All right, so let's take a break and let's listen to the dialogue again.

112
Right, so as you notice, we say a get-together, meaning that get-together, we are taking it as a noun.
对，所以你注意到，我们说聚会，意思是我们把聚会当作名词。

113
And it may be confusing because you see the verb get, right?
这可能会让人困惑，因为你看到动词“get”，对吧？

124
And when we were asking about the get-together, we asked if it's a family thing or is it just friends?

129

182
But I would like to add that with stepson, stepdaughter, it's not just divorce that we have this.
但我想补充的是，继子、继女，不仅仅是离婚才有这种情况。

183
Also, if the parent, maybe the mother dies, and the father has a new wife, then the new wife can say, this is my stepson, this is my stepdaughter.

The baby, boy or girl, is my half-brother or half-sister because we share one parent, my father.
这个孩子，无论是男孩还是女孩，都是我的异父兄弟或异母姐妹，因为我们共享一个父母，我的父亲。

190
Right, this is very interesting.
对，这非常有趣。

191
So if you do have a brother or sister that is not from your same mother or father, but just one parent, then yeah, it's called a half-brother or sister.
所以如果你有一个兄弟或姐妹，不是来自同一个父母，而是只有一个父母，那么是的，称为异父兄弟或异母姐妹。

192
Half, remember this, half because half of their parents are the same as your parents, maybe one father or mother.
半，记住这一点，半是因为他们的父母中有一半和你的父母相同，可能是一个父亲或母亲。

193
But with stepbrothers and stepsisters, the only reason you're related is because of marriage, not because of blood.
但对于继兄弟和继姐妹，你们之间的关系仅仅是因为婚姻，而不是血缘关系。

194
We didn't mention that you could have a stepbrother.
我们没有提到你可以有一个继兄弟。

195
So it's your brother, but he's legally your brother, but he's not related to your father or anyone in your family.
所以他是你的兄弟，但他在法律上是你的兄弟，但他和你的父亲或你家里的任何人没有关系。

196
That's right, that's right.

197
So maybe you have many stepbrothers.

198
You could have a stepbrother and a half-brother.

199
So there are lots of different combinations because of many different reasons.
