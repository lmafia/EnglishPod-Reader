我叫Catherine，今天我们为您准备了一节初级课程。

4
This is about fixing things.
这节课是关于修理东西的。

5
That's right.
没错。

6
So sometimes in our office or in our house, some small things may break, like maybe the door or the air conditioning.
有时候在我们的办公室或家里，一些小东西可能会坏掉，比如门或空调。

7
So in this case, we need to call a special guy to come and fix it.
在这种情况下，我们需要叫一个专业的人来修理。

8
So let's listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about who this guy is.
让我们来听今天的对话，稍后我们会回来讨论这个人是谁。

9
The air conditioning is not working.

10
We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here.
我们需要在这里开始受热之前叫个修理工。

11
Dan is on top of that.
Dan正在处理这件事。

12
I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up.
我想他们还让修理工修理那个总是堵塞的卫生间马桶。

13
That would be convenient.
那样就方便了。

14
They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring.
他们还可以让他修理电线。

15
The circuit breakers keep going out all the time.
断路器总是跳闸。

16
It's really annoying.
这真的很烦人。

17
Yeah, you're right.
是的，你说得对。

18
This office is falling apart.
这个办公室快要垮了。

19
Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged, and that's why the parking lot was flooded.
Frank前几天告诉我，外面的排水沟堵了，这就是停车场被淹的原因。

20
I know.
我知道。

21
I was in ankle-deep water trying to get to my car that day.
那天我在脚踝深的水中试图到我的车。

22
The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.
修理工肯定有很多工作要做。

23
All right, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

24
So now let's take a look at some of those keywords and phrases on language takeaway.
现在让我们看看一些关键词和短语的语言要点。

25
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

26
Our first word today is the name of this job.
我们今天的第一个词是这个工作的名称。

27
The person is called a handyman.
这个人叫做修理工。

28
Okay, so that's a profession.
好的，这是一种职业。

29
You are a handyman.
你是一个修理工。

30
Now what exactly does a handyman do?
那么修理工到底做什么呢？

31
Well, a handyman fixes things.
嗯，修理工修理东西。

32
He is usually a generalist.
他通常是个通才。

33
You know, he fixes things all over the house, not just the bathroom or the kitchen.
你知道，他修理房子里各处的东西，不仅仅是卫生间或厨房。

34
So he can just fix things that are a little bit broken.
所以他可以修理一些稍微坏掉的东西。

35
But if, for example, your car needs a new radiator or needs a new important part, maybe you would take the car to someone who is more experienced with cars.
但如果，比如说，你的车需要一个新的散热器或重要部件，可能你会把车送到一个更有经验的人那里。

36
But in the case of a handyman, if anything's broken, he can generally fix it.
但在修理工的情况下，如果有什么坏了，他通常可以修好。

37
Okay, so as Catherine explained, basically a handyman just does any type or many types of general work of things that may be broken around the house or the office.
好的，正如Catherine所解释的，基本上修理工就是做任何类型或多种类型的常规工作，修理家里或办公室可能坏掉的东西。

38
We had a couple examples of these in today's dialogue, didn't we?
我们在今天的对话中有几个例子，不是吗？

39
What was that first one?
第一个是什么？

40
Kind of gross.
有点恶心。

41
Yeah, well, he had to fix the air conditioning, but then he also had to fix the bathroom toilet because it kept clogging up.
是的，他必须修理空调，但他还得修理那个总是堵塞的卫生间马桶。

42
Okay, so a toilet gets clogged up.
好的，马桶堵了。

43
To clog up.
堵塞。

44
What does this mean?
这是什么意思？

45
So it means that something is blocking the way of, you know, the water being able to go out.
这意味着有东西阻挡了水的流出。

46
So the water doesn't go down.
所以水下不去。

47
Right.
对。

48
And sometimes if the toilet is really clogged and someone tries to flush the toilet again, the water comes onto the floor and it's very dirty and very gross.
有时候如果马桶真的堵了，有人再冲水，水就会溢到地上，非常脏，非常恶心。

49
That's right.
没错。

50
So actually, maybe sometimes in the kitchen, pieces of food may fall into the sink and it may clog up the sink.
所以实际上，有时候在厨房，食物的碎片可能掉进水槽，可能会堵塞水槽。

51
Okay, so to clog up means to block or to get in the way of.
好的，所以堵塞意味着阻挡或妨碍。

52
That's right.
没错。

53
And apart from the toilets being clogged up, he also may have to take a look at the circuit breakers.
除了马桶堵塞，他还可能需要检查断路器。

54
All right, so this is not about water or about plumbing.
好的，这不是关于水或管道的。

55
Circuit breakers have to do with electricity.
断路器与电有关。

56
And in this case, that box in your apartment or near your apartment that controls the different circuits.
在这种情况下，就是你公寓里或附近控制不同电路的那个盒子。

57
So sometimes if the lights go out, you know that you have to check the circuit breaker and make sure that the circuits are all working properly.
所以有时候如果灯熄灭了，你知道你需要检查断路器，确保所有电路都正常工作。

58
That's right.
没错。

59
So the circuit breakers are kind of like a protection from too much electricity and that's why they go out.
所以断路器有点像是过多电流的保护，这就是它们跳闸的原因。

60
And now for our final word on language takeaway, something that also got clogged up at their office.
现在我们最后一个语言要点是他们办公室里也堵塞的东西。

61
We're talking about the gutters.
我们在谈论排水沟。

62
All right, so many people's houses have gutters or sometimes an office building will have gutters.
好的，许多人的房子都有排水沟，或者有时办公楼也会有排水沟。

63
These are trays on the roof of a house or a building that will catch the water when it rains.
这些是房子或建筑物屋顶上的托盘，用来收集雨水。

64
Because, you know, sometimes rainwater can be very, very heavy.
因为你知道，有时候雨水可能非常非常重。

65
And it's dangerous on your house, on the roof of your house, because it can hurt the roof.
这对你的房子，屋顶来说是危险的，因为它可能会损坏屋顶。

66
But if it comes into this gutter, into this little tray, then it will come down and fall on the ground.
但如果它进入这个排水沟，这个小托盘，那么它就会下来，落到地上。

67
So these are a way to protect your roof.
所以这些是保护你屋顶的一种方式。

68
But these often get clogged up with leaves and with garbage.
但这些通常会被树叶和垃圾堵塞。

69
That's right.
没错。

70
So they're like small little ways or little roads, if you want to call them, where the water can go and escape and go into a specific place.
所以它们就像小小的通道，或者如果你想称之为小路，水可以通过并逃到特定的地方。

71
We have them on the sides of roads as well many times.
我们在路边也经常看到它们。

72
So gutters that you find on the ground, sometimes you find them on the roof of a house, but those are a little bit different.
所以在地面上的排水沟，有时你会在房子的屋顶上找到，但那些稍微不同。

73
The gutters on the ground are basically pathways for water to come down.
地面的排水沟基本上是水下来的通道。

74
Because if there's no gutter, then all of the water is on the road and it can flood very quickly.
因为如果没有排水沟，所有的水都会在路上，很快就会淹水。

75
That's right.
没错。

76
And so this is a way for the water and even the garbage to go on the side of the road and not be in the way of the cars.
所以这是一种让水甚至垃圾在路边流动，而不妨碍汽车的方式。

77
That's right.
没错。

78
You see them on highways and roads very often because you don't want the road filled with water.
你在高速公路和道路上经常看到它们，因为你不想让路上满是水。

79
So these gutters are a small path where all the water will fall into it and escape safely from the highway.
所以这些排水沟是一个小路径，所有的水都会流入并安全地逃离高速公路。

80
That's right.
没错。

81
All right.
好的。

82
So that's all the time we have for language takeaway.
所以这就是我们语言要点的所有时间。

83

我们听说丹在处理这个。

103
All right, so we need to call a handyman in here and he says, nope, Dan is on top of that.
好吧，所以我们需要叫一个修理工进来，他说，不，丹在处理这个。

104
So to be on top of something, what does it mean?
那么，"在某事上处于领先地位"是什么意思？

105
Well, when she says Dan is on top of that, she's basically saying Dan is taking care of this or Dan is already calling the handyman to come and fix it.

120
And the person said, well, they might as well ask the handyman to also fix the electrical wiring.
那个人说，好吧，他们不妨让修理工也修理电线。

121
Okay, so this phrase might as well is it's kind of hard to understand, I think sometimes.
好的，所以这个短语"不妨"有时有点难以理解。

122
Basically, what the speaker is saying is that while he is doing this, he can also do something else.
基本上，发言者是在说，当他在做这个时，他也可以做其他事情。

185
It's actually a trade.

It's a very weird word, though, because shoes and cobbler don't seem to have much to do with each other.
