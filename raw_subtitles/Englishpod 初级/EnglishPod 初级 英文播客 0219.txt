You would think that this is about bathing the baby, about giving the baby a bath.

55
Now, who wants to guess when the baby is due?
现在，谁想猜一下婴儿的预产期？

56
Um, I think my water just broke.

57
Get me to a hospital!

58
All right, so, very interesting.
好的，非常有趣。

59
All the gifts that they got and definitely very useful because this is a very common items that you get for babies, right?
所有的礼物都很棒，绝对非常实用，因为这些是你为婴儿准备的非常常见的物品，对吧？

60
That's right.
没错。

61
All of this stuff is really, really valuable because if you have a baby or if your brother or sister has a baby, you'll notice that these are very common items.
所有这些东西都非常有价值，因为如果你有一个婴儿，或者你的兄弟姐妹有一个婴儿，你会发现这些都是非常常见的物品。

62
So, let's go through a couple of them in today's language takeaway.
所以，让我们在今天的语言收获中看看其中几个。

63
Language takeaway.
语言收获。

64
Okay, so, the first word that we're gonna take a look at, the most common one and useful one for a baby is a bib.
好的，首先我们要看的词是，最常见和最实用的婴儿用品是围嘴。

65
Bib.
围嘴。

66
So, babies are messy.
所以，婴儿吃东西时会弄得很脏。

67
When they eat food, they get their food on their clothes.
当他们吃食物时，食物会弄到他们的衣服上。

68
So, to protect the clothes, babies wear bibs.
所以，为了保护衣服，婴儿会戴围嘴。

69
This is a piece of cloth or fabric around their neck.
这是一块围在他们脖子上的布或织物。

70
Okay, a bib.
好的，围嘴。

71
And also, sometimes you want to go out with your baby to the mall, you're walking and you don't want to carry him in your arms all the time.
有时你想带着婴儿去商场，你走路时不想一直抱着他。

72
So, you need a stroller.
所以，你需要一个婴儿车。

73
Okay, so, basically a stroller is a chair on wheels for a baby.
好的，基本上婴儿车是一个有轮子的婴儿椅。

74
Babies are heavy and as they get older, they get heavier and so this is a way to push the baby around, not carry the baby.
婴儿很重，随着他们长大，他们会变得更重，所以这是一种推着婴儿，而不是抱着婴儿的方式。

75
Right, and maybe the baby falls asleep so they can fall asleep on the stroller.
对，可能婴儿会在婴儿车上睡着。

76
Exactly.
正是如此。

77
Okay, and while talking about chairs, we're gonna take a look at two different types of chairs.
好的，谈到椅子，我们要看看两种不同类型的椅子。

78
First one is a high chair.
第一种是高椅。

79
Okay, a high chair, think about the word high, that means tall in this case.
好的，高椅，想想“高”这个词，在这里意味着高。

80
A high chair is a chair for babies at the table.
高椅是给婴儿在桌子旁的椅子。

81
So, if you put a baby on a regular chair, they can't eat with adults.
所以，如果你把婴儿放在普通椅子上，他们不能和成年人一起吃饭。

82
They're too small.
他们太小了。

83
So, we give them high chairs so that they can sit a little bit higher and they can be at the table with adults.
所以，我们给他们高椅，这样他们就可以坐得高一点，和成年人一起在桌子旁。

84
Exactly.
正是如此。

85
So, they're very common.
所以，它们非常常见。

86
For example, you go to a restaurant, they will have a little high chairs if you have a baby or a small child.
例如，你去餐厅，他们会有小高椅，如果你有婴儿或小孩。

87
So, if you're at a restaurant, you have a baby, you ask for a high chair.
所以，如果你在餐厅里，有婴儿，你可以要求一个高椅。

88
You say, do you have a high chair please?
你可以说，您有高椅吗？

89
Yeah, perfect.
是的，完美。

90
And, well, if you're going to the restaurant or you go anywhere in your car, you need to have the baby be safe and obviously they can't fit on a normal, you know, seat.
而且，如果你去餐厅或在车里去任何地方，你需要确保婴儿安全，显然他们不能坐在普通的座位上。

91
No, with the seat belt.
不，带安全带。

92
No, I don't think so.
不，我不认为。

93
So, that's why you get them a car seat.
所以，这就是为什么你要给他们一个汽车座椅。

94
Okay, a car seat is a special chair that goes on the seat of the car and usually it's very, very safe.
好的，汽车座椅是一个特殊的椅子，放在汽车的座位上，通常非常安全。

95
It's made to protect the baby.
它是为了保护婴儿而设计的。

96
Right.
对。

97
So, if you are ever in a car accident, the car seat will help protect the small baby.
所以，如果你在车祸中，汽车座椅会帮助保护小婴儿。

98
Right, and car seats are supposed to go in the back of the car, not the front.
对，汽车座椅应该放在车的后面，而不是前面。

99
Yes, always.
是的，永远如此。

100
Very good.
非常好。

101
And now, moving on to our last two words.
现在，继续我们的最后两个词。

102
If you're at home, you sometimes want to have the baby play and you get him a playpen.
如果你在家，有时你想让宝宝玩，你给他一个游戏围栏。

103
So, basically, this is a way for parents to leave the baby playing but not look at the baby the whole time.
所以，基本上，这是一种让父母可以让宝宝玩，但不需要一直看着宝宝的方式。

104
Right.
对。

105
A playpen is like a cage for a baby but it's soft and it's cute and it's pretty and so it's basically like an open area that's protected on the sides and the baby can go inside but the baby can't leave.
游戏围栏就像是一个宝宝的笼子，但它是软的、可爱的、漂亮的，所以基本上就像一个四周被保护的开放区域，宝宝可以进去，但宝宝不能出来。

106
Right, it's like a cage basically and it has little toys and that's the way you just keep them in there.
对，基本上就像一个笼子，里面有小玩具，这样你就可以把他们留在里面。

107
Exactly.
正是如此。

108
Alright, and now when you want to put the baby to sleep, it can't obviously sleep in a big bed because it might roll over, it might fall off.
好的，现在当你想让宝宝睡觉时，显然不能让他在大床上睡，因为他可能会翻身，可能会掉下去。

109
There's a lot of things that can go wrong so you get them a crib.
有很多事情可能出错，所以你给他们一个婴儿床。

110
Right, so a crib is a bed for babies.
对，所以婴儿床是给宝宝的床。

111
This is usually high off the ground and it's usually quite small and the baby can't climb out of it.
这通常离地面很高，而且通常很小，宝宝不能爬出来。

112
Right.
对。

113
Yeah.
是的。

114
So it's a very safe bed so the baby can't fall out, can't climb out.
所以这是一个非常安全的床，宝宝不能掉出来，不能爬出来。

115
Exactly.
正是如此。

116
Very good.
非常好。

117
So very interesting, very useful things for you if you're having a baby, planning on getting these things.
所以如果你要有宝宝，计划购买这些东西，非常有趣，非常有用。

118
So why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.
那我们为什么不回去，再听一遍对话，然后我们会回来进行流利度训练。

119

143
So now let's take a look at two key phrases.

144
Fluency Builder.
流利度训练。

145
Okay, so at the beginning of the dialogue, the woman receives a bib for the baby and she says, This will definitely come in handy.
好的，在对话开始时，女人收到了一个宝宝的围嘴，她说，这肯定会派上用场。

146
To come in handy.
派上用场。

147
Right, so when something comes in handy, it means it will be useful.
对，所以当某样东西派上用场时，意味着它会有用。

148
Okay, so something that's handy is useful.
好的，所以有用的东西就是有用的。

149
To come in handy means to be useful.
派上用场意味着有用。

150
It will be useful in the future.
它将来会有用。

151
So, for example, you should take a flashlight with you in the car, just in case, because it could come in handy.
例如，你应该在车里带一个手电筒，以防万一，因为它可能会派上用场。

152
That's right.
没错。

153
Or, if I know that Marco is traveling to India, I can give him a map of India.
或者，如果我知道马尔科要去印度旅行，我可以给他一张印度地图。

154
I say, Marco, this map might come in handy.
我说，马尔科，这张地图可能会派上用场。

155
Exactly.
正是如此。

156
Very good.
非常好。

157
So, to come in handy, or in something that is handy, something that's useful.
所以，派上用场，或者在某样东西是有用的。

158
And, towards the end, a very popular phrase.
然后，在最后，一个非常流行的短语。

159
You probably heard it in every movie that has, like, maybe a pregnant woman in there.

164
My water broke!
我的羊水破了！

165
Take me to the hospital!
带我去医院！

166

168
So, why do they say that the water broke?
所以，为什么他们说羊水破了？

169

172
It's not just water, it's all sorts of, like, body fluids.
不仅仅是水，还有各种身体液体。

173
And, basically, when that breaks, it comes out and you know that you're going to have the baby.
基本上，当它破裂时，水就会流出来，你知道你要生宝宝了。

174
Because that means the baby has to come out now, because that protective fluid is gone.
因为这意味着宝宝现在必须出来，因为保护液体已经没有了。

175
Maybe the baby just kind of kicks that water out and is just like, I'm ready to come out.
也许宝宝只是踢掉那些水，像是，我准备出来了。

176
I have no idea how it works.

Alright,
好的，

205
so talking about baby things and baby showers, it's a very interesting tradition.
说到婴儿用品和婴儿派对，这是一种非常有趣的传统。

206
I understand that in other countries, they don't really celebrate baby showers like this.
我知道在其他国家，他们并不真的像这样庆祝婴儿派对。

207
Really?
真的？

208
Yeah, or that if they do, they do it in different ways.
是的，或者如果他们庆祝的话，他们会以不同的方式进行。

209
I know, for example, that sometimes in Latin American countries, they usually do it after the baby is born.
我知道，例如，在拉丁美洲国家，他们通常在宝宝出生后才举行。

210
Oh, so like a congratulations shower.
哦，所以像是祝贺派对。

211
Exactly, and then obviously you know if the baby was a boy or a girl, so then you get them like pink things or blue things, so it's a little bit more... That's what's really funny about these.
正是如此，然后显然你知道宝宝是男孩还是女孩，所以你会给他们买粉色或蓝色的东西，这样就更... 这就是这些的有趣之处。

212
People often want to have the surprise of not knowing if the baby will be a boy or a girl.
人们常常想要保持不知道宝宝性别的惊喜。

213
So when they have the baby shower, they say, oh, I don't know what the gender is.
所以当他们举行婴儿派对时，他们会说，哦，我不知道性别是什么。

214
And so you end up buying all of these yellow things, because yellow is neutral.
结果你买了很多黄色的东西，因为黄色是中性的。

215
It's good for boys and girls.
对男孩和女孩都适用。

216
I don't know how many yellow gifts I got.
我不知道我收到了多少黄色的礼物。

217
I think it's a very interesting thing, because for example, I know that in China, I think you can't ask the doctor for the gender of the baby before it's born, right?
我觉得这很有趣，因为例如，我知道在中国，我想你不能在宝宝出生前问医生性别，对吗？

218
I think that's a way to... I'm not sure if it's a rule or not, but it sounds right.
我觉得这是一种... 我不确定这是否是规则，但听起来是对的。

219
I mean, it's a way to protect female babies.
我的意思是，这是一种保护女婴的方式。

220
I think it would be always great to just have it be a surprise.
我觉得总是保持惊喜会很好。

221
You never know.
你永远不知道。

222
Yeah, just like, oh, you know, whatever comes out.
是的，就像，哦，随便出来什么。

223
Can you imagine not knowing, and then you have twins?
你能想象不知道，然后你有双胞胎吗？

224
That would be great for me, I think, if I had like a boy and a girl.
如果我有一个男孩和一个女孩，那对我来说会很棒。

225
Bam!
啪！

226
All at once.
一下子。

227
All at once, never have to worry about it again.
一下子，永远不必再担心了。

228
Exactly, and then you have the best of both worlds, right?
正是如此，然后你就得到了两全其美，对吧？

229
You're done.
你完成了。

230
All right, so very interesting topic.
好吧，非常有趣的话题。

231
Let us know if you have baby showers in your country, or how do you celebrate a baby's birth or before it's born.
