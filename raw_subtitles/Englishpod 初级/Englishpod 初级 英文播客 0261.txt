Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at five key words that we have to describe someone's face on Language Takeaway.
好吧，我们回来了，现在让我们看看在Language Takeaway中描述某人脸的五个关键词。

29
Language Takeaway.
Language Takeaway。

30
So we've got a couple words for noses here.
我们这里有几个关于鼻子的词。

31
They're adjectives to describe noses.
它们是描述鼻子的形容词。

32
The first one that we heard is Roman nose.
我们听到的第一个是罗马鼻。

33
Okay, so if someone has a Roman nose, does that mean they're from Rome?
好的，如果某人有罗马鼻，是否意味着他们来自罗马？

34
No, not quite.
不，没那么简单。

35
Well, Rome, as we know, is a city in Italy, but it's also an adjective here.
嗯，罗马，正如我们所知，是意大利的一个城市，但在这里也是一个形容词。

36
Roman means that the nose is straight on top.
罗马意味着鼻子在顶部是直的。

37
It's like a triangle.
它像一个三角形。

38
Okay, but it's kind of long.
好的，但它有点长。

39
You have kind of a long straight nose, right?
你有一个长直的鼻子，对吧？

40
That's right, a very long straight nose.
没错，非常长的直鼻子。

41
Okay, so we have Roman nose, somebody that has a long straight nose.
好的，所以我们有罗马鼻，指的是有一个长直鼻子的人。

42
Now what about a pointy nose?
那尖鼻子呢？

43
A pointy nose means that the tip of the nose is pointy, so maybe it goes up a little bit, goes down and then up, but usually that there's a point on the tip of the nose.
尖鼻子意味着鼻尖是尖的，可能稍微向上翘，向下再向上，但通常鼻尖有一个尖点。

44
Or sometimes the nose is very thin, right?
或者有时鼻子很细，对吧？

45
It's not very wide, so it looks very pointy.
它不宽，所以看起来很尖。

46
That's right, so it kind of gets very narrow at the end.
没错，所以它在末端变得很窄。

47
That's right.
没错。

48
Okay, and now maybe you broke your nose once, or you had an accident, and some people have a crooked nose.
好的，也许你曾经摔过鼻子，或者发生过事故，有些人有歪鼻子。

49
Yeah, a lot of very famous football players have crooked noses because, you know, you get hit in the face with the football and then your nose always has a bump.
是的，很多非常著名的足球运动员都有歪鼻子，因为你知道的，脸上被足球击中后，鼻子总是会有一个肿块。

50
Well, look, something is crooked if it's not straight.
嗯，看，某物是歪的，如果它不是直的。

51
So crooked is the opposite of a Roman nose or a straight nose.
所以歪是罗马鼻或直鼻的反义词。

52
That's right.
没错。

53
So maybe you see boxers also, I think, have crooked nose, most of them, or hockey players and stuff like that.
所以也许你看到拳击手，我认为他们大多数都有歪鼻，或者冰球运动员等等。

54
Yeah, they take a lot of hits to the face.
是的，他们的脸经常受到撞击。

55
Okay, so now moving on, we've described noses in many ways.
好的，现在继续，我们已经用很多方式描述了鼻子。

56
You can say long nose, short nose, or whatever, but this is another way of doing it.
你可以说长鼻子，短鼻子，或者其他，但这是一种不同的描述方式。

57
And what about eyebrows?
那眉毛呢？

58
Okay, eyebrows are those lines of hair above your eyes, and some people have really thick eyebrows, some people have very thin eyebrows, but if someone has thick eyebrows, lots of hair, we call them bushy eyebrows.
好的，眉毛是你眼睛上方的那条毛发，有些人有非常浓密的眉毛，有些人有非常细的眉毛，但如果某人有浓密的眉毛，很多毛发，我们称之为浓眉。

59
Okay, so if you have bushy eyebrows, it means that you have a lot of hair on, as you said, your eyebrows or over your eye.
好的，如果你有浓眉，意味着你在眉毛或眼睛上方有很多毛发。

60
Okay, and now this is a really, I think, kind of a nice feature that some people have.
好的，现在这是一个我认为很不错的特征，有些人有。

61
On their pimples, not many people have them, but these are two little dots, little indentations that appear when a person smiles.
在他们的酒窝上，并不是很多人都有，但这是两个小点，小凹陷，当一个人微笑时出现。

62
That's right.
没错。

63
So maybe you've seen this, or maybe you have this, or a friend has this, somebody smiles, and on their cheeks, towards the middle of the cheek, they have little holes that form, that look like, I don't know, like somebody kind of pinched it with a needle.
所以也许你见过这个，或者你有这个，或者朋友有这个，某人微笑时，他们的脸颊中间有小洞，像是被针戳了一样。

64
Yeah, like it goes down a little bit for some reason.
是的，像是出于某种原因稍微凹下去。

65
It's like, yeah, they're being pinched inside their cheek.

Okay, we heard that in the dialogue.

102
Think about a sunken ship.

104
So someone with sunken eyes probably has dark rings under their eyes because their eyes are so deep in their head.
所以有深陷眼睛的人可能在眼睛下方有黑眼圈，因为他们的眼睛深陷在头里。

105
That's right.
没错。

106
Now I guess the opposite.

145
And that's usually just little spots but of just different color on your skin.
这通常只是皮肤上不同颜色的小斑点。

146
So usually people that have maybe red hair, you know, they have freckles.

好吧，所以秃头意味着头上没有头发。

175
Right.
对。

176
Now sometimes, naturally, people become bald.
现在有时，自然情况下，人们会变得秃头。

177
Hair falls off as the years go by, and no more hair grows on their head.

Because maybe their hair grows a little bit further back, and other people have smaller foreheads that you almost can't even really see.

223
Or sometimes they just hide it with their hair.
