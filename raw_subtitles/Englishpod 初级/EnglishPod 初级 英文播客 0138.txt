Well, we've got a little bit of a Seinfeld situation.
我们有点像《宋飞正传》的情景。

8
So, for those of you who are not familiar with this American TV show, which, by the way, is one of my favorites, Seinfeld is a TV show, a comedy, about very awkward, very common situations that are taken to the extreme.
对于那些不熟悉这个美国电视节目的朋友来说，顺便说一句，这是我最喜欢的节目之一，《宋飞正传》是一部关于非常尴尬、非常普通的情境被推向极端的喜剧。

Right, so it's a very popular show.
对，所以这是个非常受欢迎的节目。

12
No, you have to see them in reruns.

Reruns, right.

So, we have a situation that's very common, and it was pretty funny on the show.

It's a guy trying to rent a car.

51
But this guy does, so let's take a look at the language takeaway to find out what are some of the words we're using here to describe renting a car, and what kind of car we're talking about.
但这个人却生气了，所以让我们看看语言要点，找出我们在这里用来描述租车的词汇，以及我们在谈论什么样的车。

52
Language takeaway Well, as you mentioned, at rental places, they have different size cars, right?
语言要点 嗯，正如你提到的，在租车的地方，他们有不同尺寸的车，对吧？

Different size vehicles.

Starting with the cheapest one, the least expensive and the smallest, it's a compact vehicle.
从最便宜、最小的开始，是紧凑型车。

Small.

61
Right, so compact car you're going to hear very often, even if you're buying a car.
对，所以你会经常听到紧凑型车，即使你在买车。

62
Let's think of an... what's a compact car?
让我们想想... 什么是紧凑型车？

63
The VW Golf is a compact car, very small car.
大众高尔夫是一辆紧凑型车，非常小的车。

64
So, usually it's two doors, or if it's a four-door car, it's very small.
所以，通常是两厢车，或者如果是四厢车，也非常小。

65
Not very long, right?
不会很长，对吧？

66
Right, exactly.
对，正是如此。

67
So, maybe like a Ford Focus could be a small car, compact.
所以，像福特福克斯可能是一辆小车，紧凑型。

68
Now, moving up in size a little bit, we would have a mid-size vehicle.
现在，稍微大一点的车，我们会有中型车。

69
Okay, mid-size vehicle is... well, it's a giveaway here because mid means middle.
好吧，中型车是... 嗯，这里有个提示，因为中间的意思是中间。

70
So, it's kind of in the middle between the small and the large.
所以，它在小型车和大型车之间。

71
And this is your average four-door sedan car.
这就是你普通的四厢轿车。

72
Okay, so as an example, you would have a Ford Taurus or maybe a Toyota Camry.
好吧，作为例子，你可以有福特金牛座或丰田凯美瑞。

73
Yeah, Toyota Camry is maybe the most common car.
是的，丰田凯美瑞可能是最常见的车。

74
It's kind of expensive, but it's still mid-size, right?

82
People are not driving their SUVs anymore.

214

你最好给我保险。

215
But the grammatically correct way would be... You had better.
但语法上正确的方式是... 你最好。

So remember that here we've got the grammatically correct form that you should write, you'd better, or the spoken form, you better.
所以记住这里我们有你应该写的语法正确形式，你最好，或者口语形式，你最好。

223
You better.
你最好。

224
I think in this one we should also listen to some other examples to get a better idea of how we can use this very strong suggestion.

233
Okay, so this is future, I'm going to, I'm gonna beat the hell out of this car.
好的，所以这是将来，我要，我要把这辆车打得稀巴烂。

234
So this is very strong, right?
所以这非常强烈，对吧？

235
Yeah, it's very strong and he's saying he is going to destroy the car.
是的，非常强烈，他说他要毁掉这辆车。

236
So beat the hell out of, so that means really just do damage to something.
所以打得稀巴烂，这意味着真的对某样东西造成伤害。

237
So you can use it out towards a person also, it's like, I'm going to beat the hell out of you.
所以你也可以用它对一个人说，就像，我要把你打得稀巴烂。

238
And I'll arrest you for violence.
我会因为暴力逮捕你。

239
Right, so it's a very strong phrase.
对，所以这是一个非常强烈的短语。

240
It shows anger, it shows that you are threatening somebody, so it's not, obviously it's not polite.
它显示愤怒，显示你在威胁某人，所以显然这不是礼貌的。

241
And it might get you a broken nose in a bar if you ever say this to someone or about someone, so be very careful.
如果你对某人或关于某人说这个，可能会在酒吧里被打断鼻子，所以要非常小心。

242
Right, but you can use it to describe a situation, right?
对，但你可以用它来描述一个情况，对吧？

243
He's like, yeah, we went to a bar yesterday and Dan beat the hell out of the bartender.
他就像，是的，我们昨天去酒吧，丹把酒保打得稀巴烂。

244
So instead of just saying Dan hit the bartender or Dan got into a fight, you're saying he hit him and he just... And he kept hitting him and kept hitting him and kept hitting him, so yeah, he beat the hell out of him.
所以与其说丹打了酒保或者丹打架，不如说他打了他，而且他一直打他，一直打他，一直打他，所以是的，他把他打得稀巴烂。

245
Alright, great, so those are the phrases and words that we wanted to talk about today.
好的，很好，所以这些是我们今天想谈的短语和单词。

246
But I think it'd be good if we listened to this dialogue one more time just to get a good feel for it.
但我认为如果我们再听一遍这个对话会很好，以便更好地感受它。

247
When we come back, we'll be talking a little bit more about the process of renting a car.

274
You can rent like a Porsche or a Lamborghini or a Ferrari.

Yeah, so I think the insurance premiums on those particular cars are very high though, so you're not only paying for the car, but you're also paying for the insurance and possibly the speeding tickets.
是的，所以我认为这些特定车辆的保险费用非常高，所以你不仅要为车付钱，还要为保险和可能的超速罚单付钱。

I can't imagine renting one of those cars and not getting a speeding ticket.
