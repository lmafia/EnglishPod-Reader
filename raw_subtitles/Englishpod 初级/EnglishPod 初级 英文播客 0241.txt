120
Fluency Builder.

121
So Rebecca's talking about her father and her friends, and she says she's a bookworm, but her father always pushed us, that means her and her family members, her siblings, to succeed.
所以丽贝卡谈到了她的父亲和朋友，她说她是个书呆子，但她的父亲总是推动我们，也就是她和她的家人、兄弟姐妹，去取得成功。

122
And this verb, to push us, to push someone, is very important because it's not the same as to push a door.
而这个动词，推动我们，推动某人，非常重要，因为这与推门不同。

123
Right, so it's not physically that you're pushing somebody.
对，所以并不是在物理上推某人。

124
It's actually to motivate somebody or to inspire someone to become better at something.
实际上是激励某人或启发某人变得更好。

125
That's right.
没错。

126
So to push someone is to encourage them to do something bad.
所以推动某人是鼓励他们做一些不好的事情。

127
It's not always a good thing.
这并不总是好事。

128
So she was always pushing me to do what she wanted to do, not what I wanted to do.

That means someone's always trying to influence you or to get you to do something.
这意味着某人总是在试图影响你或让你做某事。

Exactly.
正是如此。

So as you say, to push someone is to influence them, to motivate them, to encourage them to do something good or bad.
所以正如你所说，推动某人是影响他们，激励他们，鼓励他们做一些好或坏的事情。

132
Well, and Mr. Parsons agreed with her dad's encouragement, and he said, well, it really paid off.
嗯，帕森斯先生同意她父亲的鼓励，他说，嗯，这确实得到了回报。

133
Okay, this is a great verbal phrase, to pay off.

134
This means to have benefits.

136
So you can see the results.

138
It paid off.

143
And well, when she was talking about extracurricular activities, she said she was always keen on writing.
而且，当她谈到课外活动时，她说她一直热衷于写作。

144
Now, I think this is more common among British people to say you're keen on something, but it basically means to like.
现在，我认为这在英国人中更常见，说你对某事感兴趣，但这基本上意味着喜欢。

145
So remember the phrase keen on.

146
This is the preposition here, keen on.
这是这里的介词，热衷于。

147
I'm keen on writing.
我热衷于写作。

149
Yes, you can.
是的，可以。

150
That means you like someone, maybe romantically.
这意味着你喜欢某人，也许是浪漫的。

151
Okay, so it's kind of a, as Catherine said, more of a British thing, but it's correct and you can use it in replacement of to like.
好的，所以这有点像，正如凯瑟琳所说，更像是英国的说法，但这是正确的，你可以用它来替代喜欢。

152
I think it also sounds a little bit more formal.
我认为这听起来也更正式一些。

153
Instead of saying, well, I've always liked writing.
而不是说，嗯，我一直喜欢写作。

154
If she says, well, I've always been keen on writing.
如果她说，嗯，我一直热衷于写作。

155
I think it sounds nice.
我觉得这听起来不错。

161
It might be a little bit complicated to understand, but when she said that volunteering was very fulfilling and to be part of a group.
这可能有点复杂，但当她说志愿服务是非常有成就感的，成为一个团体的一部分。

162
Okay, fulfilling sounds a lot like the word filling, but you shouldn't confuse these two because the meaning is very different, right?
好的，有成就感听起来很像填充这个词，但你不应该混淆这两个，因为意义非常不同，对吧？

163
So something that is fulfilling makes you feel really good.
所以某些事情是有成就感的，会让你感觉很好。

164
You maybe, maybe you don't make money from it or you don't get a lot of praise from it, but it still makes you feel happy about life for yourself or something.
你可能，可能你没有从中赚钱，或者你没有得到很多赞扬，但它仍然让你对生活感到快乐。

165
So you get satisfaction.
所以你获得了满足感。

166
Now notice the pronunciation.
现在注意发音。

167
You don't say fulfilling.
你不说有成就感。

168
No, you say fulfilling.
不，你说有成就感。

169
Fulfilling.
有成就感。

170
So the L there is kind of silent.
所以那里的L有点是无声的。

171
Kind of optional, but maybe you could ask someone, what do you find fulfilling in your life?
有点可选，但也许你可以问某人，你在生活中发现什么是有成就感的？

172
Or you can ask, do you think your job is fulfilling?
或者你可以问，你认为你的工作是有成就感的吗？

173
Yeah.

175
So a lot of great words there.
