143
So I just, I like to think of a get together as something very casual, something very small, sometimes intimate, where you just have three or four or five friends.
我喜欢把聚会想象成非常随意的东西，非常小，有时是亲密的，只有三、四或五个朋友。

144
And it's, yeah, it's not as big as a party where everyone's dancing.
而且，是的，它没有像大家都在跳舞的派对那么大。

And like we said, it's a noun.

155
If you want to drop by.
如果你想来。

156
Okay.

157
This is something people often say in small talk because you don't want to say, you should come stay for a while because that's, I don't know.
这是人们在闲聊中常说的，因为你不想说，你应该来待一会儿，因为那样，我不知道。

158
They just met.
他们刚见面。

159
It's not in order.
这不合适。

160
Yeah.
是的。

161
So you should drop by means you should come and see and decide if you want to stay.
所以你应该来意味着你应该来看看，决定是否想留下。

162
So basically it's also kind of a relaxed way of saying you can come whenever you want during our party or our get together.
所以基本上这也是一种放松的方式，表示你可以在我们的聚会或小聚会期间随时来。

163
So if the get together is 9 PM to midnight, you can drop by whenever.
所以如果聚会是晚上9点到午夜，你可以随时来。

164
10 o'clock, 11 o'clock.
10点，11点。

165
So to drop by is to come for a short period.
所以来一下就是短暂地来。

166
So if we're talking on the phone and I say, I'll drop by your house later on today, that means I'm going to go to your house very quickly at an unexpected time.
所以如果我们在电话中，我说，我今天稍后会去你家，那意味着我会在一个意想不到的时间快速去你家。

167
Yeah.
是的。

168
Or you could use it in a question, you know, Marco, I really wanted to borrow that DVD.
或者你可以用它来提问，你知道，马尔科，我真的想借那张DVD。

169
When can I drop by to pick it up?

171

172
Now let's take a look at our last phrase.
现在让我们看看最后一个短语。

173
Michelle and James decided that they want to keep in touch.
米歇尔和詹姆斯决定保持联系。

174
And so he said, let me take down your number.
所以他说，让我记下你的号码。

175
Okay.
好的。

176
So we're not talking about taking it anywhere, taking a number anywhere and going somewhere.
所以我们不是在说把号码带到哪里，而是写下某些东西。

177
We're talking about writing something down.
所以在这种情况下，你的号码是你的电话号码。

178
So in this case, your number is your phone number.
好的。

179
Okay.
让我记下你的号码意味着让我写下你的电话号码。

180
Let me take down your number means let me write down your telephone number.
好的。

181
Okay.
所以这是一种说法，表示让我写下你的电话号码。

182
So it's another way of saying, let me write down your telephone number.
记下我的电话号码。

183
Take down my phone number.
稍后给我打电话。

184
Call me later.
没错。

185
That's right.
我可以记下你的号码，以便稍后给你打电话吗？

186
Can I take down your number so I can call you later?
这就是另一种问这个问题的方式。

187
That's another way of asking this question.
非常好。

188
Very good.

189
All right.
所以这就结束了流利构建。
