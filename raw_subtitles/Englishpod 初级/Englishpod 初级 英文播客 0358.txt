Today we're going to take a look at a lesson about technology and something that has become so popular and part of our everyday lives that it's necessary for us to acknowledge it in English.
今天我们将看看关于技术的课程，以及一些已经变得如此流行并成为我们日常生活一部分的内容，以至于我们有必要用英语来承认它。

7
That's right.

9
Something you can do and that many people often do on their cellular phones.
你可以在手机上做的事情，很多人经常这样做。

10
That's right.

11
So before we get into that, let's listen to the dialogue, try to understand what it's all about, and we'll be back in a bit.
在我们深入讨论之前，让我们听一下对话，试着理解它的内容，我们稍后会回来。

12
Alright, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

13
So now let's take a look at language takeaway.
现在让我们看看语言要点。

14
First up on language takeaway, we have the verb that is the focus of today's dialogue, to text.
首先在语言要点中，我们有今天对话的重点动词，发短信。

That's right.
没错。

16
So this is a verb in this case, to text.

18
Why didn't you text me?
你为什么不发短信给我？

21
Here it's a verb.
在这里它是一个动词。

22
It's a very new word as a verb from the last maybe 15 years or so with cell phones.
这是一个非常新的动词，大约在过去15年左右与手机一起出现。

23
So that's actually what it means is to send a text message via cell phone.

24
So you send a message.
所以你发送一条消息。

25
That's right.
没错。

30
It's very short and then you send it and the other person can read it.

31
Right.
对。

32
So instead of saying, why didn't you send me a text message last night, we just say, why didn't you text me?
所以与其说，为什么你昨晚不发我短信，我们只说，为什么你不发短信给我？

33
Alright, now another word that we often hear about texts is the noun messages or message.
好的，现在我们经常听到的另一个与短信相关的词是名词消息或信息。

34

35
That's right.

48
But then we can actually use the verb form as well.

所以我们可以说发短信，或者我们可以说发消息。

50
Why didn't you message me last night?
你昨晚为什么不发我消息？

51
That's right.

52
So this is more slang, to message someone, because text is very common and everyone uses it.
所以这更像是俚语，给某人发消息，因为发短信是非常常见的，大家都在用。

53
But normally young people say, hey, why didn't you message me?
但通常年轻人会说，嘿，你为什么不发我消息？

54

That's right.
没错。

60
Now if we see down towards the middle of the dialogue, we see that the person hates sending SMS messages.
现在如果我们看到对话中间，我们看到这个人讨厌发送短信。

61
So it's kind of explaining already what's been said, because you have SMS messages and this abbreviation stands for... Short Message Service.
所以这有点解释了已经说过的内容，因为你有短信，这个缩写代表... 短信服务。

62
Short S, Message M, Service S.
短信S，消息M，服务S。

63
So Short Message Service.
所以短信服务。

64
But most people around the world say SMS.
但世界上大多数人都说短信。

65
Right, so they say, oh, send me an SMS or send me an SMS message.
对，所以他们会说，哦，给我发一条短信或发我一条短信。

66
Which, again, like we see in the dialogue, it's kind of contradictory, because we're already saying Short Message Service, Message.
这再次像我们在对话中看到的，有点矛盾，因为我们已经在说短信服务，消息。

67
Yeah, but most people don't know what SMS means.
是的，但大多数人不知道短信是什么意思。

68
So they just say, hey, send me an SMS message or send me a text message.
所以他们只是说，嘿，给我发一条短信或发我一条短信。

69
Or, I didn't get your SMS.
或者，我没有收到你的短信。

70
That's right.
没错。

71
Now lastly, we didn't get the SMS because we didn't have any credit on the phone.
现在最后，我们没有收到短信，因为我们手机上没有任何余额。

72
Alright, now credit is an important word here.

73
It's a noun.

74
It's a thing.

75
We have credit or we don't have credit.

76
And it's important to remember that credit stands for money.
重要的是要记住，余额代表钱。

77
Alright, so maybe I buy $10 of credit for my cell phone.
好的，所以也许我为我的手机买了10美元的余额。

78
And that means I can send many, many messages.
这意味着我可以发送很多很多消息。

79
But when I have zero credit, I can't send any messages.
但当我没有余额时，我无法发送任何消息。

80
That's right.
没错。

81
So this is important because usually in many places, you have to have this amount of money in your phone in order to be able to talk and send messages.
所以这很重要，因为通常在许多地方，你必须在手机上有这笔钱才能打电话和发送消息。

82
So this money that you have is called credit.
所以你拥有的这笔钱叫做余额。

83
So you can say, I don't have any credit on my phone.
所以你可以说，我的手机上没有余额。

84
That's right.
没错。

85
And it's basically a way of having money without having real money.

86

206
It's especially very popular with the younger generation because it translates now to all sorts of messaging.
这在年轻一代中尤其流行，因为它现在适用于各种消息传递。

207
So before, as you say, it was because of the limitations, the amount of characters you could send in a message.
所以之前，正如你所说，是因为限制，消息中可以发送的字符数量。

208
But now it's just become something that people have gotten in the habit of doing.

So, for example, instead of writing skate, you know, like skateboard, they would write S-K and then the number eight, so skate.

215
But we call it text speak because it's very short and kind of abbreviated.
但我们称之为文本语言，因为它非常简短且有点缩写。

217
So even you will find, I saw a report the other day, essays or reports handed in with these terrible spelling mistakes.
所以你会发现，我前几天看到一份报告，提交的论文或报告中有这些可怕的拼写错误。

218
That's awful.

219
Well, I hope, hope, hope that people are learning grammar and spelling, especially non-native learners of English.
