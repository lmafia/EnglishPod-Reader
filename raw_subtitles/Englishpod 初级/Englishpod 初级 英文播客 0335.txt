Hey, honey.

I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air.

It wasn't too crowded, but we had a great time.
不算太拥挤，但我们玩得很开心。

15
We got on the seesaw together, then went on a couple of different slides, and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym, but I didn't fit.
我们一起玩了跷跷板，然后玩了几个滑梯，接着我想和他一起去攀爬架，但我进不去。

16
Sounds like fun.
听起来很有趣。

17
When we go, he always just likes to play in the sandbox.
每次去，他总是喜欢在沙箱里玩。

18
Yeah, but today he was really hyper.
是的，但今天他特别兴奋。

19
He even got under the monkey bars.
他甚至钻到了单杠下面。

20
And then he went on to go on the swings for half an hour.
然后他在秋千上玩了半个小时。

21
I'm exhausted.
我累坏了。

22
You should go to the park more often, since you don't go to the gym anymore.
你应该多去公园，因为你不再去健身房了。

23
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at some of this great playground equipment on Language Takeaway.
好吧，我们回来了，现在让我们看看Language Takeaway中的一些很棒的游乐设施。

24
So, as you said, Marco, today we're focusing in Language Takeaway on some of these things you can do at the park.
正如你所说，Marco，今天我们在Language Takeaway中关注公园里的一些活动。

25
Now, the first one is one of my personal favorites from childhood, called the seesaw.
第一个是我童年时最喜欢的玩具之一，叫做跷跷板。

26
The seesaw, that's right.
跷跷板，没错。

27
And so, basically, it's that long piece of, well, sometimes metal or wood, and two people sit at each opposite end.
基本上，它是一根长长的金属或木头，两个人坐在两端。

28
Yes, and so when one person goes down, the other person goes up.
是的，当一个人下去时，另一个人就会上去。

29
And when that person goes down, the other person goes up.
当那个人下去时，另一个人就会上去。

30
So it's a seesaw.
所以这是跷跷板。

31
That's right.
没错。

32
So, yes, it's actually a very common toy that you can play with at the playground.
是的，它实际上是一个非常常见的游乐设施。

33
But also, another very common one I'm sure everyone knows and has been on is a slide.
还有另一个大家都知道的常见玩具是滑梯。

34
A slide.
滑梯。

35
Now, this is a bit hard to describe, actually.
这个其实有点难描述。

36
Slides are usually quite colorful.
滑梯通常很色彩斑斓。

37
But they're like tubes that are open, and the child can go down.
它们像是开放的管道，孩子可以从上面滑下来。

38
So you're on top, maybe two meters high, and then you go down the slide and you come down to the ground.
所以你在上面，可能两米高，然后滑下去，落到地面。

39
That's right.
没错。

40
And actually, it's the noun, a slide.
实际上，它是名词，滑梯。

41
But what you do, the verb, is you actually slide down the slide.
但你做的动作，动词，是滑下滑梯。

42
Yes, and sometimes you go very fast and it's scary.
是的，有时你滑得很快，感觉很刺激。

43
That's right.
没错。

44
And, well, if you want to have something a little bit less scary, you can go into the jungle gym.
如果你想要一些不那么刺激的，可以去攀爬架。

45
Alright, jungle.
好吧，丛林。

46
Now, the jungle is actually a place, you know.
其实丛林是一个地方，你知道的。

47
In South America, for example, you have jungles with lots of trees and monkeys and everything.
比如在南美洲，有很多树和猴子的丛林。

48
But a jungle gym is like many, many different metal bars or wood together to make this open structure that boys and girls can climb on.
但攀爬架就像是许多金属或木头条组成的开放结构，男孩和女孩可以在上面攀爬。

49
So basically, you start on the ground and you climb all the way up it.
所以基本上，你从地面开始，一直爬上去。

50
Okay, so I think this is why it's called kind of like a jungle gym, right?
好吧，我想这就是为什么它叫做丛林攀爬架，对吧？

51
Because you can climb up and down and grab all these bars.
因为你可以上下攀爬，抓住这些条。

52
You can hang like a monkey from the bars.
你可以像猴子一样从条上悬挂。

53
Exactly.
正是如此。

54
Yeah, so basically it's just a cage that boys and girls can climb on and play with.
是的，基本上它就是一个男孩和女孩可以攀爬和玩耍的笼子。

55
Right, and I guess you call it a jungle gym because when you're doing all this, you're doing exercise.
对， 我想你叫它丛林攀爬架是因为在做这些时，你在锻炼。

56
That's right.
没错。

57
Alright, so now maybe for the smaller kids who just want to play with some toys, they can just hang out at the sandbox.
好吧，现在对于那些只想玩玩具的小孩，他们可以在沙箱里玩。

58
Alright, this is one word, but it's actually quite literal.
好吧，这只是一个词，但它实际上是非常字面的。

59
You'd have sand in a box.
你会在一个箱子里有沙子。

60
That's right.
没错。

61
And a sandbox is very safe and very fun because boys and girls can make castles or dig.
沙箱非常安全且有趣，因为男孩和女孩可以建造城堡或挖掘。

62
But there's nothing to it, really.
但其实没什么特别的。

63
It's just a box with sand.
这只是一个装沙子的箱子。

64
It's just a box with sand, literally.
这只是一个装沙子的箱子，字面上说。

65
Yes, that's right.
是的，没错。

66
So that's also fun for the smaller kids to be at the sandbox.
所以对小孩来说，在沙箱里玩也很有趣。

67
Now, going back to something very similar to the jungle gym, we have the monkey bars.
现在，回到与攀爬架非常相似的东西，我们有单杠。

68
Okay, now monkey bars are a very important part of the park.
好吧，单杠是公园中非常重要的一部分。

69
These are horizontal bars, so they're across.
这些是水平的杆，所以是横着的。

70
And you hang on them with your arms, so your body hangs down, and when you hang, your feet are off the ground.
你用手臂悬挂在上面，身体悬空，脚离地。

71
It's very tall.
它非常高。

72
Right.
对。

73
And you have to move.
你必须移动。

74
You have to change from one bar to the other.
你必须从一根杆换到另一根。

75
So it's like a ladder that you're pulling yourself across.
所以就像是一个梯子，你在上面爬行。

76
Yes, exactly.
是的，正是如此。

77
So you've probably seen it exactly how you describe it.
所以你可能确实看到了你所描述的样子。

78
It's a ladder, and you've just got to hang on to the different bars with your arms.
这是一个梯子，你只需用手臂抓住不同的杆。

79
It's actually quite difficult to do.
这实际上是相当困难的。

80
I always used to get upset because I couldn't go all the way across.
我总是因为无法完全跨越而感到沮丧。

81
Because, you know, you go from one end to the other end.
因为，你知道的，你是从一端到另一端。

82
Right.
对。

83
But my arms would get so tired that I had to drop down onto the ground.
但我的手臂会累得不得不掉到地上。

84
Really.
真的。

85
All right, well, something that's a little bit less exhausting, but also very fun, are when you go on the swings.
好吧，稍微轻松一点，但也很有趣的是秋千。

86
All right, swings are great.
好吧，秋千很棒。

87
Now, swings are kind of like chairs, but they don't have a back.
现在，秋千有点像椅子，但没有靠背。

88
So you sit down on a piece that's maybe plastic, and someone behind you will push you.
所以你坐在一个可能是塑料的座位上，后面有人推你。

89
Right.
对。

90
Because you're on these hanging chairs, and they'll push you, and you go forward and backward.
因为你在这些悬挂的椅子上，他们会推你，你会前后摆动。

91
And you can go very, very high, and then you come back down.
你可以摆得非常高，然后再下来。

92
Exactly.
正是如此。

93
So these are swings.
所以这些就是秋千。

94
All of this equipment you've most likely seen at any of the parks that are nearby.
你很可能在附近的任何公园都见过这些设备。

95
But we're going to post some pictures as well so you can see more clearly what they're all about.
但我们也会发布一些图片，以便你更清楚地了解它们。

96
Now let's go and review the dialogue again before we move on to Fluency Builder.

112
So our first phrase today is actually something that the parent is talking about.
今天的第一个短语实际上是父母在谈论的内容。

113

她想带肯尼去公园透透气。

114
Now, what does it mean to go get fresh air?
那么，去透透气是什么意思呢？

115
Well, basically it means to go out and maybe walk or just be outside and get air from the outside, because sometimes you're in your house all the time and that's not fresh air.
基本上就是出去走走，或者只是待在外面，呼吸新鲜空气，因为有时你总是在家里，那不是新鲜空气。

That's right.
没错。

117
So basically this means exactly what you're saying.
所以基本上这正是你所说的。

118
It means going outside.
这意味着去外面。

119
So kids often need to go get some fresh air, but also adults do too.

120
Sometimes I feel like when I'm working in the office for a long time, I really need to get some fresh air.

121
So that means I go outside for a walk.

123
And you can tell your friends, oh, excuse me for a minute, I'm going to go get some fresh air.
