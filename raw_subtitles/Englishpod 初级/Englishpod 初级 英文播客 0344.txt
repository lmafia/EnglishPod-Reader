The first one comes from the beginning of the dialogue.

26
So what does that mean?
那这是什么意思？

27
That means, do you have free rooms?
这意味着，你们有空房吗？

28
Do you have any rooms I could rent?
你们有我可以租的房间吗？

29
So instead of saying, do you have any free rooms or do you have rooms available, you can just say, do you have availability?
所以与其说“你们有空房吗”或“你们有房间可用吗”，不如直接说“你们有可用性吗”？

30
That's right.
没错。

31
So you're basically asking the person, do you have anything available?
所以你基本上是在问对方，你们有任何可用的房间吗？

32
So what's your availability?
那么你们的可用性如何？

33
Very good.
非常好。

34
Okay.
好的。

35
Alright, so we asked the hotel if they have availability and obviously the receptionist needs to know when we expect to check in.
好的，所以我们问酒店是否有可用性，显然接待员需要知道我们预计的入住时间。

36
So this is a noun and a verb, but in today's dialogue, it's used as a verb.
这是一个名词和动词，但在今天的对话中，它用作动词。

37
So it's something we do to check in.
所以这是我们办理入住的动作。

So the person on the phone would like to know what date you expect to check in.

39
That means, when will you arrive at our hotel?

42
So we really specifically want to know when are you going to start sleeping here?

43
That's right.
没错。

44
And the opposite, so when you leave the hotel is called check out, to check out.
反之，当您离开酒店时称为退房。

45
That's right.
没错。

46
Okay, so we want to check in on July 9th and the receptionist tells us that we have available a single suite or a double suite.
好的，所以我们想在7月9日入住，接待员告诉我们有一个单人套房或一个双人套房可用。

47
Alright, so these are two different kinds of rooms.
好的，这两种房间是不同的。

48
Now a suite is different from a room because it actually means that the space you're going to use is more than one room.
套房与房间不同，因为它实际上意味着您将使用的空间超过一个房间。

49
Maybe two rooms or three.
可能是两个房间或三个房间。

50

52
It might have a sitting area or a kitchen area.
可能有一个休息区或厨房区域。

53
So that's what a suite is.

58
That means that we have one of these big rooms that is only for one person.
这意味着我们有一个仅供一个人使用的大房间。

59
And a double suite means that two or more people can sleep there.
而双人套房意味着可以容纳两人或更多人。

60
That's right.
没错。

61
So single would be one person and double would be two people.
所以单人是一个人，双人是两个人。

62
And we also heard similar words with the beds because sometimes the rooms aren't really clear about what kind of beds they have.
我们还听到了与床相关的类似词，因为有时房间的床型并不明确。

63
So this person asked, what's the difference between these rooms?
所以这个人问，这些房间有什么区别？

64
And the hotel employee answered, well the junior suite has one twin bed.
酒店员工回答说，初级套房有一张单人床。

65
Alright, what's a twin bed?

66
So a twin bed is basically a bed that's only for one person.
所以单人床基本上是只供一个人使用的床。

67
Only one person fits in there.
只有一个人可以躺在上面。

68
Alright, so it's a single bed basically.
好的，所以它基本上是单人床。

69
We call it a twin.
我们称之为单人床。

70
It's a standard size.

71
So everywhere you go, a twin is always for one person.
所以无论你去哪里，单人床总是供一个人使用。

72
That's right.
没错。

73
Alright, and if you want to have another person in bed, we have to get a bigger one.
好的，如果你想和另一个人一起睡，我们必须找一个更大的床。

74
And what's that bigger bed called?

It's called a double bed.

A double bed.

79
So this means that two people can sleep on the one bed.
这意味着两个人可以在一张床上睡觉。

80
That's right.
没错。

81
So this is important because sometimes you want to book a hotel room and it will be a double suite, but it will have two twin beds.
这很重要，因为有时你想预订一个酒店房间，它可能是双人套房，但会有两张单人床。

82
Alright, so it's a double room.

83
So it's for two people, but each person has their own small bed.

它是一个小冰箱或一个小区域，里面有小吃和饮料，你可以随意取用，但显然你需要在之后付款。

93
That's right.
没错。

94
So you can take them when you're staying there, but when you check out, when you leave, you have to pay for everything you ate or drank.
所以你可以在入住期间取用，但在退房时，你必须为你吃或喝的所有东西付款。

95
That's right.
