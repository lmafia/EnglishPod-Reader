24
Well, I'm used to that, Mr. Parsons, so that's not really a shot for me.

25
Good, as long as you understand that.

26
And when do you need to fill the vacancy, Mr. Parsons?

That sounds like deal.
听起来不错。

30
Alright, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

31
So, it's obviously a very difficult job, and she asked some very key questions, so why don't we take a look at a couple of the words and phrases used there on language takeaway.
显然，这是一个非常困难的工作，她问了一些非常关键的问题，所以我们来看看在语言学习中使用的一些词汇和短语。

32
Language takeaway.
语言学习。

33
The first word that we have here for language takeaway is workforce.
我们在这里的第一个词是“劳动力”。

34
That's right, a workforce.
没错，劳动力。

35
The company's workforce.
公司的劳动力。

36
And that basically means all the employees that we have working for us.
这基本上意味着我们所有为我们工作的人。

37
That might not be in one office.
这可能不在一个办公室里。

38
Many companies have two, three, even a hundred offices, so the workforce means all the people who work for the company combined.
许多公司有两个、三个，甚至一百个办公室，所以劳动力意味着为公司工作的所有人。

39
That's right, so a workforce.
没错，所以是劳动力。

40
And, well, she asked about the workforce, and, well, it's obviously a pretty big company, 150 employees.
她询问了劳动力，显然这是一个相当大的公司，有150名员工。

41
But he also mentioned that the news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 people, or 80 staff.
但他还提到香港的新闻编辑部大约有80人。

42
So, this verb, to comprise, or in this case, it comprises, means to make up or to account for.
所以，这个动词“包含”，在这种情况下是“包含”，意味着构成或占据。

43
It's a very nice word to say it accounts for, it makes up, it's the total.
这是一个很好的词，表示它占据了，总体上。

44
It's the total, right.
是总体，对。

45
So, in this case, the news desk staff has 80 people.

46
That's a very easy way to say it.

47
But we could say it comprises 80 people.

48
It sounds a bit better.

So, now, obviously, she's going to be a reporter or a journalist.
所以，显然，她将成为一名记者或新闻工作者。

51
And he said that she should be on call at any time.
他表示她应该随时待命。

52
Okay, on call is a phrase that we often hear with jobs like journalism, but also medicine.
好的，“待命”是我们在新闻行业和医学等工作中经常听到的短语。

53
So doctors have to be on call very often.
所以医生们经常需要待命。

54
This means that you don't have to be in the office, but you have to be available to come into the office.
这意味着你不必在办公室，但你必须随时可以进入办公室。

55
So, when someone calls you and they say, we have an emergency, you have to be available.

56
That's right.
没错。

57
And you see it in movies all the time.
你在电影中经常看到这种情况。

58
You know, doctors are on call and maybe they're already sleeping or maybe they're out, I don't know, playing soccer with their kids and they receive a phone call and they have to go to the hospital in that moment.
你知道，医生们待命，可能他们已经在睡觉，或者可能他们在外面，我不知道，和孩子们踢足球，然后接到电话，必须立刻去医院。

60
That's because they're on call.
这就是因为他们在待命。

61
Very good.
非常好。

62
And so, obviously, this is a very difficult thing for someone.
所以，显然，这对某人来说是非常困难的事情。

63
And he explains that the work has very unsociable hours at times.
他解释说，工作有时会在非常不合时宜的时间。

64
Okay, so you can say that the hours are unsociable.
好的，所以你可以说工作时间是不合时宜的。

65
You can also say that a person is unsociable.
你也可以说一个人是不合时宜的。

66
It basically means that it's not very convenient for being a social person or for going out with friends and having many events to go to or fun things to do in your personal life.
这基本上意味着不太方便社交或与朋友外出，参加许多活动或在个人生活中做有趣的事情。

67
That's right.
没错。

68
So, if a person is unsociable, it means that maybe that person is not very outgoing or maybe he's always angry or grumpy.
所以，如果一个人是不合时宜的，意味着那个人可能不太外向，或者可能他总是生气或不高兴。

69
So, that person doesn't get along well with others.
所以，那个人与他人相处得不好。

70
Right, but in this case, it doesn't mean that it's a grumpy job.
对，但在这种情况下，并不意味着这是一个令人不快的工作。

71
It just means that because she might have to work at night very often or on the weekends, it's very hard to have a social life.
这只是意味着她可能经常需要在晚上或周末工作，很难有社交生活。

72
That's right.
没错。

73
Okay, so obviously this job is very difficult, but in the end, she was really happy with it and she said that sounds ideal, her starting time.
好的，所以显然这份工作非常困难，但最后，她对此感到非常满意，并表示这听起来理想，她的开始时间。

74
So, something that's ideal if it's perfect or great or the top.
所以，理想的东西如果是完美的、伟大的或顶尖的。

That's right.
没错。

76
Many people talk about the ideal job, right?

78
So, that's the job that you have in your mind when you think of what is the best.

80
So, maybe my ideal job is different from your ideal job.

81

So, why don't we listen to the dialogue again?

88
Let's review what Rebecca and Mr. Parsons talked about and we'll be back in a little bit with Fluency Builder.
让我们回顾一下Rebecca和Parsons先生谈论的内容，稍后我们将带来流利度提升。

89
Could you tell me a little about the organization?
你能告诉我一些关于这个组织的情况吗？

90
For example, how big is your office here?
比如，你们的办公室有多大？

91
Well, in total, we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing.
嗯，总的来说，我们在香港大约有150名员工，在北京的总部还有400名。

93
I see.

And how about the working hours?

95
Well, as you know, Rebecca, in journalism, work hours are not exactly 9 to 5.
嗯，正如你所知，Rebecca，在新闻行业，工作时间并不完全是9到5。

96
You could be on call at any time, but we do have to work very unsociable hours at times.
你可能随时需要待命，但有时我们确实需要在非常不合时宜的时间工作。

97
Well, I'm used to that, Mr. Parsons, so that's not really a good start for me.
嗯，我对此已经习惯了，Parsons先生，所以这对我来说并不是个好开始。

102
That sounds ideal.
听起来很理想。

103
All right, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

104
So now we have four phrases for you prepared on Fluency Builder.
现在我们为你准备了四个短语在流利度构建器上。

105
Fluency Builder.
流利度构建器。

106
This first phrase is something that we say all the time in English, but I think a lot of learners make mistakes when they use it.
第一个短语是我们在英语中经常说的，但我认为很多学习者在使用时会犯错误。

107
The phrase is how about.
这个短语是“怎么样”。

108
That's right.
没错。

109
So you see that Rebecca was listening to what Mr. Parsons said, and she said, and how about the working hours?
所以你看到丽贝卡在听帕森斯先生说的话，她说，“那工作时间怎么样？”

110
So this is a way to say, and what are the working hours?
这是一种说法，问“工作时间是什么？”

111
But basically, it's a way to continue the conversation.
但基本上，这是继续对话的一种方式。

112
You can say this in many different ways, but it basically means, and what about, and or please tell me about.
你可以用很多不同的方式说这个，但基本上意味着“那怎么样”或“请告诉我”。

113
That's right.
没错。

114
Now remember that many English learners mistake the phrase how about, as if it were saying how are you or how is it?
现在记住，许多英语学习者会把“怎么样”这个短语误解为“你好吗”或“怎么样？”

115
No, you have to be following someone else in the conversation.
不，你必须跟随对话中的其他人。

116
So for example, I could say, you know what?
例如，我可以说，你知道吗？

117
I'm going to have a hamburger with bacon.
我打算吃一个培根汉堡。

118
How about you, Marco?
你呢，马尔科？

119
What are you going to eat?
你打算吃什么？

120
How about you buy me a cheeseburger?
你能给我买个奶酪汉堡吗？

121
Okay, so this is basically a way of saying, okay, well, maybe I'll have a cheeseburger or what are you going to have?
好吧，这基本上是说，好吧，也许我会吃个奶酪汉堡，或者你打算吃什么？

122
So now it's important to say don't ever make this question.
所以现在重要的是说，永远不要这样提问。

123
Don't ever ask, how about your weekend?
永远不要问，“你周末怎么样？”

124
No, no, no, no, no.
不，不，不，不，不。

125
How was your weekend?
你周末过得怎么样？

126
That's right.
没错。

127
My weekend was great.
我的周末很好。

128
How about yours?
你呢？

129
How about yours?
你呢？

130
That's continuing the conversation saying mine was good.
这是在继续对话，说“我很好，你呢？”

131
How was yours?
你过得怎么样？

132
Yeah.
是的。

133
Okay, so remember that when they were talking about the work hours, he said that the work hours are not exactly nine to five.
好的，所以记住，当他们在谈论工作时间时，他说工作时间并不完全是九到五。

134
Okay, so this is a kind of a set phrase we use often in English because a lot of people traditionally have worked from nine A.M.
好的，这是一种我们在英语中经常使用的固定短语，因为很多人传统上是从早上九点工作到下午五点。

135
to five P.M.
他们在午餐时休息，然后回家。

136
They have a break at lunch, then they go home.
没错。

137
That's right.
所以这是一种描述传统工作时间或传统工作的方式。

138
So this is a kind of measure for this is a way to describe traditional working hours or traditional jobs.
所以你可以说，是的，我有一份非常好的九到五的工作。

139
So you can say, yeah, I have a really nice nine to five job.
你可以说，我真的不想做九到五的工作。

140
You could say, I really don't want to work a nine to five job.
没错。

141
That's right.
所以你不想要一份传统的工作，从九点工作到五点。

142
So you don't want a traditional job where you're working from nine to five.
对。

143
Right.
我认为大多数人工作时间比这稍长，但这只是说传统工作的方式。

144
Most people, I think, work a little bit longer than that, but this is this is just a way of saying a traditional job.

145
That's right.
没错。

146
Okay, nine to five job.
好的，九到五的工作。

147
Now why don't we move on to Rebecca saying that she is used to working long hours or being on call.
现在我们为什么不继续谈丽贝卡说她习惯于长时间工作或待命。

148
Right, so this construction, to be used to, I'm used to doing this, is a way to say that I already do this.
对，所以这个结构，“习惯于”，我习惯于这样做，是说我已经这样做了。

149
This is my experience or I have the habit of working unusual hours.
这是我的经验，或者我有在不寻常的时间工作的习惯。

150
That's right.
没错。

151
So maybe, for example, you live in a very noisy area in your neighborhood and somebody comes and visits you and they can't sleep because it's so noisy.
例如，假设你住在一个非常吵闹的地方，某人来拜访你，他们因为太吵而无法入睡。

152
You're used to it.
你习惯了。

153
Oh, you say, oh, I don't mind.
哦，你会说，哦，我不介意。

154
I'm used to the noise.
我习惯了噪音。

155
But your friend who's visiting is not used to it.
但你来访的朋友并不习惯。

156
Right.
对。

157
They don't have this noise at home.
他们在家里没有这种噪音。

158
So that's what happens and they can't sleep.
所以这就是发生的事情，他们无法入睡。

159
So when you are used to something, you have the habit or you're accustomed to it.
所以当你习惯于某事时，你有这个习惯或你习惯于它。

160
That's right.
没错。

161
Okay, and what about our last phrase?
好的，我们最后一个短语呢？

162
Our last phrase comes at the end and Rebecca is talking about the start date for this job.
我们最后一个短语出现在最后，丽贝卡在谈论这份工作的开始日期。

163
She wants to know, when do you need to fill the vacancy?
她想知道，您需要什么时候填补这个空缺？

164
Okay, to fill the vacancy.
好的，填补空缺。

165
Now we have this word vacancy and that means that it's available, right?
现在我们有这个词“空缺”，意思是它是可用的，对吗？

166
That's right.
没错。

167
So vacancy is an available thing.
所以“空缺”是一个可用的东西。

168
It could be a vacant place, like an apartment, like an apartment, or in this case, a vacancy in a company.
它可以是一个空置的地方，比如一个公寓，或者在这种情况下，是公司中的一个空缺。

169
That means a job that is available.
这意味着一个可用的工作。

170
That's right.
没错。

171
So she is asking when she can fill the vacancy.
所以她在问她什么时候可以填补这个空缺。

172
So we use the verb fill, to fill a vacancy.
所以我们使用动词“填补”，填补空缺。

173
And this sounds a lot better than saying, hey, when do I start working here?
这听起来比说，“嘿，我什么时候开始在这里工作？”要好得多。

174
Right.
对。

175
This is a polite way to say, you know, when is the job going to begin?
这是一种礼貌的说法，问你知道，工作什么时候开始？

176
When do you need to fill the vacancy by?
你需要在什么时候填补这个空缺？

177
I guess another way of saying it would be, when is the starting date?
我想另一种说法是，开始日期是什么时候？

178
Yes.
是的。

179
Okay, but as we say, also fill the vacancy is a very good option.
好的，但正如我们所说，填补空缺也是一个很好的选择。

180
But don't say, when do I start working?
但不要说，“我什么时候开始工作？”

181
Or when do we start?
或者“我们什么时候开始？”

182
Yeah, no, we can talk about that in a minute.
是的，不，我们可以稍后再谈这个。

183
Let's listen first to our dialogue one more time.
让我们先再听一遍我们的对话。

184
We'll be back shortly.
我们很快就回来。

185
Could you tell me a little about the organization?
你能告诉我一点关于这个组织的事吗？

186
For example, how big is your office here?
例如，你们这里的办公室有多大？

187
Well, in total, we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong, with another 400 in our head office in Beijing.

188
The news desk staff in Hong Kong has around 80 staff.

189

190
And how about the working hours?
那工作时间怎么样？

191
Well, as you know, Rebecca, in journalism, work hours are not exactly nine to five.
嗯，正如你所知，丽贝卡，在新闻行业，工作时间并不完全是九到五。

192
You could be on call at any time, but we do have to work very unsociable hours at times.
你随时可能需要待命，但有时我们确实需要在非常不合时宜的时间工作。

193
Well, I'm used to that, Mr. Parsons, so that's not really a shock for me.
嗯，我已经习惯了，帕森斯先生，所以这对我来说并不是一个震惊。

194
Good, as long as you understand that.
好的，只要你明白这一点。

195
And when do you need to fill the vacancy, Mr. Parsons?

197
We are hoping to start from the beginning of next month.
我们希望从下个月初开始。

198
That sounds ideal.
听起来很理想。

199
So talking about working hours, being on call, or unsociable working hours, have you ever had a job where you've had to work maybe through the night?
说到工作时间，待命或不合时宜的工作时间，你有没有过需要通宵工作的工作？

200
Yes, I used to work in a movie theater when I was in college.
有，我在大学时曾在电影院工作。

201
I had a day job too, so it was kind of a mess.

205
And so I could never go out with my friends.
所以我从来不能和朋友出去。

206
Right, so while everyone was partying, you were at the movie theater.

207
Exactly.
正是如此。

208
Or they would come to the movies and I would sneak in and bring them popcorn.
或者他们会来电影院，我会偷偷带他们爆米花。

209
So these unusual working hours, it's very interesting because usually, although it is a little bit more of a sacrifice, they usually pay a little bit better, right?
所以这些不寻常的工作时间很有趣，因为通常虽然这有点牺牲，但通常薪水会稍微好一点，对吧？

210
They do, and there are some advantages.
是的，确实如此，还有一些好处。

211
It means that you get to sleep in really late.

212
You know, you don't have to wake up early.

213
And you have the day off, like the entire day to do something.

223
to about 6 A.M.

226
I've seen so many sunrises and it's not really romantic for me anymore.
我已经看过很多次日出，对我来说已经不再浪漫了。

227
We would call you a night owl, someone who's more awake at night.
我们会称你为夜猫子，晚上更清醒的人。

228
That's right, and I still am.
