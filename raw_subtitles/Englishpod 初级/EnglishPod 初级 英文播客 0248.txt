Silverware are all the tools that we use to eat food with.

39
And in this, so for example, a fork is some part of a silverware.

That's right, and sometimes there are foods that are very, very hard to cut.
没错，有时有些食物非常难切。

50
For example, steak is very hard to cut because it's a tough meat.
例如，牛排很难切，因为它是硬肉。

51
And so in that case, we use a steak knife to cut it.

53
Steak knife, more specifically, is used to cut meats.

54
Alright, so these are three kinds or actually four kinds of silverware.
好吧，这些是三种或实际上四种餐具。

55
Of course, there are other kinds, but those are the most important.
当然，还有其他种类，但这些是最重要的。

56
After that though, we have something that's important for making your food taste better.

Those are called salt and pepper shakers.
那些叫盐和胡椒瓶。

60
We saw them in the dialogue that we need to put out the pepper and salt shakers.
我们在对话中看到我们需要把盐和胡椒瓶拿出来。

61
So the little thing where you keep the salt is called a shaker.
所以放盐的小东西叫做瓶。

62
That's right, because the action, the verb is to shake.
没错，因为这个动作，动词是摇。

63
That means moving your hand up and down so some salt will fall out onto your food.
这意味着上下移动你的手，让一些盐落到你的食物上。

64
Exactly, so usually it's only salt and pepper that we keep in these things and these little shakers.
正是如此，所以通常我们只在这些小瓶里放盐和胡椒。

65
But apart from salt and pepper shakers and all the silverware we're putting out, we're also putting out some saucers because we're gonna have coffee later on.
除了盐和胡椒瓶以及我们摆出的所有餐具外，我们还会摆出一些碟子，因为我们稍后要喝咖啡。

66
Okay, so this normally goes together with cups, cups and saucers, but everyone knows what a cup is.
好的，这通常和杯子一起使用，杯子和碟子，但每个人都知道杯子是什么。

碟子是你在喝咖啡时放在杯子下面的小盘子。

69
So usually that's where you keep your spoon or maybe the little bag of tea.
所以通常这是你放勺子或小茶包的地方。

70
Okay, so a saucer is important because it also helps in case you spill some coffee or tea so the coffee or tea doesn't go on the ground, it goes on the plate.
好的，碟子很重要，因为它也可以防止你洒咖啡或茶，这样咖啡或茶不会洒到地上，而是洒在盘子上。

71
Exactly, so that little plate is called a saucer.
没错，所以那个小盘子叫做碟子。

72
Now, where do we keep all the plates, all the silverware?
现在，我们把所有的盘子和餐具放在哪里？

73
We usually keep them in a cupboard.
我们通常把它们放在橱柜里。

74
Okay, so you might want to say cupboard because it's C-U-P-B-O-A-R-D.

85
It's like a, it's like a tall bowl with a spout, so you can pour it, that keeps gravy.

95
These are very, very easy to break.

96
Wine glasses are basically just glasses that maybe are tall and you drink wine out of them.

97
That's right.

98
So there's a specific type of glass usually used to drink wine.
所以酒杯是一种特定类型的杯子，通常用来喝酒。

99
So wine glasses, I guess a normal glass that you use to drink maybe juice or water is just called a glass.
所以酒杯，我想你用来喝果汁或水的普通杯子就叫做杯子。

100
Right, you wouldn't say wine glass.
对，你不会说酒杯。

101
Only when you're drinking wine.
只有在喝酒的时候。

Okay, so we've taken a look at a lot of vocab here, a lot of tools that we use at the dinner table when we're having dinner.
好的，我们已经看了很多词汇，很多在吃晚餐时用的工具。

103
So let's listen to the dialogue again and review.

117
Just be careful because the wine glasses are also the...

118
Oops!
哎呀！

119
Alright, we're back, so now we have four key phrases that we've prepared for you on Fluency Builder.
好的，我们回来了，现在我们为你准备了四个关键短语在流利表达中。

120
Okay, so this first phrase is very important, especially as a child your mother or father might ask you to do this.
好的，第一个短语非常重要，尤其是作为孩子时，你的母亲或父亲可能会让你这样做。

121
The phrase is to set the table.
这个短语是摆桌子。

122
Okay, so that's a phrasal verb, to set the table.
好的，这是一个短语动词，摆桌子。

123
And what does it mean if you're asked to set the table?
如果你被要求摆桌子，这意味着什么？

124
It means you will put down the plates and the silverware and the bowls so that everything is prepared for dinner.
这意味着你会放下盘子、餐具和碗，以便一切准备好吃晚餐。

125
Okay, so this is actually what we were doing and a complementary phrasal verb to this when you're setting the table, as you said, you are putting down or putting out the different spoons, knives, dishes all that stuff.
好的，这实际上就是我们在做的事情，而与此相关的一个补充短语是，当你摆桌子时，正如你所说的，你是在放下或拿出不同的勺子、刀子、碟子等等。

126
Right, so the verbal phrase to put out means to place down or to make sure that you get something out on the table.
对，所以动词短语“拿出”意味着放下或确保把某物拿到桌子上。

127
In this case, my mother would usually ask me to put out extra glasses for water, okay, or don't forget to put out the wine glasses in case we're drinking wine.
在这种情况下，我的母亲通常会让我拿出额外的水杯，好的，或者别忘了拿出酒杯，以防我们喝酒。

128
It just means to place down.
这只是意味着放下。

129
Exactly, so just remember that we use it because all these things that are inside the cupboard, so you have to take them out, so you have to put them out on the table.
正是如此，所以只要记住我们使用它，因为所有这些东西都在橱柜里，所以你必须把它们拿出来，放到桌子上。

130
Alright, and sometimes we may have a guest or we may need an extra chair or an extra seat because we're having company and the person in the dialogue said to set an extra placemat just in case.
好的，有时我们可能会有客人，或者我们可能需要额外的椅子或额外的座位，因为我们有客人，而对话中的人说要多摆一个餐垫以防万一。

131
Okay, so placemat is basically a piece of plastic or maybe fabric that you put in front of a person when they're at the table, so it's on the table and it's something that protects the table.
好的，餐垫基本上是放在一个人面前的塑料或布料，所以它在桌子上，是保护桌子的东西。

132
So it's small, everyone has one, and the bowl and the silverware will go on top of that placemat, but it also indicates that that is where someone will sit.
所以它很小，每个人都有一个，碗和餐具会放在那个餐垫上，但它也表示那是某人将要坐的地方。

133
Okay, so to put out or to set out an extra placemat means to prepare an extra place for someone else who will be coming.
好的，拿出或摆出一个额外的餐垫意味着为将要来的人准备一个额外的地方。

134
So if you have a guest, for example, you'll set out an extra placemat for him or for her.
所以如果你有一个客人，比如说，你会为他或她摆出一个额外的餐垫。

135
Okay, so we can say set an extra placemat because by this we are referring that somebody is going to sit down at the table or you can just simply say set an extra place for someone.
好的，所以我们可以说摆一个额外的餐垫，因为这样我们指的是某人将要坐在桌子上，或者你可以简单地说为某人摆一个额外的地方。

136
That's right, set an extra place your older brother is coming home from college tonight.
没错，摆一个额外的地方，你的哥哥今晚从大学回家。

137
Okay, so we can set an extra place for him at the table and well, in this case we didn't know if the brother was really coming or not, so she said just in case.
好的，我们可以在桌子上为他摆一个额外的地方，而在这种情况下，我们不知道哥哥是否真的会来，所以她说以防万一。

138
This is a great phrase, one that you'll hear all the time.
这是一个很好的短语，你会经常听到。

139
It means I'm not sure what the result will be or what the outcome will be, but in case something happens or just in case we should do this.
这意味着我不确定结果会是什么，但以防万一发生什么，或者以防万一我们应该这样做。

140
So for example, Marco, I think it's going to rain today, you should bring an umbrella just in case.
例如，马尔科，我觉得今天会下雨，你应该带把伞以防万一。

141
Okay, so this is a way of saying you're preventing something, you're prepared.
好的，这是一种说你在预防某事，你在准备。

142
Maybe if it does rain you'll have an umbrella.
也许如果真的下雨，你会有把伞。

例如，很多人把陶瓷盘子称为瓷器。

164
Yeah, these are usually the fancy kinds of plates and dishes that you have in your house.
是的，这通常是你家里那种精致的盘子和碟子。

165
Obviously, if you have just kind of the cheap ceramics that you can throw away or even paper plates, those aren't very important, but at a wedding or in a special occasion, a person or family might receive China ware.
显然，如果你只有那种便宜的陶瓷，甚至是纸盘，那就不太重要，但在婚礼或特殊场合，一个人或家庭可能会收到瓷器。

166
China.
瓷器。

167
And that is very nice, very pretty porcelain plates or just lacquerware.
那是非常好，非常漂亮的瓷盘或漆器。

168
Okay, so you can call it China ware, which is basically plates that are either very fine ceramic or porcelain, as you said.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, because it's always been kind of strange the fact that a name like China would also now be related to plates, but apparently I guess because Chinese porcelain is renowned as being such high quality I guess this is why now we just have a word for it called China or China ware.
是的，因为将一个名字像瓷器与盘子联系在一起一直有点奇怪，但显然我想是因为中国瓷器以其高质量而闻名，我想这就是为什么我们现在有一个词叫瓷器或瓷器。

176
I think it actually has to do with the fact that the Chinese in the old days sold, well, most of the British bought their porcelain from China.
我认为这实际上与过去中国人出售的事实有关，嗯，大多数英国人从中国购买他们的瓷器。
