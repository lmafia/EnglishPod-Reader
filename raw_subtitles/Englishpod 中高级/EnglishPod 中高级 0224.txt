60
They are obviously investigating a break-in.
他们显然在调查一起入室盗窃。

61
Okay, a break-in, yeah.
好吧，入室盗窃，是的。

62
So someone broke into this family's house, so they have to investigate the evidence and some of the things that were left behind.

63
So now, why don't we take a look on language takeaways, some of the specific words they used.

64
Alright, the first word that we have is forensics.
好吧，第一个词是法医。

65
The forensics team.
法医团队。

66
Forensics team.
法医团队。

67
So a forensics team is a team at a police department or a police station that studies the things that are left behind after a crime.
法医团队是警察局或警察站的一个团队，研究犯罪后留下的东西。

Alright, so that team goes and collects the evidence.

69

70
A forensics team is kind of like a team that puts together puzzle pieces, trying to figure out what the story was.
法医团队就像一个拼图团队，试图拼凑出故事。

71
So as you said, the TV show CSI, the whole show revolves around, follows a group of forensic scientists who go to crime scenes and look at blood and different pieces of evidence that are left behind.
正如你所说，电视剧《CSI》整个节目围绕着一组法医科学家，他们去犯罪现场查看血迹和不同的证据。

72

73
So one piece of evidence that a forensics team might look at is a fingerprint.

74
That's right, a fingerprint.
没错，指纹。

75
Or in the dialogue, we found fingerprints, the plural form.
或者在对话中，我们发现了指纹，复数形式。

76
Okay, so for example, if you go to a police station because the police think that you have committed a crime, the police will take your fingerprints.
好吧，例如，如果你去警察局，因为警察认为你犯了罪，警察会采集你的指纹。

77
That means they'll put your finger, that means they'll put your fingers into ink and they will make you push your fingers onto a piece of paper to see what your fingers look like.
这意味着他们会把你的手指放入墨水中，然后让你把手指按在纸上，以查看你的指纹。

78
That's right.
没错。

79
So our fingerprints have a unique pattern.
所以我们的指纹有独特的模式。

80
Everyone has different fingerprints.

81
There are no two fingerprints alike in the world, right?
世界上没有两个指纹是相同的，对吧？

Right, so it's kind of like a form of identification.
对，所以这算是一种身份识别。

83
Very good.
非常好。

84
That's right, so that is your fingerprint.
没错，这就是你的指纹。

85
So moving on, we talked about fingerprints and the scientists who are investigating the crime scene.
接下来，我们谈到了指纹和调查犯罪现场的科学家。

86
And they are talking about a very important piece of trace evidence.
他们在谈论一项非常重要的痕迹证据。

87
Okay, well let's look first at the second word there.
好吧，我们先看看第二个词。

88
We've got the word evidence.
我们有证据这个词。

89
So evidence is something that is usually physical, like a piece of clothing or hair, that can be used against someone when we're trying to prove that they have committed a crime.
所以证据是通常是物理的东西，比如一件衣服或头发，可以用来指控某人，证明他们犯了罪。

90
Right, so for example, a weapon or fingerprints, all that is evidence.
对，例如，武器或指纹，所有这些都是证据。

91
Okay, so Marco, what's the difference between evidence and trace evidence?
好吧，Marco，证据和痕迹证据有什么区别？

92
Well, as you notice, you have the specific word there, trace.
嗯，正如你所注意到的，你有一个特定的词，痕迹。

93
And to trace means to follow...
而追踪意味着跟随...

94
To connect, maybe.
连接，也许。

95
To connect, right?
连接，对吧？

96
So what you're doing here is you're taking this evidence to follow or connect the person that committed the crime.
所以你在这里做的是利用这些证据来跟踪或连接犯下罪行的人。

97
So for example, fingerprints lets you know who committed the crime.
例如，指纹让你知道谁犯了罪。

98
Oh, okay.
哦，好的。

99
Or maybe if you have blood, you can find out who did this crime.
或者如果你有血，你可以找出谁做了这个罪行。

100
Right.
对。

101
But what about like a broken window?
但是像破窗户这样的情况呢？

102
Well, that's just evidence.
嗯，那只是证据。

103
That just lets you know how the crime was committed, maybe how they got into the house.
这只是让你知道犯罪是如何发生的，也许是他们是如何进入房子的。

104
But not who did it.
但并不知道是谁做的。

105
But not who did it.
但并不知道是谁做的。

106
Okay, so trace evidence helps you connect the crime to the person who committed the crime.
好吧，所以痕迹证据帮助你将犯罪与实施犯罪的人联系起来。

107
And well, moving on, we found that very important piece of trace evidence, which was a piece of or a strand of golden hair.
而且，继续，我们发现了一个非常重要的痕迹证据，那是一缕金色的头发。

108
And the police officer said, well, this tells me that the suspect has long golden hair.
警察说，这告诉我嫌疑人有长长的金色头发。

109
So a suspect.
所以是一个嫌疑人。

110
Okay, this word is, it looks exactly the same as the word to suspect.
好吧，这个词看起来和“怀疑”这个词完全一样。

111
But be careful because we say these two words in different ways.
但要小心，因为我们用这两个词的方式不同。

112
So to suspect, that's a verb.
所以“怀疑”，这是一个动词。

113
That's right.
没错。

114
So I suspect Marco did it.
所以我怀疑马尔科做了这件事。

115
So that means I think or I imagine.
这意味着我认为或我想象。

116
Right.
对。

117
Whereas a suspect, a noun, a suspect.
而“嫌疑人”，一个名词，嫌疑人。

118

120
Okay.
好的。

121
Okay.
好的。

122
So for example, we're talking about some trace evidence like long blonde hair.
所以例如，我们在谈论一些痕迹证据，比如长长的金发。

123
That means the suspect is probably a woman and is probably blonde.
这意味着嫌疑人可能是一个女人，并且可能是金发。

124
Very good.
非常好。

125
And it's interesting that you use the verb to suspect and a suspect all because you're not sure yet.
有趣的是，你使用动词“怀疑”和名词“嫌疑人”，因为你还不确定。

126
So this person may have committed the crime or may not.
所以这个人可能实施了犯罪，也可能没有。

127
That's right.
没错。

128
So we have to wait until the trial.
所以我们必须等到审判。

129
We have to wait until we prove this person is guilty before we can say that they actually committed the crime.
我们必须等到证明这个人有罪之前，才能说他们实际上实施了犯罪。

131
Okay.
好的。

132
And well, you have a suspect and usually you also have somebody who is an accomplice to the crime or to the suspect.
而且，你有一个嫌疑人，通常你也有一个是犯罪的同谋或嫌疑人的人。

It's a noun.
这是一个名词。

So is an accomplice.
同谋也是。

137
So accomplice is a suspect's helper.

138
Right.
对。

139
So basically if you're robbing a bank and I wait outside in the car while you're robbing the bank, then I am an accomplice.
所以基本上如果你在抢银行，而我在外面等着开车，那我就是同谋。

140
That's right.
没错。

141
And under most laws, you could be sentenced to jail.
在大多数法律下，你可能会被判入狱。

142
Right.
对。

143
So the accomplice usually doesn't commit the crime.
所以同谋通常不实施犯罪。

You robbed the bank, but I just waited outside in the car to drive you out.
你抢了银行，但我只是等在外面的车里来接你。

146
Right.
对。

147

So an accomplice is basically just the helper of the criminal, but they can get in trouble too.
所以同谋基本上只是犯罪者的助手，但他们也可能惹上麻烦。

That's a really important aspect.
