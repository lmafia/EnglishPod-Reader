We learned a little bit about why it celebrated, how it came to be.
我们了解了一些关于它的庆祝原因和起源。

31
So let's take a look at some of those words now on language takeaway.
现在让我们看看一些单词，进行语言学习。

32
Language takeaway.
语言学习。

33
The first word we have for you guys today on language takeaway is settler.
今天我们要学习的第一个单词是定居者。

34
Now, a settler is a person.
定居者是一个人。

35
What kind of a person is a settler?
定居者是什么样的人？

36
Basically, it's a person that goes to a place to settle down there or to settle there.
基本上，定居者是去某个地方定居的人。

37
And that basically means to live there, to stay there permanently.
这基本上意味着在那里生活，永久居留。

38
All right.
好的。

39
But the idea with a settler is that he or she will start to build something, build a house, build a city, build a town.
但定居者的想法是他或她会开始建造一些东西，建造房屋、城市或城镇。

40
So settlers go to places where there aren't very many people.
所以定居者去人不多的地方。

41
That's right.
没错。

42
Kind of hard to be a settler now.
现在当定居者有点难。

43
But yeah, back then, obviously, there were so many places that were undiscovered or didn't have people and they would settle there.
但在那时，显然有很多地方是未被发现的，或者没有人，他们会在那里定居。

44
And the place where they went in the United States is called Massachusetts.
他们去的地方在美国叫马萨诸塞州。

45
Massachusetts.
马萨诸塞州。

46
Now, this is a very long, very hard to pronounce the word.
这是一个非常长且难以发音的词。

47
And I believe it comes from a local Indian language.
我相信它来自当地的印第安语言。

48
But Massachusetts, if you break it down, Massachusetts is a state.
但马萨诸塞州，如果你拆分开，马萨诸塞州是一个州。

49
And you might have heard of the biggest city in Massachusetts, which is Boston.
你可能听说过马萨诸塞州最大的城市，即波士顿。

50
So Boston, Massachusetts.
所以波士顿，马萨诸塞州。

51
But this is where the settlers first came when they came to America.
但这就是定居者首次来到美国的地方。

52
That's right.
没错。

53
So I think if you go to Boston, it has kind of this atmosphere of, you know, of the settlers and how this old little touch to it, of how it used to be, right?
所以我认为如果你去波士顿，它有一种定居者的氛围，带有旧时的感觉，对吧？

54
There is an old feel to Boston, because unlike most places in America, Boston has been a city for over 400 years, almost 500 years.
波士顿有一种古老的感觉，因为与美国大多数地方不同，波士顿已经是一个城市超过400年，几乎500年。

55
So it's much different from places like California or Texas.
所以它与加利福尼亚或德克萨斯州等地方大相径庭。

56
That's right.
没错。

57
OK, so the settlers arrived to Massachusetts and they went there because of religious persecution from England and King James.
好的，定居者到达马萨诸塞州是因为来自英格兰和詹姆斯国王的宗教迫害。

58
OK, so the key here is persecution.
好的，这里的关键是迫害。

59
This is something that you do to someone else, or this is something a government does to someone else.
这是你对其他人做的事情，或者这是政府对其他人做的事情。

60
Basically, to persecute someone is to limit them or to attack them or to prevent them from doing things that they want to do.
基本上，迫害某人就是限制他们、攻击他们或阻止他们做他们想做的事情。

61
That's right.
没错。

62
So basically, that is the reason why they left England, because the king was persecuting them.
所以这基本上是他们离开英格兰的原因，因为国王在迫害他们。

63
They didn't let them have their own religion.
他们不允许他们有自己的宗教。

64
Right.
对。

65
They had this religion and the king did not approve of the religion and they felt like people were critical of them or attacking them or preventing them from practicing this religion.
他们有这种宗教，而国王不赞成这种宗教，他们觉得人们对他们持批评态度，或者攻击他们，或者阻止他们实践这种宗教。

66
And so their religious persecution in England pushed them to this place, the New World.
所以他们在英格兰的宗教迫害促使他们来到这个地方，新世界。

67
So that's our next word, right?
所以这是我们的下一个单词，对吧？

68
That's right.
没错。

69
The New World.
新世界。

70
And this is what they used to call the continent of the United States or North America.
这是他们曾经称呼美国或北美大陆的名称。

71
They used to call it the New World.
他们曾称之为新世界。

72
All right.
好的。

73
So New World, Old World.
所以新世界，旧世界。

74
So if we think of Europe as being the Old World, America, like you're saying, Latin America, North America, these are part of the New World.
如果我们把欧洲视为旧世界，美洲，比如你说的，拉丁美洲、北美，这些都是新世界的一部分。

75
So it's almost like they had never been discovered before.
所以几乎就像它们从未被发现过。

76
Right.
对。

77
So, yeah, basically everyone was concentrated in Europe at that time.
所以，基本上那时每个人都集中在欧洲。

78
And then when they went to the West, they went to the New World.
然后当他们向西去时，他们去了新世界。

79
And obviously, when they arrived, it wasn't empty.
显然，当他们到达时，这里并不空荡荡。

80
They had people there.
他们那里有人民。

81
And we say that they are the natives of that land.
我们称他们为那片土地的土著。

82
OK, so a native of some place is someone who comes from there originally.
好的，某地的土著是指原本来自那里的人。

83
All right.
好的。

84
So if I came to America in 1500, there were Native American Indians who were living there.
如果我在1500年来到美国，那时有生活在那里的美洲印第安人。

85
And so they're the natives of this place.
所以他们是这个地方的土著。

86
Natives.
土著。

87
Now, can you use that nowadays?

88

I'm a native of Chicago.

91
Yes, you can.

92
It's a little bit, you know, it's a little bit less common than saying I'm from Chicago or I'm from Italy, but it's also correct.
这有点不常见，通常会说我来自芝加哥或我来自意大利，但也是正确的。

93
OK, but in this case, we're talking about the natives as the people who were already there.
好的，但在这种情况下，我们谈论的是已经在那里的土著人。

94
Yes, Native American Indians.
是的，美洲印第安人。

95
Like Squanto.

98
And this native named Squanto taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn.
这位名叫Squanto的土著教他们如何从当地收获食物，比如玉米。

99
So this is the interesting part of the story.
所以这是故事中有趣的部分。

100
It is basically these two groups worked together.
基本上这两个群体合作。

101
You have Native American Indians and settlers, and they worked together to make a meal and to survive, basically.
你有印第安人和定居者，他们一起合作做饭和生存。

102
And to harvest food, to harvest, the key here is that it's a verb.
收获食物，关键是这是一个动词。

103
It's something you do to crops or like corn or potatoes.
这是你对作物，比如玉米或土豆所做的事情。

104
And you take them out from the field and you bring them home.
你把它们从田里拿出来，带回家。

105
Right.
对。

106
So in this case, the corn is growing out of the land.
所以在这种情况下，玉米是从土地上长出来的。

107
And if you go out and cut it down and take it, you are harvesting corn.
如果你出去割掉它并拿走，你就是在收获玉米。

108
You are collecting it.
你在收集它。

109
Exactly.
正是如此。

110
And so they harvested the food and they have a very big meal.
他们收获了食物，享用了丰盛的晚餐。

111
So we do want to talk about the special meal here that features all of this harvested food.
我们确实想谈谈这里的特别餐点，包含所有这些收获的食物。

112
Let's take a look at some of those words in language takeaway part two.
让我们看看语言学习第二部分中的一些词汇。

113
All right.
好的。

114
So talking about the foods now, obviously, the tradition is that you have this big meal together.
现在谈到食物，显然，传统是大家一起享用丰盛的晚餐。

115
And the one thing that is, I think, a given is that you have a big Turkey.
我认为有一点是显而易见的，那就是你有一只大火鸡。

116
That's right.
没错。

117
So a Turkey is a bird.
火鸡是一种鸟。

118
They make very funny sounds, don't they?
它们发出很有趣的声音，不是吗？

Yeah, this is a weird thing.

I usually don't see Turkey too much if not during Thanksgiving.

127
Like I don't see somebody like a restaurant offering Turkey.
我不见得会看到餐厅提供火鸡。

128
No, you don't.

But you do see it in delis like a roast Turkey sandwich.

Gravy is made from, well, you can make different kinds of gravy.

But the way that we make it at my house is we take all of the juice from the Turkey, because when you bake a Turkey in the oven, some on the bottom of the pan, you'll get some liquid, some water, some fat, and you use that to make a gravy.
但我们家制作肉汁的方式是我们把火鸡的所有汁液拿来，因为当你在烤箱里烤火鸡时，锅底会有一些液体、水和脂肪，你用这些来制作肉汁。

221
And so this is actually a nice holiday because everybody is home.
所以这实际上是一个很好的节日，因为每个人都在家。

222
Right.
对。

223
So it's it doesn't have a religious connotation because you're talking about, you know, the settlers and how they arrived there and they survived a harsh winter.
所以它没有宗教含义，因为你在谈论定居者和他们如何到达那里并度过严酷的冬天。

224
And so as you say, it's kind of like a neutral holiday where you just it's a good excuse to get together, have a big meal and just spend quality time with the family.
所以正如你所说，这有点像一个中立的节日，你可以借此机会聚在一起，享用丰盛的餐点，和家人共度美好时光。

226
You cook all day, you eat, you watch some football on TV, you spend some time with your family and you fall asleep very, very full.
你整天做饭，吃饭，看电视上的橄榄球比赛，和家人共度时光，然后非常饱地入睡。

So this is another very interesting thing is that usually on TV, because everyone is home, everyone is having dinner or spending time with each other, they will have a football game on TV for Thanksgiving.
所以另一个非常有趣的事情是，通常在电视上，因为每个人都在家，大家都在吃晚餐或相聚，他们会在感恩节播放一场橄榄球比赛。

So everyone's sitting around eating dinner and then there's a football game on the TV.
所以每个人都围坐在一起吃晚餐，电视上正在播放橄榄球比赛。

230
Wow.
哇。

231
So that kind of that's kind of bad for the football players that have to be playing on Thanksgiving Day.
所以这对在感恩节当天必须比赛的橄榄球运动员来说有点不公平。

232
Yeah, but they get all hungry, you know, out there on the field that they get to go home and eat a big and have a big meal.
是的，但他们在场上会很饿，之后可以回家吃一顿丰盛的晚餐。

It's very, very interesting.

We'll put some pictures of the food that's that's that is commonly served on this holiday.
