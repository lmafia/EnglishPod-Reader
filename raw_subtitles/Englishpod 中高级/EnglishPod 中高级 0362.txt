好的，接下来，我们感到焦虑，但我们也感到另一种兴奋。

46
We are ecstatic.
我们感到兴奋。

47
All right, so while anxious is a bad feeling, ecstatic is a really good feeling.

56
I'm really happy.

57
Okay.
好的。

58

那你感到与什么分开？

所以这个人基本上是在说他正在服用的药物让他感到失控。

147
Right.
对。

148
Exactly.
正是如此。

149
So they are causing chaos, to cause chaos, to cause nothing in control and on your hormones.
所以它们造成了混乱，导致失控和荷尔蒙的波动。

150
So, but what does hormones have to do with your mood?
但是，荷尔蒙和你的情绪有什么关系？

153
Women have different hormones from men, but they affect the way that we feel.

So oftentimes you could say that I'm in a bad mood because of my hormones.

Pregnant women are very famous for having mood swings, happy, sad, angry, because they have more hormones in their bodies that they're not used to.

156
And so they cannot control the way that they feel.

157
That's right.
没错。

158
So an example is if a man has too much of one hormone, like testosterone is a hormone, then this person will usually be very aggressive, right?
所以一个例子是，如果一个男性有过多的某种荷尔蒙，比如睾酮是一种荷尔蒙，那么这个人通常会非常具有攻击性，对吧？

159
That's right.

163
Or emotional.

所以这就是我们谈论混乱和荷尔蒙。

167
Now, when we talked about mood swings, we take it as a noun, right?
现在，当我们谈论情绪波动时，我们把它当作名词，对吧？

168
You have mood swings.
你有情绪波动。

169
But then at the end of the dialogue, we say, well, maybe your mood will swing positively.

170
So now we're talking, it's separate.
所以现在我们在谈论，它是分开的。

We're taking swing as a verb.

178
Maybe it will become a good mood.

179
And so to swing here is the verb.
所以这里的波动是动词。

180
You can maybe try and encourage your mood to swing.
你可以尝试鼓励你的情绪波动。

181
Okay.
好的。

182
So to be clear, mood swings are a noun.
所以为了明确，情绪波动是名词。

183
But then in this last part, we put the verb to swing to kind of explain where mood swings comes from, right?
但在最后这一部分，我们使用动词波动来解释情绪波动的来源，对吧？

184
So the noun mood swings.
所以名词情绪波动。

185
Now you understand that it's kind of like a pendulum and it's swinging back and forth and you're changing constantly.
现在你明白这就像一个摆锤，它在来回摆动，你在不断变化。

186
Exactly.
正是如此。

187
All right.
好的。

188
So let's take a listen to the dialogue one last time.
所以我们最后再听一遍对话。

189
Are you okay?
你还好吗？

190
You seem a bit anxious.
你看起来有点焦虑。

191
Yeah, I'm okay.
是的，我还好。

192
I've been having a lot of mood swings lately.
最近我情绪波动很大。

193
I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones.
我想这和我医生开给我的药有关，这些药让我的荷尔蒙失控。

194
So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next?
你是说你一会儿感到兴奋，一会儿又感到沮丧？

195
Yeah, it's weird.
是的，这很奇怪。

196
For example, just this morning, I was feeling detached and lonely, even though there was really no reason to feel that way.
比如，就在今天早上，我感到很孤独和疏离，尽管其实没有理由这样感觉。

197
Well, maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident, brave and hopeful.
嗯，也许你的情绪会好转，你会感到自信、勇敢和充满希望。

198
I hope you're right.
我希望你说得对。

199
All right.
好的。

200
So talking about moods, now there are certain, well, maybe like conditions where your mood is negatively affecting your life.
说到情绪，现在有些情况，可能是你的情绪对生活产生了负面影响。

201
Like, for example, a person that suffers from anxiety.
比如，一个有焦虑症的人。

202
That's right.
没错。

203
So some people have anxiety disorders and this means that they're always worried about something, right?
有些人有焦虑障碍，这意味着他们总是担心某些事情，对吧？

204
You know, so they're always anxious, always anxious.
你知道，他们总是感到焦虑，总是焦虑。

205
So people who are anxious often tap their fingers or their pencils or their foot, talk quickly.
所以焦虑的人常常会敲打手指、铅笔或脚，快速说话。

206
So anxiety, it's not fun to feel anxious and you can only imagine.
焦虑的感觉不好，你可以想象。

207
So a lot of times these people who have anxiety problems, they will see their psychiatrist and they will try and get some medicine, some pills to help regulate their emotions, to help them feel in control.
所以很多有焦虑问题的人会去看精神科医生，试图得到一些药物，帮助调节情绪，让他们感到掌控。

208
So that I think is the most interesting thing for me is because your mood is actually very much dependent on what's going on chemically in your body.
我觉得最有趣的是，你的情绪实际上很大程度上取决于你身体内的化学反应。

209
So as you say, you could actually balance out maybe if you're feeling too anxious with drugs, you can actually make you feel less anxious because of the chemicals.
正如你所说，如果你感到过于焦虑，药物可以帮助你减轻焦虑，因为化学物质的作用。

210
Exactly.
确切地说。

211
And I think it's also important to remember that it's not just drugs that you take.
我认为还要记住，不仅仅是你服用的药物。

212
Sometimes people like to exercise and that helps them feel relaxed and calm because when you exercise, actually, your body produces certain chemicals that help you feel happy.
有时人们喜欢锻炼，这有助于他们放松和冷静，因为当你锻炼时，身体会产生某些化学物质，让你感到快乐。

213
Or when you eat.
或者当你吃东西时。

214
Sometimes when you haven't eaten, you notice that you're very, very cranky.
有时当你没吃东西时，你会发现自己非常烦躁。

215
Oh, God, why are you doing this?
哦，天哪，你为什么这样？

216
Why are you being like this?
你为什么这样？

217
And you eat and all of a sudden, oh, your body chemistry starts to change and so you feel better.
然后你吃东西，突然间，你的身体化学开始变化，你感觉好多了。

218
I heard that some people that suffer from anxiety disorders will be also compulsive eaters because they're nervous.
我听说一些有焦虑障碍的人也会因为紧张而强迫性进食。

219
So you know this, that some people eat when they're nervous.
所以你知道，有些人在紧张时会吃东西。

220
This is one of the side effects possibly, right?
这可能是一个副作用，对吧？

221
It is.
是的。

222
I've heard this too, that a lot of people who are nervous or who are anxious, they overeat.
我也听说过，很多紧张或焦虑的人会过度进食。

223
That means they eat too much.
这意味着他们吃得太多。

224
Even when they're not hungry.
即使他们并不饿。

225
Even when they're not hungry.
即使他们并不饿。

226
And this actually has a very large effect on your body because obviously, like I said, your body chemistry affects your mood.
这实际上对你的身体有很大的影响，因为显然，正如我所说，你的身体化学影响你的情绪。

227
So if you eat too much, your body maybe reacts negatively and you're even less happy.
所以如果你吃得太多，你的身体可能会产生负面反应，你会更不快乐。

228
It happens to me sometimes in the movie theater, like a really good scene or I'm nervous or there's an action sequence and I'm just eating that popcorn up and I'm already really, really thirsty, but I just can't stop.
有时在电影院里发生这种事，比如一个很好的场景，或者我很紧张，或者有动作场面，我就不停地吃爆米花，尽管我已经非常口渴，但我就是停不下来。

229
That's funny.
这很有趣。
