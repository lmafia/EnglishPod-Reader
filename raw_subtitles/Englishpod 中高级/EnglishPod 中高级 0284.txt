Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.
大家好，欢迎来到EnglishPod。

2
My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

3
My name is Catherine.
我叫Catherine。

4
And today we have an intermediate level lesson for you.
今天我们为你们准备了一节中级课程。

5
It's kind of about cars, right?
这节课有点关于汽车，对吧？

6
That's right.
没错。

7
So today we are taking our car to the mechanic.
所以今天我们要把车送去修理工那里。

8
And we're just going to check things and make sure that our car is okay.
我们只是检查一下，确保我们的车没问题。

9
All right, so we're going to learn a lot of really great words that have to do with cars and what happens when cars break down.
好的，我们将学习很多与汽车及汽车故障相关的好词汇。

10
So let's listen to our dialogue.
现在让我们听听对话。

11
Welcome to Al's Garage.
欢迎来到Al的车库。

12
What seems to be the problem?
请问有什么问题？

13
No problem at all.
完全没有问题。

14
I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition.
我正在进行一次长途旅行，想确保我的车处于良好的机械状态。

15
Very wise decision.
非常明智的决定。

16
When was the last time you had a tune-up?
上次保养是什么时候？

17
Not that long ago.
不久前。

18
I think it was four months ago.
我想是四个月前。

19
We usually recommend that you bring your car in every 5,000 kilometers.
我们通常建议每5000公里来一次保养。

20
Why?
为什么？

21
I mean, what exactly do you do to a car?
我是说，您到底对汽车做什么？

22
That you need to check it so often?
为什么需要这么频繁检查？

23
First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter.
首先，我们会更换机油和油滤。

24
If you don't do this, it can cause your engine to wear faster.
如果不这样做，可能会导致发动机磨损加快。

25
And that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves.
这意味着您可能需要更换活塞和进气阀。

26
I see.
我明白了。

27
What else?
还有什么？

28
We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid.
我们还会检查火花塞、燃油滤和其他油位，比如液压油。

29
We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones.
我们还会检查离合器和刹车，以确定何时需要更换。

30
Okay.
好的。

31
Well, when you put it that way, it doesn't seem like a waste of time and money.
嗯，您这么说，似乎并不是浪费时间和金钱。

32
Trust me.
相信我。

33
Regular tune-ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid breakdowns.
定期保养会让您的车运行顺畅，避免故障。

34
Alright, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

35
So, a very simple dialogue with the mechanic explaining to the client about why you need to take care of your car.
这是一个非常简单的对话，修理工向客户解释了为什么需要照顾汽车。

36
So, he mentioned a couple of very technical words in here.
他提到了一些非常专业的词汇。

37
Let's take a look at those on language takeaway.
让我们在语言收获中看看这些。

38
Language takeaway.
语言收获。

39
The first phrase we're looking at today is tune-up.
我们今天要看的第一个短语是保养。

40
So, a tune-up is a thing, it's a noun, and it's something you do to check your car.
保养是一种名词，是您用来检查汽车的事情。

41
Right, so you take your car for a tune-up, or you get a tune-up.
对，所以您把车送去保养，或者您进行保养。

42
Now, this is for your car, and this basically means to check that your car is okay and replace any very easy things around the car.
这适用于您的车，基本上意味着检查您的车是否正常，并更换一些非常简单的东西。

43
So, you don't normally get a tune-up when your car is broken.
所以，通常在车坏了的时候不会进行保养。

44
You get a tune-up when your car is okay.
车正常时才会进行保养。

45
That's right, that's right.
没错，没错。

46
So, the mechanic explained some of the things that you do when you get a tune-up.
所以，修理工解释了一些进行保养时要做的事情。

47
So, for example, he said that they change the motor oil.
例如，他说他们会更换机油。

48
Okay, so like it sounds, motor oil is oil for your motor.
好的，机油顾名思义是为发动机提供的油。

49
That's right.
没错。

50
But there are other kinds of oil as well, and oil is oftentimes put into the car, and then sometimes it falls out.
但还有其他类型的油，油通常会加到车里，有时会流出。

51
And so, what's that thing that catches the oil when it comes down?
那么，是什么东西在油流下来时接住油呢？

52
It's called an oil pan.
叫做油底壳。

53
An oil pan.
油底壳。

54
So, yes, as you say, there are different types of oils.
是的，正如您所说，有不同类型的油。

55
Cooking oil is obviously for cooking, for eating.
食用油显然是用于烹饪和食用的。

56
But motor oil is not for eating, it's for your motor.
但机油不是用来吃的，它是为您的发动机准备的。

57
But we also have to change the oil filter.
但我们还需要更换油滤。

58
Now, this is an important part that often gets mentioned at tune-ups.
这是保养时经常提到的重要部分。

59
That's right.
没错。

60
So, the word filter here, you have the verb to filter.
所以，这里的“滤”字，您有动词“过滤”。

61
In this case, we also have a noun called a filter.
在这种情况下，我们还有一个名词叫“滤”。

62
So, what this device does, it collects maybe dirt or rocks and dust or anything that you don't want to be in your engine.
这个装置的作用是收集您不希望出现在发动机中的污垢、石头和灰尘。

63
And specifically, maybe if the oil is a little bit dirty.
特别是，如果油有点脏。

64
Right, so an oil filter makes sure that the oil in your motor is not going to harm your motor.
对，所以油滤确保您发动机中的油不会伤害您的发动机。

65
And we also have a couple of interesting things like the fuel filter.
我们还有一些有趣的东西，比如燃油滤。

66
Now, how is this different from the oil filter?
那么，这与油滤有什么不同？

67
It's pretty much the same thing.
基本上是一样的。

68
The only difference is that this filter specifically cleans the gasoline in your car.
唯一的区别是这个滤专门清洁您车里的汽油。

69
Okay, similar object.
好的，类似的物体。

70
After that, we have something very different.
之后，我们有一些非常不同的东西。

71
These are spark plugs.
这些是火花塞。

72
That's right.
没错。

73
These are small little devices that, as the name says, create a spark.
这些是小装置，正如名字所说，产生火花。

74
This is how your engine goes.
这就是您的发动机运转的方式。

75
This is how your car moves.
这就是您的车移动的方式。

76
You have a spark and then everything starts running.
您有一个火花，然后一切开始运转。

77
Exactly.
正是如此。

78
Spark plugs are actually quite important, right?
火花塞实际上非常重要，对吧？

79
That's right.
没错。

80
So, a spark is a very quick flash of light that comes out.
火花是非常快速的光闪烁。

81
That's right.
没错。

82
It's not a long light.
这不是长时间的光。

83
It's just a spark.
这只是一个火花。

84
So, maybe when I strike a match or I use a lighter, there's a spark and that's what starts the fire.
所以，也许当我划火柴或使用打火机时，会有一个火花，这就是点燃火焰的原因。

85
That's right.
没错。

86
That's exactly right.
正是如此。

87
So, a spark plug.
所以，火花塞。

88
And now, we also check the oil levels of our car and that's a very important thing as well.
现在，我们还检查汽车的油位，这也是非常重要的事情。

89
Yeah, that's right.
是的，没错。

90
So, the oil level is something that you test with a long stick and you put it into the engine, the oil container, and make sure that there is enough oil.
油位是您用一根长棒测试的，您将其放入发动机的油箱中，确保有足够的油。

91
Because if there's not enough oil, you can have very serious car trouble.
因为如果油不够，您可能会遇到非常严重的汽车问题。

92
That's right.
没错。

93
So, a lot of technical or mechanical things that we're taking a look at.
所以，我们正在查看很多技术或机械方面的东西。

94
Why don't we go back, let's review all these words and we'll be back in a bit.
我们回去复习一下这些词汇，稍后再见。

95

So now we've prepared three key phrases for you.
现在我们为你准备了三个关键短语。

119
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.
让我们现在在流利度构建器上看看这些。

120
Fluency Builder This first phrase is something that you often hear in the service industry.
流利度构建器 第一个短语是你在服务行业常常听到的。

121
So anytime you're going to a shop, or maybe in this case a mechanic, the mechanic will say to you, What seems to be the problem?
所以每当你去商店，或者在这种情况下去修车店，技师会问你，发生了什么问题？

122
That's right.
没错。

123
So this is a question.
这是一个问题。

124
And we're saying, What is wrong with your car?
我们在问，你的车有什么问题？

125
Or maybe if you go to the doctor, the doctor will say, What seems to be the problem?

127
So this means, What's wrong with you?

It just means, What's going on?
它的意思就是，发生了什么事？

132

134
It's very polite though, right?
这很礼貌，对吧？

It's better than saying, What's wrong with you?
比起说，你有什么问题要好。

136
No, yeah, you wouldn't want to say, What's wrong with you?
不，是的，你不想说，你有什么问题？

137
That's very rude.
那样很粗鲁。

138
So what seems to be the problem is a much more polite way of saying things.
所以，发生了什么问题，是更礼貌的说法。

139
Very good.
非常好。

140
And well, the mechanic after explaining everything, he said that, You know, doing all these things, changing the filters, will keep the car running smoothly.
而且，技师在解释完一切后说，知道吗，做这些事情，更换滤芯，会让车运行顺畅。

141
Okay, so we're not talking about running like a marathon here.
好的，所以我们不是在谈论像马拉松那样的运行。

142
We're talking about using your car.
我们在谈论使用你的车。

143
And so when we turn a car on, we don't say that the car is operating.
所以当我们启动汽车时，我们不会说车在运转。

144
Really, we say it's running.
其实，我们说它在运行。

145
So that means that it's in use.
这意味着它在使用中。

146
That's right.
没错。

147
That I've turned the key and the motor is running.
我已经转动钥匙，发动机在运转。

152
It's running smoothly.

153
If it's going zzzz, it's not running smoothly.

154
That's right.
没错。

155
And obviously if you don't take care of your car, what may happen is you may suffer a breakdown.
显然，如果你不照顾你的车，可能会发生故障。

156
Okay, remember this phrase as a phrase because obviously things can break.
好的，记住这个短语，因为显然东西会坏。

157
You know, I broke a glass.
你知道，我打破了一个玻璃。

158
But as far as cars are concerned, you say, you know, A car breaks down.
但就汽车而言，你说，车坏了。

159
Or I want to avoid breakdowns.
或者我想避免故障。

160
And so this is something that happens when your car no longer works properly.

161
That's right.
没错。

162
So you say my car broke down yesterday.
所以你说，我的车昨天坏了。

163
And I had to call a friend to pick me up.
我不得不叫朋友来接我。

164
Because you know, when your car breaks down, you can't go anywhere.
因为你知道，当你的车坏了，你就无法去任何地方。

165

对，你不能再开它了。

166
Very good.
非常好。

167
So to break down.
所以，故障。

168
Now obviously if you get a flat tire, that doesn't really mean that your car broke down.
当然，如果你轮胎漏气，那并不意味着你的车坏了。

169
No, a flat tire is a bit different.
不，漏气的轮胎有点不同。

170
That means that you have to replace the tire.
这意味着你需要更换轮胎。

171
But when your car breaks down, it means that something inside the car like a piece of it, yeah, the transmission or the spark plugs or the engine, some part of it isn't working right.
但当你的车坏了，意味着车内某个部件，比如变速器、火花塞或发动机，某个部分工作不正常。

172
And you have to get it fixed or replaced.
你必须修理或更换它。

173
That's right.
没错。

I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition.
我正在进行一次长途旅行，想确保我的车处于良好的机械状态。

181
Very wise decision.
非常明智的决定。

182
When was the last time you had a tune up?
你上次做保养是什么时候？

183
Not that long ago.
不久前。

184
I think it was four months ago.
我想是四个月前。

185
We usually recommend that you bring your car in every 5,000 kilometers.
我们通常建议每5000公里带车来检查一次。

186
Why?
为什么？

187
I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often?
我是说，你到底对车做什么，为什么需要这么频繁检查？

188
First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter.
首先，我们会更换机油和油滤。

189
If you don't do this, it can cause your engine to wear faster.
如果不这样做，可能会导致发动机磨损加快。

190
And that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves.
这意味着你可能需要更换活塞和进气阀。

191
I see.
我明白了。

192
What else?
还有什么？

193
We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid.
我们还会检查火花塞、燃油滤和其他油位，比如液压油。

好的，嗯，换个角度看，这似乎并不是浪费时间和金钱。

196
Trust me.
相信我。

197
Regular tune-ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid breakdowns.
定期保养会让你的车运行顺畅，避免故障。

198
Okay, so talking about cars and tune-ups.
好吧，谈到汽车和保养。

199
Now, when we go to the mechanic, you saw that he said, Welcome to Al's garage.
现在，当我们去修车店时，你看到他是怎么说的，欢迎来到阿尔的车库。

200
So a mechanic shop is usually called a garage.
所以修车店通常叫做车库。

201
That's right.
没错。

202
And as you will know, a garage is a place where we store cars.
正如你所知道的，车库是我们存放汽车的地方。

203
So sometimes people park their cars in the street.
所以有时人们会把车停在街上。

204
But if you have a special place to protect your car from the rain or the snow, like a room for your car, that's called a garage.
但如果你有一个特殊的地方来保护你的车免受雨雪侵袭，比如一个车房，那就叫做车库。

205
And this might be confusing, but a store, like you say, for a mechanic is a garage also because there's a door that opens up the same way.
这可能会让人困惑，但像你说的，修车的地方也是车库，因为有一扇门是向上开的。

206
It opens up, not out.
它是向上开的，而不是向外开的。

207
And you pull the car inside, and then the mechanic can fix the car.
你把车拉进去，然后修车工就可以修车。

208
And so I think that's why it's a garage.
所以我想这就是为什么叫车库。

209
There's room for many cars inside.
里面有很多车的空间。

210
That's right.
没错。

211
So you take, or if your car is at the mechanic shop, you would say, Oh, my car is at the garage.
所以如果你的车在修车店，你会说，哦，我的车在车库。

212
It's getting fixed.
它正在修理中。

213
Yeah, that's right.
是的，没错。

214
But it's a little bit different from the place where you would buy a car.
但这和你买车的地方有点不同。

215
A place where you would buy a car is a car lot, L-O-T, lot.
买车的地方叫做汽车展销场，L-O-T，展销场。

216
And that's a place where they have many, many cars outside, like in a big parking lot.
那是一个外面有很多车的地方，就像一个大停车场。

217
That's what we call a lot.
这就是我们所说的展销场。

218
And you can pick a car and buy it and test it.
你可以挑选一辆车，买下它并试驾。

219
But a place where you fix a car, that's special, that's called a garage or a repair shop.
但修车的地方是特别的，叫做车库或修理店。

220
Now something that's very interesting and very common in places like the States and Canada is that there are actually used car lots where you can see many cars that are used and they're trying to sell.
现在，在像美国和加拿大这样的地方，有一个非常有趣且常见的现象，就是实际上有二手车展销场，你可以看到很多二手车，他们在尝试出售。

221
But obviously, in many other countries, it's not very common to see a used car lot.
但显然，在许多其他国家，看到二手车展销场并不常见。

222
Well, I think in America, people like to buy new cars.
嗯，我认为在美国，人们喜欢买新车。

223
And that means that every couple of years, they sell their old car.
这意味着每隔几年，他们就会卖掉旧车。

224
But that car is still good.
但那辆车仍然很好。

225
You can still use a car from 2005.
你仍然可以使用2005年的车。

226
In fact, when I had a car, it was from 1991.
事实上，当我有一辆车时，它是1991年的。

227
It was 16 years old at the time.
当时它已经16岁了。

228
And so, you know, I could still drive it.
所以，你知道，我仍然可以开它。

229
It was a good car.
它是一辆好车。

230
And I think that as long as you can drive it, you can sell it.
我认为只要你能开它，你就可以卖掉它。

231
This is actually another interesting thing about cars in general, in places like this, is that there are so many cars, and as you say, people are often buying new cars every year or trading their cars every five years, let's say.
这实际上是关于汽车的另一个有趣的事情，在这样的地方，汽车数量非常多，正如你所说，人们每年经常购买新车，或者每五年更换一次车。

232
Used cars are very, very, very inexpensive.
二手车非常非常便宜。

233
I mean, you can get a car for like $500 sometimes.
我的意思是，有时你可以以500美元的价格买到一辆车。

234
That's right.
没错。

235
And in a lot of cases, it doesn't make sense to buy a new car because it's going to be less valuable in one day.
在很多情况下，买新车是没有意义的，因为它在一天内就会贬值。

236
But a used car, as long as it doesn't have any problems, like you don't want to buy a car that has faulty spark plugs or whatever, but as long as it runs smoothly, I think that it's a very good investment to buy a used car.
但只要二手车没有任何问题，比如你不想买有故障火花塞的车，只要它运行顺畅，我认为买二手车是一个非常好的投资。

237
Very good.
非常好。

238
So it's interesting because in many countries, used cars are actually not that much cheaper.
所以很有趣的是，在许多国家，二手车实际上并没有便宜多少。

239
So why don't you come to our website, EnglishPod.com.
所以为什么不来我们的网站，EnglishPod.com。

240
Let us know if taking your car to the mechanic is very expensive or buying a used car is still relatively expensive.
让我们知道把车送到修车店是否非常昂贵，或者购买二手车是否仍然相对昂贵。

241
We hope to see you guys there and until next time.
我们希望在那里见到你们，直到下次再见。
