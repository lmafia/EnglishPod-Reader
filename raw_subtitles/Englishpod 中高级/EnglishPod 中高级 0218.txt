84
So now you know.
所以现在你知道了。

85
Now moving on, we have a very common legal term.
现在继续，我们有一个非常常见的法律术语。

86
When people are getting married, they want to sign sometimes a prenup.
当人们结婚时，他们有时想签一个婚前协议。

87
Yeah, you said it's common.
是的，你说这很常见。

88
You hear this a lot in movies and TV.
你在电影和电视中经常听到。

89
Yeah, with celebrities.
是的，关于名人。

90
Yeah, you read about celebrities.
是的，你会读到名人。

91
So basically, a prenup is a short way of saying a prenuptial agreement.
所以基本上，婚前协议是婚前协议的简写。

92
Nuptial means having to do with marriage.
婚姻意味着与婚姻有关。

93
So basically, if you sign a prenup, you are agreeing to certain conditions before you get married.
所以基本上，如果你签了婚前协议，你是在同意在结婚前的某些条件。

94
That's right.
没错。

95
It's a contract between future husband and future wife about what happens if they divorce.
这是未来丈夫和未来妻子之间的合同，关于他们离婚时会发生什么。

96
For example, I decided not to get a prenup with my fiance because I don't think we'll get divorced.
例如，我决定不和我的未婚夫签婚前协议，因为我认为我们不会离婚。

97
But maybe he decided to get a prenup because in case they divorce, he wants to keep his car.
但也许他决定签婚前协议，因为如果他们离婚，他想保留他的车。

98
Right, so it usually happens a lot with celebrities, as we say, because they have a lot of money.
对，所以这通常发生在名人身上，因为他们有很多钱。

99
And if they get divorced, then usually it can get complicated, how much money the spouse gets, etc.
如果他们离婚，通常会变得复杂，配偶能得到多少钱等等。

100
So maybe their prenuptial agreement or prenup will be that if they get divorced, the wife may get maybe a million dollars instead of a hundred million dollars.
所以他们的婚前协议可能是，如果他们离婚，妻子可能会得到一百万美元，而不是一亿美元。

101
Exactly.
正是如此。

102
It's a way many people protect themselves financially in case of divorce.
这是许多人在离婚时保护自己财务的一种方式。

103
Very good.
非常好。

104
Now moving on, another legal term and related to money is an alimony.
现在继续，另一个与金钱相关的法律术语是赡养费。

105
Okay, so let's look at the context of this word.
好的，让我们看看这个词的上下文。

106
Joanne is talking and she says, My lawyer tells me you've accepted our alimony proposal.
Joanne在说，她的律师告诉我你接受了我们的赡养费提议。

107
Alimony.
赡养费。

108
So this is probably something to do with money, right?
所以这可能与金钱有关，对吧？

109
So she said that her lawyer has proposed an alimony and that's usually a settlement, an amount of money that you agree on when you get divorced.
她说她的律师提议了赡养费，这通常是离婚时达成的和解金额。

110
Right, so this is exactly it.

111
In a divorce, this is how much money one person will pay the other.
在离婚中，这就是一个人将支付给另一个人的金额。

112
That's right.
没错。

113
So if two people are married and when they get divorced, their alimony may be the husband.
所以如果两个人结婚，离婚时，赡养费可能是丈夫支付的。

114
If he's got a lot of money, he will pay an alimony of $500,000.
如果他有很多钱，他将支付50万美元的赡养费。

115
Right, and so this is different from property, which is the next thing.
对，所以这与财产不同，财产是下一个话题。

116
Division of property means that you talk about who will receive the car, the house, things like that.
财产分割意味着你讨论谁将获得汽车、房子等。

117
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

118
So very complicated situations when you're getting divorced, prenups and alimony.

130
Okay, so in the care of the grandmother.
好的，所以在祖母的照顾下。

131
That's right.
没错。

132
So usually, as well, when people get divorced, somebody gets custody of the children.
所以通常，当人们离婚时，某人会获得孩子的监护权。

133
Right, so he wants custody, but he doesn't have a job, so she will receive custody.
对，所以他想要监护权，但他没有工作，所以她将获得监护权。

134
You could say that.
你可以这么说。

135
In this case, though, we're talking about custody of pets, animals.
不过在这种情况下，我们谈论的是宠物的监护权，动物。

141
Yes, who gets to keep the children, who gets to keep the pets.
是的，谁能保留孩子，谁能保留宠物。

142
Now, moving on, and a little bit away from legal terms, they were dividing up their property and saying, well, I get to keep this, you get to keep that.
现在，继续，稍微远离法律术语，他们在分割财产，说，我保留这个，你保留那个。

143
And Joanne said, I'm keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.

It's an old thing, and that's what antique means, right?

留声机是你在电影中看到的那种播放旧黑胶唱片的机器，带有一个大喇叭，声音在里面回响。

所以在19世纪，20世纪初，人们没有CD、MP3或iPod。

This is how they listened to music.

188
All right, so this is our first phrase in Fluency Builder.
结束这件事，或者说结束它。

To get this over with, or to get it over with.

190
Okay, so let's take that as a phrase, and to get something over with means let's just finish it quickly, let's stop delaying.

All right, we hear this phrase all the time.
好吧，我们经常听到这个短语。

Okay, so for example, if someone's giving a speech, they may be dragging it out.

223
So if someone's giving a very long speech, you're like, Oh my God, he's dragging this speech out so long.

所以当杰夫说我们的关系岌岌可危时，他在说，我们经常争吵，我们有问题，这段关系不行。

237

246

所以如果你要求饮料加冰，那是不同的。

247
But if you describe yourself or your company or your relationship as being on the rocks, it means you're having a tough time.

But I do hope that when you're practicing speaking, use this phrase a lot because it's really, really colloquial like you say, Marco.

So a very interesting dialogue all about divorce.
所以这是一个关于离婚的非常有趣的对话。

310
Now, this is a very common situation nowadays in many countries such as the United States or Europe.
现在，这在许多国家，如美国或欧洲，是一种非常普遍的情况。

311
Divorce rates are very high lately, like in the past 10-20 years.
最近离婚率很高，像过去10-20年一样。

312
Yeah, they do say that since maybe the 70s or 80s divorce rates have been on the rise.
是的，他们确实说自70年代或80年代以来，离婚率一直在上升。

313
I think the average now in America is about 50%.
我认为现在美国的平均离婚率大约是50%。

314
Yeah, it's like 5 in 10 marriages end in divorce.
是的，差不多每10对婚姻中就有5对离婚。

315
That's right.
没错。

316
And then from what I understand or I read once, I think out of those 50% that get divorced, if they remarry, again, the probabilities of those that get remarried are again half.
然后根据我了解或曾经读到的，我认为在那些离婚的50%中，如果他们再婚，重新结婚的概率又是二分之一。

317
So, most likely people will get divorced at least twice.
所以，大多数人可能会至少离婚两次。

318
That's true.
这是真的。

319
Although, sometimes you meet people who got married when they were very very young and they realized that they grew up a little bit and their personality changed or their goals changed and they divorced that one time but then later in life when they marry again they know who they are.
不过，有时你会遇到那些在非常年轻时结婚的人，他们意识到自己长大了一点，性格或目标发生了变化，他们离婚了一次，但后来在生活中再婚时，他们知道自己是谁。

320
They get married again and it's better.
他们再次结婚，情况会更好。

321
So, I think the situations are all quite different but it is true that there are a lot of divorces in America.
所以，我认为情况各不相同，但在美国确实有很多离婚。

322
What about Ecuador though?
那厄瓜多尔呢？

323
I mean is the divorce rate similar?
我是说离婚率相似吗？

324
No, not really.
不，实际上并不是。

325
I think people are still a little bit more old fashioned in that sense.
我认为人们在这方面仍然有点保守。

326
Like it was before, you know it was even a little bit taboo to be divorced.
就像以前一样，你知道，离婚甚至有点禁忌。

327
But I don't think people get divorced as often.
但我认为人们离婚的频率并不高。

328
Especially if people have been together for quite a while.
特别是如果人们在一起很长时间。

329
That's one of the things that surprises me a lot is I've met people who have been married 20-30 years and then get divorced.
让我感到惊讶的是，我遇到过那些结婚20-30年后才离婚的人。

330
It's like you've been through the toughest times you've pretty much beat the odds and why do you get divorced at such a late age?
就像你经历了最艰难的时刻，几乎打破了几率，为什么在这么晚的年龄离婚？

331
Yeah, it does seem counterintuitive but it's possible that they were unhappy for that time and they didn't want to affect their children's lives.
是的，这似乎是反直觉的，但他们可能在那段时间不快乐，不想影响孩子的生活。

332
And so when their children go to college or leave they say, okay now I can make a big decision.
所以当他们的孩子上大学或离开时，他们说，好吧，现在我可以做一个重大决定。

333
I know in countries for example such as Chile, divorce is still illegal.
我知道在一些国家，比如智利，离婚仍然是非法的。

334
I think in the Philippines as well.
我想在菲律宾也是。

335
Really?
真的？

336
Yeah, it's still illegal to get divorced.
是的，离婚仍然是非法的。

337
Is that because they're very religious countries?
这是因为他们是非常宗教的国家吗？

338
I know Chile is not really that religious.
我知道智利并不是特别宗教。

339
I don't know what it is exactly by law but a lot of people... I think it may be legal now.
我不太清楚法律上是什么，但很多人……我想现在可能是合法的。

340
I can't really remember very well.
我记不太清楚了。

341
I think one of our Chilean listeners can help us out here.
我想我们的智利听众可以帮我们解答。

342
But I know a lot of people used to annul their marriages because of this.
但我知道很多人因为这个原因选择宣告婚姻无效。

343
I see.
我明白了。

344
So they would be like, oh I put the wrong address.
所以他们会说，哦，我填错了地址。

345
So no, this marriage is not valid.

346
Or I spelled my name wrong.
