13
You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo, do you?

14
Well, I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told them came true.
嗯，我有很多朋友去过算命师那里算命，大多数算命师告诉他们的事情都成真了。

15
Of course it does.

16
They tell you general and obvious things like that you'll be successful or have a big house.
他们告诉你一些普遍而明显的事情，比如你会成功或拥有大房子。

17
I think most of the times they're just scam artists.
我觉得大多数时候他们只是骗子。

18
Well, historically, it's a practice that many cultures share.
嗯，从历史上看，这是许多文化共同的做法。

19
Reading the tarot cards.

20
In the East, they would even read tea leaves.
在东方，他们甚至会解读茶叶。

21
I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar and then read your ashes.
我甚至听说有些人让你抽烟，然后解读你的烟灰。

22
All superstitious nonsense.

23
I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say just for kicks.

26
Alright, we're back.

27
So a lot of interesting things here.
这里有很多有趣的事情。

28
Let's take a look at some of those words on language takeaway.
让我们看看一些语言要点中的单词。

29
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

30
So in language takeaway today, we are focusing on some words that describe fortune telling but also the different ways of doing so.
今天的语言要点，我们关注一些描述算命的单词，以及不同的做法。

31
The first word we have is actually a name for a person who can read the future.
第一个单词实际上是指能解读未来的人的名字。

32
Right, Marco?
对吧，Marco？

33
That's right.
没错。

34
A medium.
灵媒。

35
In the dialogue, we hear about a woman who is a medium and is very talented.
在对话中，我们听到一个非常有才华的女性灵媒。

36
Actually, a medium is interesting because a medium is a person who can communicate with the dead.
实际上，灵媒很有趣，因为灵媒是能与死者沟通的人。

37
That's right.
没错。

38
Or who can communicate with the other side.
或者能与另一边沟通的人。

39
And if you think about middle, medium, I mean they mean the same thing.
如果你想想中间，灵媒，我的意思是它们的意思是一样的。

40
It's someone who is in the middle of two things.
这是一个处于两者之间的人。

41
And so a medium can maybe transmit these different ideas or signals.
所以灵媒可能会传递这些不同的想法或信号。

42
Right, exactly.
对，没错。

43
So it's a person that basically communicates, as you say, with the dead or someone that can listen to people who are not here anymore.
所以这基本上是一个与死者沟通的人，或者能倾听不在这里的人。

44
But obviously they are a type of person that could also use this gift to tell your future or to have the people who are dead tell you what's going to happen in the future.
但显然，他们也可以利用这种能力来告诉你的未来，或者让死者告诉你未来会发生什么。

45
That's right.
没错。

46
And so another kind of person who would do something similar is a psychic.
另一种类似的人是算命师。

47
That's right.
没错。

48
Alright, now a psychic is a person who generally will read your future for you, will tell you the future.
好的，算命师是一个通常会为你解读未来的人。

49
Maybe the psychic will have a special tool like a crystal ball.
也许算命师会有一个特殊的工具，比如水晶球。

50
Just remember that in English, psych, like psychology, psychosis, has to do with your mind.
记住，在英语中，psych，像心理学，精神病，与心理有关。

51
That's right.
没错。

52
Alright, so a psychic uses their mind to find out things about you or your future.
好的，所以算命师用他们的头脑来了解关于你或你未来的事情。

53
That's right.
没错。

54
So sometimes psychics will claim that they can read your mind as well, right?
所以有时算命师会声称他们也能读懂你的心思，对吧？

55
It's a little scary.
这有点可怕。

56
So as you say, these are people who supposedly can tell you your future.
正如你所说，这些人据说能告诉你未来。

57
And as you say, they use different methods or different tools.
正如你所说，他们使用不同的方法或工具。

58
One of them is, for example, having your palms read.
其中之一，例如，算命。

59
Alright, so the psychic will go to you, Marco, and will look at your hand and will read your palm.
好的，算命师会走到你面前，Marco，看看你的手，解读你的手相。

60
Now, where on your hand is your palm?
现在，你手上的手掌在哪里？

61
It's on the other side, the side where you grab things with.
在另一边，就是你抓东西的那一面。

62
The inside, so the soft part.
里面，所以是柔软的部分。

63
And maybe on your palm, you have many different lines.
也许在你的手掌上，你有很多不同的线。

64
So the psychic will look at the lines and will say, Oh, well, this line is very long, so you will have a long, long life.
所以算命师会看这些线，说，哦，这条线很长，所以你会有很长的生命。

65
That's right.
没错。

66
So supposedly in your hands, you have lines that determine how much money you will have, or how many kids you will have, or how long you will live.
所以据说在你的手上，有线条决定你会有多少钱，或者你会有多少孩子，或者你会活多久。

67
So that's called a palm reading.
这叫做手相。

68
Or, I am going to have my palm read.
或者，我要去算命。

69
That's right.
没错。

70
Now the other person doesn't really believe in all that stuff, and says that they are just scam artists.
现在另一个人并不真的相信这些东西，说他们只是骗子。

71
So he's saying that the psychics or the mediums are just scam artists.
所以他说算命师或灵媒只是骗子。

72
Alright, so what is a scam artist?
好的，什么是骗子？

73
Well, a scam artist is not a real artist.
嗯，骗子并不是真正的艺术家。

74
Right, right.
对，没错。

75
A scam artist is a thief, someone who will maybe tell you a story, or who will lie to you to try and take your money.
骗子是小偷，可能会给你讲一个故事，或者对你撒谎，试图骗取你的钱。

76
That's right.
没错。

77
So he's not really like a robber, like somebody that will break into your house and take your things.
所以他并不是真正的抢劫者，比如会闯入你家拿走你东西的人。

78
No, he won't use a gun, maybe.
不，他可能不会用枪。

79
Hopefully not.
希望不会。

80
But he will tell you a story, or will lie to you in a way that makes you want to give him money.
但他会给你讲一个故事，或者以某种方式对你撒谎，让你想给他钱。

81
That's right.
没错。

82
So I don't know if any of you have ever received an email from someone who said, I am a wealthy person from a different part of the world, and I want you to give me money to help me so I can come to America, and these kinds of things where you don't know the person, he's probably lying to you, it's a very sad story.
所以我不知道你们是否曾收到过这样的电子邮件，发件人说，我是来自世界另一部分的富人，我希望你给我钱，以便我能来美国，这种你不认识的人，他可能在对你撒谎，很悲伤的故事。

83
They say, please give me money so I can come to visit you, or so I can come and have a good life.
他们说，请给我钱，这样我就可以来拜访你，或者我可以过上好日子。

84
That's a scam artist, because they probably don't have a bad life, they just want you to give them money.
这就是骗子，因为他们可能并没有过得很糟糕，他们只是想让你给他们钱。

85
That's right.
没错。

86
So that is a scam artist.
所以这就是骗子。

87
And what he went on to say about how all of these things, about fortune telling, about psychics and everything, is just superstitious nonsense.
他接着说，所有这些关于算命、算命师的事情，都是迷信的胡说八道。

88
So then the girl went on to explain in saying that it's not really true that many cultures do things like, for example, read the tarot cards.
然后女孩解释说，许多文化确实做一些事情，比如解读塔罗牌，这并不是真的。

89
All right, so we had palm reading first, maybe talking to dead people with a medium, but this is another tool that psychics use to communicate with maybe the dead or to understand the future.
好吧，我们首先有手相，也许是与灵媒交谈，但这是算命师用来与死者沟通或理解未来的另一种工具。

90
So we have tarot cards, and they're actually cards.
所以我们有塔罗牌，它们实际上是卡片。

91
You know, like playing cards, but they're a little bit different, right?
你知道，就像扑克牌，但它们有点不同，对吧？

92
They don't have diamonds and hearts, they have different pictures.
它们没有方块和红心，而是有不同的图案。

93
Right, they have pictures of, for example, a king or a queen, or a picture of a river, or different symbols, that basically the person who is getting their fortune read will take it and move them and shuffle them, and then will start flipping the cards over,
对，它们有国王或女王的图案，或者河流的图案，或不同的符号，基本上，算命的人会拿着这些卡片，移动并洗牌，然后开始翻卡片，

94
and then you will see, supposedly, what your future will be like.
然后你就会看到， supposedly，你的未来会是什么样子。

95
All right, so those are tarot cards.
好的，这就是塔罗牌。

96
But we have one more word here, and it actually comes from the friend who doesn't believe in these scam artists.
但我们这里还有一个单词，实际上是来自那个不相信这些骗子的朋友。

97
Right.
对。

98
It calls it all superstitious nonsense.
他称这些都是迷信的胡说八道。

99
That's right.
没错。

100
So a person that is superstitious believes in superstitions, and those are beliefs of good or bad luck.
所以一个迷信的人相信迷信，那些是关于好运或坏运的信仰。

101
Yeah, that's right.
是的，没错。

102
So if I believe that the number 13 is very, very bad, I will avoid the number 13.
所以如果我相信数字13非常非常糟糕，我会避免数字13。

103
I won't sit down and chair number 13, I won't buy a house on floor number 13, because I'm superstitious.
我不会坐在13号椅子上，也不会买13楼的房子，因为我迷信。

104
I believe that that number is bad luck.
我相信那个数字是坏运气。

105
That's right.
没错。

106
So many people believe that it's bad luck to break a mirror, or to walk under a ladder.
很多人相信打破镜子或在梯子下走是坏运气。

107
Yes, also many Americans believe it's bad luck to open an umbrella inside.
是的，还有很多美国人相信在室内打开伞是坏运气。

108
That's right.
没错。

109
So it's interesting because many cultures around the world have different types of superstitions, but we'll talk about that in a little bit.
所以很有趣，因为世界上许多文化有不同类型的迷信，但我们稍后会谈到这个。

110
