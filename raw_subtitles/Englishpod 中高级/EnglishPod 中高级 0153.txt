26
It's just that the holidays are coming up, and I won't be able to go home because I can't afford the airfare.

哦，天哪，假期期间最糟糕，因为你会想到所有的传统和你通常在家做的事情，而你却没有做。

51
So this is something we're going to talk more about a little bit later on, but let's take a look at some of the language that was used in Language Takeaway.
所以这是我们稍后会更多讨论的事情，但让我们看看在语言收获中使用的一些语言。

52
Language Takeaway.
语言收获。

53
This first one is key, right?
第一个是关键，对吧？

54
So when you move away from home, or when you move to a new place, you have a period of adjustment.
所以当你离开家，或者搬到一个新地方时，你会有一个适应期。

55
So adjustment is kind of finding the right balance or doing something so that you can kind of feel comfortable.
所以适应就是找到正确的平衡或做一些事情，让你感到舒适。

56
Okay, so you have to adjust to your new life, life away from home.
好吧，所以你必须适应你的新生活，远离家的生活。

57
Or your new environment.
或者你的新环境。

58
So many times people say, wow, moving to China must be a big adjustment.
所以很多时候人们会说，哇，搬到中国一定是个大适应。

59
So it means there's so many differences that it must take a long time to feel comfortable again.
所以这意味着有很多差异，可能需要很长时间才能再次感到舒适。

60
Okay, alright, so that's adjustment.
好吧，好的，这就是适应。

61
What else do we have?
还有什么？

62
Well, we've got this next phrase that's really important, I think, but often gets overlooked.
嗯，我觉得下一个短语非常重要，但常常被忽视。

63
We say the comforts of home, right?
我们说家的舒适，对吧？

64
Comforts of home.
家的舒适。

65
So comfort's pretty easy, right?
所以舒适很简单，对吧？

66
Feeling comfortable, so you have comfort.
感到舒适，所以你有舒适。

67
But the comforts of home are things that are different with every person.
但家的舒适是每个人都不同的东西。

68
But those are things that you have at your home or your childhood home or your parents' home that make you feel good and feel happy.
但这些是你在家、童年家或父母家中拥有的东西，让你感到良好和快乐。

69
So they're not only physical things or objects, right?
所以它们不仅仅是物理的东西或物品，对吧？

70
They can be like your mom's cooking or maybe even just spending time with your family.
它们可以是你妈妈的饭菜，或者只是和家人在一起的时间。

71
Right, or reading the newspaper with your dad or things that you're used to that you don't have anymore.
对，或者和你爸爸一起看报纸，或者你习惯的事情，而你现在没有了。

I could say, Marco, do you miss the comforts of home in Ecuador?
我可以问，Marco，你想念厄瓜多尔的家的舒适吗？

74
I mean, do you have anything that's really... Of course, of course.
我的意思是，你有什么真的... 当然，当然。

75
I think one of the main things is actually not living in the city.
我认为主要的事情之一实际上是没有住在城市里。

76
Because I used to live in the valley, a little bit further away and kind of almost countryside.
因为我以前住在山谷，离得远一点，几乎是乡村。

So that's one of the comforts of home that I miss.
所以这是我想念的家的舒适之一。

78
You're making me nostalgic and I've never even been.

怀旧。

82
It's a feeling.
这是一种感觉。

83
I'm feeling nostalgic or he's just really nostalgic.
我感到怀旧，或者他真的很怀旧。

84
And so to be nostalgic is to kind of think about a time before or, you know, think positively about something that you experienced before.
所以怀旧就是想起以前的时光，或者积极地想起你以前经历过的事情。

85
So it's not usually a bad thing.

87
Nostalgia is a good, warm, fond memory of something.
怀旧是对某种事情的美好、温暖的回忆。

90
Maybe a little bit sad because you miss those times.
可能有点伤感，因为你想念那些时光。

I loved, you know, summers in Chicago when it was hot and the kids would play in the sprinkler.
我喜欢，知道吗，夏天在芝加哥的时候，天气热，孩子们在喷洒器里玩。

94
And I had my dog and, you know, it's a happy feeling.
我有我的狗，知道吗，这是一种快乐的感觉。

95
Right, so nostalgia would be the noun and nostalgic would be the adjective.

97

130
Okay, let's hit the dance club or let's hit the dance floor tonight.

143

我们下一个词其实很有趣，因为它非常口语化，是一个“副翼”。

144
I can be your wingman tonight.
我今晚可以做你的副翼。

145
So wingman, you have to think about wing meaning side, not like a bird's wings.
所以副翼，你要想象wing的意思是侧面，而不是鸟的翅膀。

146

所以wing意味着侧面，副翼是一个会陪你去酒吧或俱乐部的人，帮助你找到约会对象或女孩或某人聊天。

好吧，所以这个人，副翼通常陪伴你，帮助你决定和哪个女孩聊天，或者甚至在俱乐部或餐厅或酒吧或其他地方介绍你给某人。

And so if a guy wants to go to a bar and he sees two girls, well, he has to have a friend to talk to the other girl.
所以如果一个男孩想去酒吧，他看到两个女孩，他必须有一个朋友去和另一个女孩聊天。

152
So wingman also helps in that sense.

153
He helps balance things.
他帮助平衡事情。

154
All right, so there's a whole science behind the wingman.
好吧，所以副翼背后有一整套科学。

155
Yeah, I'm sure if you look it up on Wikipedia, you'll find 10 pages of information.
是的，我敢肯定如果你在维基百科上查一下，你会找到10页的信息。

156
All right, so since they are going out tonight, they said it could be boys' night out.

好吧，这又是一个你经常听到的短语，尤其是在年轻人中。

158
Boys' night out and girls' night out.

所以这是仅限女孩或仅限男孩。

165
Boys' night out is only guys.
男孩之夜只有男孩。

166
Exactly.
正是。

167
And that's why this is funny because it's the girl who says, hey, let's have boys' night out and she's not really a boy.
这就是为什么这很有趣，因为是女孩说，嘿，我们来个男孩之夜，而她并不是真正的男孩。

168
All right, great.
好吧，太好了。

169
And well, he agreed to go out and everything, but he warned her about him going on a drinking binge.

好吧，这很重要。

171
A lot of people who are depressed or sad, when they drink, they drink a lot.
很多人在沮丧或悲伤时，喝酒时会喝很多。

175
And it's not healthy and we do not condone it.
