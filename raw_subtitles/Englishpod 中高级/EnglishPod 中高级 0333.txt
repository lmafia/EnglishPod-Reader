33
We've heard this already.
我们已经听说过这个。

34
This is the study of the body, right?
这是对身体的研究，对吗？

35
That's right.

36
So, maybe in high school you took an anatomy class.
所以，也许在高中你上过解剖课。

37
You studied the bodies maybe of animals, for example.
你可能研究过动物的身体，例如。

38
That's right.
没错。

39
But if we're talking about human beings, we would call it human anatomy.
但如果我们谈论人类，我们会称之为人类解剖学。

40
And we would study the things like your organs, your bones, all the things that make up your body.
我们会研究你的器官、骨骼，以及构成你身体的所有东西。

41
That's right.
没错。

42
And that's our next word.
这就是我们的下一个词。

43
We're talking about our body organs.
我们在谈论我们的身体器官。

44
Now, this is important.
现在，这很重要。

45
Where are these located, Marco?
这些器官在哪里，马尔科？

46
Inside or outside?

49
So, the body has many different organs.
所以，身体有许多不同的器官。

50
And we learned all about these in today's dialogue.
我们在今天的对话中学到了这些。

51
But an organ is basically a part.
但器官基本上是一个部分。

52
A part of your body.
你身体的一部分。

53
But it has a special function, or many functions.
但它有一个特殊的功能，或者多个功能。

54
Yeah, that's right.
是的，没错。

55
So, for example, we talked about the heart.
例如，我们谈到了心脏。

56
We all know what the heart is.
我们都知道心脏是什么。

57
And it's one of our main organs that pumps blood through our body.
它是我们主要的器官之一，负责将血液泵送到全身。

58
That's right.
没错。

59
And so, some of these organs have to do with processing food.
所以，这些器官中的一些与食物处理有关。

60
Some have to do with blood.
有些与血液有关。

61
But there's also an interesting system that we heard about called the central nervous system.
但还有一个有趣的系统，我们听说过，叫做中枢神经系统。

62
That's right.
没错。

63
And this is very closely related to the brain.
这与大脑密切相关。

64
And so, basically, the nervous system is in charge of all the things that you feel in your body.
所以，基本上，神经系统负责你在身体中感受到的所有东西。

65
That's right.
没错。

66
So, you feel through what are called nerves.
所以，你通过被称为神经的东西来感知。

67
And the central nervous system is actually a system that connects all these things together and then connects it to the brain.
中枢神经系统实际上是一个将所有这些东西连接在一起并连接到大脑的系统。

68
So, think of a system as being comprised of many different parts, not just one nerve.
所以，想象一个系统是由许多不同的部分组成，而不仅仅是一个神经。

69
That's right.
没错。

70
So, we're talking about, for example, your skin is part of the nervous system.
所以，我们在谈论，例如，你的皮肤是神经系统的一部分。

71
Your eyes, what you see.
你的眼睛，你所看到的。

72
And all this gets fed into the brain and it processes it.
所有这些信息都传递到大脑并被处理。

73
And that's what, basically, the nervous system is all about.
这就是神经系统的基本内容。

74
That's right.
没错。

75
And the brain is also important for other things.
大脑对其他事情也很重要。

76
We heard about this noun, cognition.
我们听说过这个名词，认知。

77
Yeah, the doctor said... yeah, the teacher said that cognition was one of the other things that the brain helped us with.
是的，医生说... 是的，老师说认知是大脑帮助我们的其他事情之一。

78
So, what exactly is cognition?
那么，认知到底是什么？

79
Cognition is the ability to think.
认知是思考的能力。

80
Alright?
好吗？

81
So, humans have cognition.
所以，人类有认知。

82
That means we have brains and our brains allow us to think and even talk and write music and things like that.
这意味着我们有大脑，而我们的脑允许我们思考，甚至说话、写音乐等等。

83
But, for example, a rock does not have cognition.
但例如，岩石没有认知。

84
Right.
对。

85
A plant would not have cognition either because they don't have this special organ, the brain, that allows them to think.
植物也没有认知，因为它们没有这个特殊的器官，大脑，允许它们思考。

86
Right.
对。

87
So, it's a noun, right?
所以，这是一个名词，对吗？

88
You're saying that we have cognition because we have brains.
你在说我们有认知是因为我们有大脑。

89
That's right.
没错。

90
You have it.
你有它。

91
Okay.
好的。

92
So, those are the four words that we're going to take a look at to introduce the lesson.
所以，这就是我们要介绍的四个词。

93
Why don't we move on now to more specific vocab.
我们现在为什么不继续看更具体的词汇呢？

94
Let's take a look at some of the main organs that we discussed in this dialogue on Language Takeaway Part 2.
让我们看看在语言收获第二部分中讨论的一些主要器官。

95
Okay, class.

96
So, today we're going to continue with our anatomy class.
所以，今天我们将继续我们的解剖课。

97
Today we will review everything we have learned.
今天我们将复习我们所学的一切。

98
Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is?
有人能告诉我第一个主要器官是什么吗？

99
The brain.
大脑。

100
That's right.
没错。

101
The brain.
大脑。

102
It serves as a control center for the body, handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition.
它作为身体的控制中心，处理中枢神经系统的过程以及认知。

103
Then what major organ is in our chest?
那么我们胸部的主要器官是什么？

104
The heart.
心脏。

105
Very good.
非常好。

106
It pumps blood throughout the body using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins.
它通过循环系统如血管和静脉将血液泵送到全身。

107
Now, let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive.
现在，我们不要忘记我们的肺为心脏和身体提供氧气以维持生命。

108
Now, what about the organs that help us digest food?
现在，帮助我们消化食物的器官呢？

109
The stomach and intestines.
胃和肠。

110
Very good.
非常好。

111
Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process the food and then expel the waste.
我们不要忘记胃是分解食物的，而肠道处理食物并排出废物。

112
Are we forgetting anything?
我们还忘记了什么吗？

113
Yeah.
是的。

114
Our kidneys, liver and bladder.
我们的肾脏、肝脏和膀胱。

115
Oh, yes.
哦，是的。

116
You are right.
你说得对。

117
Very important organs indeed.
确实是非常重要的器官。

118
So, what do these organs do, teacher?

120
Time for a break.
该休息了。

121
We can talk about it when you get back.
你回来后我们可以再谈。

122
So, we're moving down the body.
所以，我们继续往下讲。

123
We had the brain and we mentioned the stomach.
我们提到了大脑和胃。

124
We had the brain and then the heart, of course, which pumps blood like you say, Marco.
我们有大脑，然后是心脏，当然，心脏像你说的，马尔科，泵送血液。

125
But the next item, the next organ, is the stomach.
但下一个器官是胃。

126
That's right.
没错。

127
So, we get to the stomach and the intestines, which are very closely bound together.
所以，我们到了胃和肠，它们是紧密相连的。

128
So, what does the stomach do first?
那么，胃首先做什么？

129
First of all, when you eat food, the food is sent to your stomach where your stomach breaks it down and decides what parts to keep and what parts to save, right?
首先，当你吃食物时，食物被送到你的胃，胃分解它并决定保留哪些部分，保存哪些部分，对吗？

130
Right.
对。

131
And the interesting thing is that in our stomachs, we have what we call acid.
有趣的是，在我们的胃里，我们有我们所称的酸。

132
Yeah.
是的。

133
So, these acids break down those foods because it all gets mixed together in there and your body has to determine what exactly you've been eating.
这些酸分解食物，因为它们在里面混合在一起，你的身体必须确定你到底吃了什么。

134
Right.
对。

135
Exactly.
正是如此。

136
So, after the stomach breaks things down, it goes through the intestines.
所以，胃分解东西后，它会通过肠道。

137
And also, the intestines are very important and they're very long, but they're all wound up inside our stomach.
而且，肠道也非常重要，而且它们非常长，但它们都缠绕在我们的胃里。

138
That's right.
没错。

139
They kind of look like a lot of S's because they're all coiled up inside of us and they're indeed quite long.
它们看起来像很多S，因为它们都卷曲在我们体内，确实相当长。

140
But the intestines are also very, very important because they're actually what the waste or the parts of food that our bodies don't need, so they travel through to get out of our systems.
但肠道也非常重要，因为它们实际上是我们身体不需要的废物或食物部分，所以它们会通过以便排出体外。

141
That's right.
没错。

142
So, actually, the intestines will absorb part of the proteins and the vitamins and everything that we need.
所以，实际上，肠道会吸收我们所需的部分蛋白质和维生素等。

143
And at the same time, they will also act as little tunnels that will transport the waste, the things that we don't need to have inside our body to later be able to digest.
同时，它们也会作为小通道，运输废物，即我们不需要留在体内的东西，以便后续消化。

144
That's right.
没错。

145
So, the stomach and the intestines, those have to do with the way that we eat, process, and dispose of food.
所以，胃和肠与我们如何吃、处理和处理食物有关。

146
But now we have the kidneys, okay?
但现在我们有肾脏，好吗？

147
So people have two kidneys, right?
所以人有两个肾脏，对吗？

148
Yeah, that's right.
是的，没错。

149
People have two kidneys and actually you can continue living with just one kidney, right?
人有两个肾脏，实际上你可以只用一个肾脏继续生活，对吗？

150
That's right.
没错。

151
They're kind of shaped like a C, almost.
它们的形状有点像C，几乎。

152
In fact, we have something called a kidney bean in English, which is a red bean and it looks just like a kidney.
事实上，我们有一种叫做肾豆的东西，它是一种红豆，看起来就像肾脏。

153
Okay.
好的。

154
And, well, what do the kidneys do?
那么，肾脏的作用是什么？

155
The kidneys, from what I understand, basically clean your blood.
根据我的理解，肾脏基本上是清洁你的血液。

156
So, you know, there's lots of things in your system, in your body, especially from the things that you eat and maybe the chemicals that you're exposed to.
所以，你知道，你的身体里有很多东西，尤其是你吃的东西和你接触的化学物质。

157
And we need our kidneys, or at least the one kidney, to clean our blood and make sure our blood is what it's supposed to be.
我们需要肾脏，或者至少一个肾脏，来清洁我们的血液，确保我们的血液是它应该是的。

158
And in fact, when the kidneys aren't working properly, it's very, very serious.
事实上，当肾脏工作不正常时，情况非常严重。

159
And we call this kidney failure, right?
我们称之为肾衰竭，对吗？

160
So when you're watching a TV show about doctors, maybe you say, Oh, he's gone into kidney failure.
所以当你在看关于医生的电视节目时，可能会说，哦，他进入了肾衰竭。

161
It's a big deal.
这是个大事。

162
Very big problem.
非常大的问题。

163
All right, so this is what our kidneys do.
好吧，这就是我们的肾脏的作用。

164
A very important part of our bodies, obviously.
显然是我们身体中非常重要的一部分。

165
And, well, as you said, they act as filters.
嗯，正如你所说，它们充当过滤器。

166
But near the kidneys, we also have the liver.
但在肾脏附近，我们还有肝脏。

167
That's right.
没错。

168
Liver is actually, for some people, a delicious food.
对于某些人来说，肝脏实际上是一种美味的食物。

169
Not human liver, but animal liver.
不是人类的肝脏，而是动物的肝脏。

170
But in humans, we also have this organ, right?
但在人类中，我们也有这个器官，对吗？

171
And it's also closely related to people who have drinking problems.
而且它与有饮酒问题的人密切相关。

172
They have bad livers.
他们的肝脏不好。

173
And why is that?
为什么呢？

174
I think it has to do a little bit with what the liver does.
我认为这与肝脏的功能有关。

175
It does many different things.
它有很多不同的功能。

176
But alcohol, I think, harms your liver.
但我认为，酒精会伤害你的肝脏。

177
It makes it weaker.
它使其变得更弱。

178
And the liver is important because it helps to generate hormones.
肝脏很重要，因为它帮助生成激素。

179
But it also helps us process chemicals in our body.
但它也帮助我们处理体内的化学物质。

180
Right.
对。

181
Yeah, so this is really important.
是的，所以这真的很重要。

182
Actually, why the liver is so important is because it does so much.
实际上，肝脏之所以如此重要，是因为它做了很多事情。

183
And we only got one of them, so we can't really live without it, right?
而且我们只有一个，所以我们不能没有它生活，对吗？

184
That's right.
没错。

185
So the liver is a very important thing.
所以肝脏是非常重要的东西。

186
And actually, many people now have gone through liver transplants.
实际上，许多人现在都经历了肝脏移植。

187
That means that their liver stops working, so they receive the liver of another person.
这意味着他们的肝脏停止工作，所以他们接受了另一个人的肝脏。

188
Right.
对。

189
Yeah, so you might hear that as well on TV.
是的，所以你可能在电视上也会听到这个。

190
And the last organ that we took a look at here is the bladder, which is also very important, goes hand in hand with the kidneys.
我们这里看到的最后一个器官是膀胱，它也非常重要，与肾脏密切相关。

191
It does, it does.
确实如此。

192
So the bladder, you might hear someone say, I have a bad bladder.
所以你可能会听到有人说，我的膀胱不好。

193
That means that I often have to use the bathroom to go urinate.
这意味着我经常需要上厕所排尿。

194
Now the bladder is where liquids and also some kinds of chemicals in our bodies that we get from the food that we eat are kept until we dispose of them.
现在，膀胱是我们体内液体和一些化学物质的储存处，直到我们排出它们。

195
Right, right, exactly.
对，没错，确实如此。

196
So actually when your bladder is full, because it gets full of liquid or urine, that's when you have to go to the bathroom.
所以实际上当你的膀胱满了，因为它充满了液体或尿液，这时你就需要上厕所。

197
That's right, and so pregnant women often have weaker bladders.
没错，所以孕妇的膀胱通常比较弱。

198
They feel pressure on the bladder, so it hurts and it doesn't hurt.
她们感到膀胱有压力，所以会感到疼痛，也不会疼。

199
It pushes down the bladder, the baby does.
宝宝会压迫膀胱。

200
So they often have to pee very often, unlike people who are not pregnant.
所以她们经常需要上厕所，不像没有怀孕的人。

201
Okay, very interesting.
好的，非常有趣。

202
And actually some people say that I have a small bladder and that's why they go to the bathroom all the time, more often than others.
其实有些人说我有小膀胱，这就是为什么他们总是上厕所，比其他人更频繁。

203
Now why don't we take a look at our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back in a bit to talk a little bit more.
现在我们最后再看看我们的对话，稍后我们会回来再聊一聊。

204
Okay class, so today we're going to continue with our anatomy class.
好的，班级，今天我们将继续我们的解剖学课。

205
Today we will review everything we have learned.
今天我们将复习我们所学的一切。

206
Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is?
有人能告诉我第一个主要器官是什么吗？

207
The brain.

208
That's right, the brain.
没错，大脑。

209

Very good.
非常好。

213
It pumps blood throughout the body using the circulatory system, such as blood vessels and veins.

214
Now, let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive.
现在，让我们不要忘记我们的肺为我们的心脏和身体提供氧气，以维持生命。

215

好吧，你提到其实有些人会进行肝脏移植。

228
So, out of all these organs, we could also have a kidney transplant, right?
所以，在所有这些器官中，我们也可以进行肾脏移植，对吗？

229
You can donate your kidneys.
你可以捐赠你的肾脏。

230
You can, you can.
你可以，没错。

231
So, obviously you can't have any kidney.

232
You actually have to have a match.
你实际上必须有匹配的。

233
You know, someone who is the right type.
你知道，有人是合适的类型。

234
But often times they do perform these surgeries with a kidney transplant or a liver transplant.

那么，心脏移植呢？

236
I believe they've done tests of heart transplants.
我相信他们已经进行了心脏移植的测试。

237
And they've done a few successful ones.
他们已经成功进行了几次。

238
Sometimes they use pieces of cow or pig hearts.
有时他们会使用牛或猪的心脏部件。

239
Because they have very similar genetic make-ups to human beings.
因为它们与人类的基因组成非常相似。

240
So they can use little pieces like valves.
所以他们可以使用小部件，比如瓣膜。

241
But I really don't know.
但我真的不知道。

242
I don't think they're as common as liver or kidney.
我认为它们没有肝脏或肾脏那么常见。

243
That's right.
没错。

244
And actually these organs, you know, we don't really pay too much attention to them.
其实这些器官，你知道，我们并没有太多关注它们。

245
But they're so very delicate and they do so many things.
但它们非常脆弱，做着很多事情。

246
That actually once you only begin having some problems with them.

So it's really important to understand a little bit about how they work.
所以了解它们的工作原理是非常重要的。

250
And also how to take care of them.
以及如何照顾它们。

251
Because obviously if you're having liver problems, you should stop drinking so much.
因为显然如果你有肝脏问题，你应该少喝酒。

252
That, you know, there are some things that you can do to help protect yourself.
你知道，有一些事情可以帮助保护自己。

253
And one that we didn't mention is actually the biggest organ that they talk about is the skin.

Well, I wasn't very good at anatomy or biology.
嗯，我在解剖学或生物学方面并不好。

262
I wasn't really into it much.
我并不是很感兴趣。

263
But I didn't realize that the skin is actually an organ.
但我没有意识到皮肤实际上是一个器官。

264
Just like, you know, the heart, the lungs, everything.
就像你知道的，心脏、肺，所有的一切。

265
Interesting.
有趣。

266
I hadn't thought about that.
我没有想到这一点。

267
It's maybe because I feel so comfortable in it.
也许是因为我在里面感到如此舒适。

268
I just get to see it every day.
我每天都能看到它。
