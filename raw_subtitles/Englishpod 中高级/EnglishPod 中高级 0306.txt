Today we are talking about a very interesting topic, most importantly among men, who are trying to get women's attention.
今天我们要讨论一个非常有趣的话题，尤其是关于男性，如何吸引女性的注意。

5
Okay, so these are some of the things that men might try to say if they are trying to find a girlfriend, or men, if you're out there, things that you might want to say, or not want to say in English.
好吧，这些是男性在寻找女朋友时可能会说的一些话，或者男性们，如果你们在这里，可能想说的，或者不想说的英语。

6
Right, that's right.
对，没错。

7
So why don't we just take a look at our dialogue, let's see what's going on, and we'll be back in a bit.
那我们来看看我们的对话，看看发生了什么，我们稍后再回来。

8
Let's go out tomorrow night.
明天晚上我们出去吧。

9
We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend.
我们可以去酒吧，试着帮你找个女朋友。

10
I don't think that's a good idea.
我觉得这主意不好。

11
I'm just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation.
我不擅长接近别人并开始对话。

12
Maybe you just need a few pick-up lines, you know, to break the ice.
也许你只需要几个搭讪的台词，知道吗，来打破僵局。

13
Pick-up lines don't work.
搭讪台词没用。

14
Come on, you can just walk up to a girl and say, if you were a booger, I'd pick you first.
来吧，你可以走到一个女孩面前说，如果你是个鼻屎，我会先挑你。

15
What?
什么？

16
Come on, that's just lame.
来吧，这太无聊了。

17
No girl would fall for that.
没有女孩会被这个吸引。

18
Fine, then you can say, so there you are, I've been looking all over for you, the woman of my dreams.
好吧，那你可以说，嘿，你在这儿，我到处在找你，我梦中的女人。

19
That's a good one.
这个不错。

20
I think that's pretty funny.
我觉得这很有趣。

21
Yeah, so you make her laugh, you make a fool of yourself a little bit, and then you buy her a drink.
是啊，你让她笑，让自己有点傻，然后请她喝一杯。

22
Okay, how does this sound?
好吧，这听起来怎么样？

23
I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there.
我被你的美丽迷住了，以至于撞上了那面墙。

24
So I'm going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.
所以我需要你的名字和号码以备保险之用。

25
Nice, let's go.
不错，走吧。

26
Alright, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

27
So now let's explain what's going on a little bit more.
现在让我们更详细地解释一下发生了什么。

28
Let's take a look at some vocab on language takeaway.
让我们看看一些语言要点。

29
Language takeaway So the first word that we have here, Marco, is a verb, we say to approach, or to approach someone.
语言要点 第一个词是动词，我们说接近，或者接近某人。

30
That's right, to approach someone, and that means to, you know, go up to someone and start a conversation, start talking to them.
没错，接近某人，意思是走到某人面前并开始对话。

31
That's right, so you physically walk towards someone, you go to them to start talking to them.
没错，所以你是指身体上走向某人，去找他们开始交谈。

32
So you can say, I'm not good at approaching other people, or he approached her in the bar because he wanted to talk to her.
所以你可以说，我不擅长接近别人，或者他在酒吧接近她，因为他想和她说话。

33
That's right.
没错。

34
So to approach someone is to go up or get close to that person and start talking to them.
所以接近某人就是走近或靠近那个人并开始和他们交谈。

35
That's right.
没错。

36
Alright, so now what the dialogue focuses on is pickup lines, as the title says.
好的，现在对话的重点是搭讪台词，正如标题所说。

37
So what exactly are pickup lines?
那么搭讪台词到底是什么？

38
Alright, well I'll take this as a phrase, you don't want to look at the individual words, but pickup lines are things that people say to show that they are interested romantically in other people.
好吧，我把这当作一个短语，你不想看单个单词，但搭讪台词是人们用来表明他们对其他人有浪漫兴趣的东西。

39
So if I am talking to someone and maybe he says something that is a pickup line, he's trying to show that he's interested in me.
所以如果我在和某人交谈，也许他说了一句搭讪台词，他是在试图表明他对我感兴趣。

40
That's right.
没错。

41
So usually I guess guys use pickup lines at bars or something to get a girl's attention and to, as you say, show that he is interested in her, right?
所以通常我想男孩们在酒吧或其他地方使用搭讪台词来吸引女孩的注意，并且，正如你所说，表明他对她感兴趣，对吧？

42
That's right, and some are very creative and nice, and some are very stupid and silly.
没错，有些非常有创意和不错，有些则非常愚蠢和傻。

43
So there are many different kinds of pickup lines, but the trick here is that they're usually lines that the person will create or will have heard before they use it.
所以有很多不同种类的搭讪台词，但这里的诀窍是，它们通常是人们在使用之前创造的或听过的台词。

44
Right, exactly.
对，正是如此。

45
It's like a fixed thing.
就像是一个固定的东西。

46
Yeah, it is usually very creative, as you say, or very funny to kind of get the girl's attention.
是的，通常非常有创意，正如你所说，或者非常搞笑，以吸引女孩的注意。

47
Now, the first pickup line that we heard was, if you were a booger, I'd pick you first.
现在，我们听到的第一个搭讪台词是，如果你是个鼻屎，我会先挑你。

48
If you were a booger, I'd pick you first.
如果你是个鼻屎，我会先挑你。

49
Alright, so what does he mean here?
好吧，他在这里是什么意思？

50
If you were a booger, what is a booger?
如果你是个鼻屎，鼻屎是什么？

51
A booger is a piece of dirt in your nose.
鼻屎是你鼻子里的脏东西。

52
Okay, so sometimes you have some things in your nose and you want to blow your nose to clear it.
好吧，有时你鼻子里有东西，你想擤鼻涕来清理它。

53
Well, those things inside your nose, those are called boogers.
嗯，鼻子里的那些东西叫做鼻屎。

54
This is very informal English.
这是非常非正式的英语。

55
Right, so I guess the technical term for it would be mucus.
对，所以我想它的技术术语是粘液。

56
Mucus, that's right.
粘液，没错。

57
But obviously, in English, there's also an informal way of calling it, and it's called a booger.
但显然，在英语中，还有一种非正式的叫法，就是鼻屎。

58
So the idea here is the pickup line means two things.
所以这里的搭讪台词有两个意思。

59
It means sometimes you have to take boogers out of your nose.
意思是有时你需要把鼻屎从鼻子里拿出来。

60
Some people use their finger.
有些人用手指。

61
But the other meaning is, you know, if I'm interested in you, I pick you first.
但另一个意思是，如果我对你感兴趣，我会先挑你。

62
Right, and the verb here, to pick, is not to choose, but is actually used as a verb when you're talking about your nose.
对，动词pick在这里不是选择，而是指在谈论鼻子时使用的动词。

63
You pick your nose or you pick a booger.
你挖鼻子或挑鼻屎。

64
That means to actually remove.
这意味着实际去除。

65
It means to put your finger in your nose to take out these pieces of dirt.
意思是用手指放进鼻子里拿出这些脏东西。

66
Right, so maybe a mom, a mother, to their younger son or daughter would tell them, don't pick your nose in public.
对，所以也许一个妈妈会告诉她的小儿子或女儿，不要在公共场合挖鼻子。

67
Moms often say this in English.
妈妈们在英语中常常这样说。

68
Don't pick your nose.
不要挖鼻子。

69
It's rude.
这很粗鲁。

70
Exactly.
正是如此。

71
All right, so it's a very interesting pickup line, obviously very funny and I guess creative, but at the same time, the verb there, to pick, we just figured out it means something completely different.
好吧，这显然是一个非常有趣的搭讪台词，当然非常搞笑，我想也很有创意，但同时，动词pick，我们刚刚发现它意味着完全不同的东西。

72
All right, so it's a joke, but it's also kind of gross.
好吧，所以这是一个笑话，但也有点恶心。

73
Exactly, and obviously his friend agrees and says, that's lame.
正是如此，显然他的朋友同意并说，这太无聊了。

74
Lame, so something is lame if it's stupid or not funny.
无聊，所以如果某事很无聊，那就是愚蠢或不好笑。

75
We often say, that's a really lame joke, which means, I don't like that.
我们常常说，那真是个无聊的笑话，这意味着，我不喜欢这个。

76
I don't think it's funny.
我觉得不好笑。

77
Okay, and actually people start using the word lame for many things that they don't like or they think is not interesting, right?
好吧，实际上人们开始用无聊这个词来形容他们不喜欢或认为不有趣的许多事情，对吧？

78
Yeah, like that band is so lame.
是的，比如那个乐队太无聊了。

79
Or that movie was lame.
或者那部电影很无聊。

80
It wasn't interesting, it wasn't fun.
没有趣，不好玩。

81
Okay, so that's basically what it means.
好吧，这基本上就是它的意思。

82
All right, so let's take a look at everything we've learned again and we'll be back in a bit.
好吧，让我们再看看我们学到的一切，我们稍后再回来。

83
Let's go out tomorrow night.

这是我们在两个男孩谈论如何接近女孩时听到的。

108
Right, so to break the ice is to make an awkward situation or something that's a little bit uncomfortable, a little bit more relaxed.

109
That's right, so oftentimes in a new company or at a party where you don't know anyone, you have to break the ice.

126
No, no.
不，不。

127
It means you believe it or you consider it to be real.

All right, so to fall for something means to believe it or to think it's true.
