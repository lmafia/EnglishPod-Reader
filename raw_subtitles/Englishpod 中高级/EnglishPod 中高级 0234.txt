That's right.

64
And the word sore.
还有“痛”的意思。

65
Sore means it hurts.

66
So I could have a sore back or sore knees.
所以我可以有背痛或膝盖痛。

67
Sore is basically an adjective that describes pain.
痛基本上是一个形容词，描述疼痛。

68
Pain.
疼痛。

So you have an ache in your throat.

她说她有喉咙痛，医生说，啊，我明白了。

72
Yes, you do sound rather croaky.
是的，你的声音听起来很沙哑。

73
Okay, croaky is a way to describe the way a person sounds, especially when they're talking and maybe their voice I think is very deep or rough.
好吧，沙哑是描述一个人声音的方式，尤其是当他们说话时，可能他们的声音听起来很低沉或粗糙。

74

75
So usually if you have a sore throat or a very bad cough, you sound a little bit croaky.

所以是的，有时当你喉咙痛或咳嗽很厉害时，人们会说你喉咙里有青蛙，对吧？

83
Alright, so that's the word croaky.
好吧，这就是沙哑这个词。

84
Now, moving on, if you have a sore throat, it's usually because your tonsils are swollen.
现在，继续，如果你有喉咙痛，通常是因为你的扁桃体肿胀。

85

91
I think they pick up some... I don't know what they do.

92
I don't think you need them, actually, because a lot of people have them taken out when they're young.
我觉得其实你不需要它们，因为很多人年轻时就把它们切除了。

93
But tonsils, when they are infected or when they are swollen, are very, very painful.

98
So if they are swollen, that means they are big.
所以如果它们肿胀，意味着它们变大了。

99
That's right.

100
So swollen means they're bigger than normal.
所以肿胀意味着它们比正常大。

101
And you can say this about many different things.
你可以用这个来形容很多不同的东西。

102
For example, maybe someone stepped on my toe, and my toe really hurts, and I looked down, and it's swollen.
例如，也许有人踩到了我的脚趾，我的脚趾真的很痛，我低头一看，它肿了。

103
That means my toe got bigger.

And the doctor also recommended her to rest because she is highly contagious.
医生还建议她休息，因为她非常具有传染性。

好的，所以你要远离那些有传染性的人。

125

So Chloe goes in to see her doctor, Dr. Evans, and she says, Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
所以Chloe去看她的医生Evans医生，她说，感谢你在这么短的时间内见我。

187
What's short notice?

190
Great.

192
That's pretty short notice.

194
You can say this also when you're talking to friends.

你知道，我真的很抱歉在这么短的时间内取消，但我今晚不能去吃晚餐。

On short notice.
突然通知。

200
On such short notice.

201
That's right.
没错。

202
Alright, so moving on to her second phrase, Chloe was explaining that she doesn't feel very well, and she said, I think I'm coming down with the flu.
好的，接下来是她的第二句话，克洛伊解释说她感觉不太好，她说，我觉得我快感冒了。

203
Okay, so let's look at this verbal phrase here, coming down with.
好的，我们来看一下这个动词短语，coming down with。

204
Okay, so you can come down with many different illnesses, but the verb here means, this is the beginning of my illness.
好的，你可以得很多不同的病，但这里的动词意思是，这就是我生病的开始。

205
So I'm starting to feel the effects, like you said, Marco.
所以我开始感受到影响，就像你说的，马尔科。

206
I'm feeling some symptoms.
我感觉到一些症状。

207
So I'm starting to get sick, right?
所以我开始生病，对吧？

208
I'm coming down with a fever.
我快发烧了。

209
Or I think I'm coming down with a cold.
或者我觉得我快感冒了。

210
Very common.
非常常见。

211
And the doctor started to check Chloe, how she was breathing, and I think he listened to her lungs with his stethoscope.
医生开始检查克洛伊的呼吸，我想他用听诊器听了她的肺。

212
Stethoscope.
听诊器。

213
And he said, wow, you are really all bunged up.
他还说，哇，你真的很堵。

214
Alright, so here he's basically saying that she's very congested.
好的，所以他基本上是在说她非常拥堵。

215
That means that her breathing passageways, like in her nose and her throat and her chest, are very stuffy.
这意味着她的呼吸道，比如鼻子、喉咙和胸部，非常堵塞。

216
There's things in them, usually mucus and phlegm.
里面有东西，通常是粘液和痰。

217
These are things that, you know what's in your nose when you have a cold and you have to blow it out?
这些就是你感冒时鼻子里有什么，你必须把它吹出来的东西。

218
That's phlegm and mucus.
那就是痰和粘液。

219
Yeah, not a very pretty thing.
是的，不是很美好的东西。

220
No, very disgusting, actually.
不，实际上非常恶心。

221
So maybe we should move on to our next item.
所以也许我们应该继续下一个项目。

222
Alright, so she's all bunged up and... Clear up.
好的，所以她完全堵塞了……清理。

223
And so he recommended a couple of different medicines, such as antibiotics, some pills, and he also gave her an inhaler to clear up her lungs.
所以他推荐了几种不同的药物，比如抗生素，一些药丸，他还给了她一个吸入器来清理她的肺。

224
Okay, so an inhaler is basically a device that you use to put steroids in your lungs that will help you breathe.
好的，吸入器基本上是一个设备，你用它把类固醇放入肺部，帮助你呼吸。

225
So some people, when they're running or they're walking, they're very short of breath and they can't breathe.
所以有些人，当他们跑步或走路时，呼吸急促，无法呼吸。

226
Well, there's a problem with this, like asthma, and they need to breathe this little inhaler.
嗯，这有问题，比如哮喘，他们需要用这个小吸入器来呼吸。

227
It's like a little tube.
它就像一个小管子。

228
I think you inhale medicine from this little tube.
我想你是从这个小管子里吸入药物。

229
Yeah, so the medicine helps open up your passageways, it helps you breathe, and it's very important for some people.
是的，所以药物帮助打开你的通道，帮助你呼吸，对某些人来说非常重要。

230
But in the case of an illness, like your lungs are very congested, this helps you breathe on the short term.
但在生病的情况下，比如你的肺非常拥堵，这在短期内帮助你呼吸。

231
Right, so basically clear up is to allow air or the movement of something within your body, usually, I think.
对，所以基本上清理是让空气或某种东西在你体内移动，通常，我认为。

232
Right, but to clear up isn't necessarily about air, it's basically a way to say that it will make this problem go away.
对，但清理不一定是关于空气，它基本上是说这将使这个问题消失。

233
To clear something up is to make the problem go.
清理某事就是让问题消失。

234
Right, so I guess if you get medicine from a doctor, he'll say, okay, this will help you clear up your throat.
对，所以我想如果你从医生那里拿到药，他会说，好吧，这将帮助你清理喉咙。

235
Right, or if you have a problem with acne, maybe your doctor will give you some cream to help clear up your acne, make it go away.
对，或者如果你有痤疮问题，也许你的医生会给你一些药膏来帮助清理你的痤疮，让它消失。

236
Clear up your skin.
清理你的皮肤。

237
Okay, so a lot of great examples there.
好的，所以这里有很多很好的例子。

238
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue one last time.
我们为什么不回去再听一遍对话。

Alright, so talking about illnesses and being contagious, we mentioned this pink eye illness before.
好的，谈到疾病和传染性，我们之前提到过这种粉红眼病。

284
So this is the colloquial way of saying conjunctivitis, which is... I don't know if anyone has ever gotten it.
这就是结膜炎的口语说法，我不知道是否有人得过。

285
Your eye gets very, very red for a prolonged period of time.
你的眼睛会在很长一段时间内变得非常红。

286
That's right, and it itches a lot.
没错，而且会非常痒。

287
It itches.
会痒。

288
And so already your eye is very red or very pink, like the name says, but you really want to scratch it and itch it, and it's really hard not to.
所以你的眼睛已经非常红或非常粉红，正如名字所说，但你真的想去抓它，想去挠，很难不去。

289
Yeah, and I think you treat it by means of some eye drops.
是的，我想你是通过一些眼药水来治疗它。

290
Yeah, and you have to wait.

291
I actually had a very bad case of pink eye once that I couldn't just clear up with drops, but the doctor gave me some eye drops.
我曾经有过一次非常严重的粉红眼，不能仅靠眼药水治愈，但医生给我开了一些眼药水。

292
They were so strong that I put them in my eye and I can taste them.
它们太强了，我滴到眼里，能尝到它们的味道。

293
So apparently it's very strange.
所以显然这很奇怪。

294
And it wouldn't clear up, so then I had to get some kind of like a clear gel put in my eye and my eye patched up for like two days.
而且它没有好转，所以我不得不在眼里放一种透明的凝胶，并且眼睛贴了两天。

296
It was crazy.

297
Well, I've never had it, but I know that it's very, very contagious, like we were saying earlier.
嗯，我从来没有得过，但我知道这非常非常具有传染性，就像我们之前说的。

298
And so if a student at a school gets pink eye, all the parents get very nervous because it's very, very likely that he or she will give it to another person.
所以如果学校里有学生得了粉红眼，所有家长都会非常紧张，因为他或她很可能会传染给其他人。

299
Because, you know, kids, if you touch your eye and you touch someone else, all of a sudden they have this disease.
因为你知道，孩子们，如果你碰了自己的眼睛又碰了别人，突然他们就得了这种病。

300

So yeah, it's a very common thing.
