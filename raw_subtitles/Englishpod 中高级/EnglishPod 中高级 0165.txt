Hello, English learners, and welcome back to EnglishPod.
你好，英语学习者，欢迎回到EnglishPod。

2
My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

3
And my name is Katherine.
我叫Katherine。

4
And today we're talking about money, but this time we're talking about borrowing money.
今天我们要谈论钱，但这次我们要谈论借钱。

5
Right, so we're asking for money.
对，所以我们在请求钱。

6
We're going to the bank and we are asking for a loan.
我们去银行申请贷款。

7
But before we go, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.
但在我们去之前，为什么不先看看词汇预览呢？

8
Vocabulary preview.
词汇预览。

9
Okay, so a loan is some money that you get from the bank, so we're talking about requesting a loan today.
好的，贷款是你从银行获得的一些钱，所以今天我们在谈论申请贷款。

10
Alright, so you request for a loan or you ask for a loan.
好吧，你申请贷款或请求贷款。

11
Exactly, so to request is to ask.
正是如此，请求就是询问。

12
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

13
And that's the word that we have for vocabulary preview, so let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.
这就是我们在词汇预览中提到的单词，所以让我们第一次听对话。

14
Hello, sir, may I help you?
你好，先生，我能帮你吗？

15
Yes, I would like some information for requesting a loan.
是的，我想要一些关于申请贷款的信息。

16
Very well.
非常好。

17
Here are the general terms of our loan policies.
这是我们贷款政策的一般条款。

18
We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans.
我们以拥有全国最低的个人贷款利率而自豪。

19
I see.
我明白了。

20
So let me get this straight.
所以让我弄清楚。

21
If I borrow, let's say, $10,000, how much will I have to pay each month?
如果我借，比如说，$10,000，我每个月需要支付多少？

22
It depends on how long you take to pay it back.
这取决于你还款的时间。

23
If we lend you $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 10% for 48 months, you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan, which is called the principal, and another small portion of the annual interest rate.
如果我们以10%的年利率借给你$10,000，期限为48个月，你每个月需要支付一部分贷款，称为本金，以及另一小部分年利率。

24
This, of course, is considering that you don't default on a payment.
当然，这是考虑到你没有违约的情况下。

25
It sounds good, but there's just one problem.
听起来不错，但只有一个问题。

26
I have a terrible credit score.
我的信用评分很糟糕。

27
That is a very serious problem, you see.
这是一个非常严重的问题，你看。

28
The bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets, and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan.
银行必须评估你的个人信息、过去的贷款、资产以及其他相关信息，如你的信用评分，以批准你的贷款。

29
You know what?
你知道吗？

30
I don't really need the money.
我其实并不需要这笔钱。

31
Thanks anyways.
不管怎样，谢谢。

32
All right, we're back.
好吧，我们回来了。

33
So now why don't we take a look at some of the key words that we'll find in Language Takeaway.
现在我们来看看在语言收获中会遇到的一些关键词。

34
Language Takeaway All right, so in Language Takeaway today, we have a couple of different words.
语言收获 好吧，今天在语言收获中，我们有几个不同的单词。

35
Why don't we start off with the loan policies?
我们先从贷款政策开始吧？

36
Okay, so a policy is like a rule.
好的，政策就像是规则。

37
For example, a government can have policies, but in this case, a loan policy is the rules regarding the loan that you have.
例如，政府可以有政策，但在这种情况下，贷款政策是关于你所拥有的贷款的规则。

38
Right, so maybe the loan policies could include how long, what's the maximum length of your loan, or maybe what's the annual interest rate, etc.
对，所以贷款政策可能包括贷款的最长时间，或者年利率等。

39
How much you have to pay each month, like that.
每个月你需要支付多少，就像这样。

40
So loan policy is the rules related to the loan that you've taken out.
所以贷款政策是与你所借贷款相关的规则。

41
And we have some very, very important words following this, and they go together.
接下来我们有一些非常重要的单词，它们是一起的。

42
So the first word is to borrow.
第一个单词是借。

43
Okay, so you probably know this word already, to borrow.
好的，你可能已经知道这个词，借。

44
So can I borrow your pen?
我可以借你的笔吗？

45
Can I borrow some money?
我可以借一些钱吗？

46
Sure, let me give you my pen, let me give you my money.
当然，让我给你我的笔，让我给你我的钱。

47
But wait, giving is different because giving means I don't have to get it back.
但等一下，给予是不同的，因为给予意味着我不需要把它还回来。

48
Right, so if you want to give it to someone temporarily, then you lend them your pen, or you lend them some money.
对，所以如果你想暂时给某人，那么你借给他们你的笔，或者借给他们一些钱。

49
Great, so to borrow is to take something from someone, knowing that you will have to give it back later.
很好，所以借是从某人那里拿走东西，知道你必须稍后还回去。

50
And to lend is to give it to someone, right?
而借出是给某人，对吧？

51
So can you lend me your pen?
所以你能借我你的笔吗？

52
That means can you give it to me, please?
这意味着你能把它给我吗？

53
Right, and this is a common mistake with language learners, especially English learners, that they make the mistake of using borrow instead of lend.
对，这在语言学习者中是一个常见的错误，尤其是英语学习者，他们错误地使用借而不是借出。

54
So can you borrow me some money?
所以你能借我一些钱吗？

55
Right, so can you lend me some money?
对，所以你能借我一些钱吗？

56
Sure, but I expect you to pay me back later.
当然，但我希望你稍后还我。

57
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

58
And if I pay you back later, I'll include an interest rate.
如果我稍后还你，我会包括一个利率。

59
Will you really?
你真的会吗？

60
No, not really.
不，真的不会。

61
No, not really.
不，真的不会。

62
Mostly it's banks that ask for an interest rate.
大多数情况下是银行要求利率。

63
So in this case, an interest rate means the amount of money that a bank will charge you in addition to the money that you owe them.
所以在这种情况下，利率是银行在你欠他们的钱之外收取的金额。

64
Exactly.
正是如此。

65
So it's called an interest rate, and it's a rate because it's a percentage.
所以它被称为利率，因为它是一个百分比。

66
Like 5%.
比如5%。

67
Exactly, 5-10%.
正是，5-10%。

68
That is an interest rate.
这就是利率。

69
And now moving on, if you have a loan and you have to pay each month, be careful to not default on your payments.
现在继续，如果你有贷款并且每个月都要支付，请小心不要违约。

70
Okay, default.
好的，违约。

71
In the banking world, this means to not be able to pay your loan.
在银行界，这意味着无法偿还贷款。

72
So that means that if I owe $1,000 to you, Bank of Marco, and I don't have the money, I can't pay for it, then I default.
所以这意味着如果我欠你$1,000，Marco银行，而我没有钱，我无法支付，那么我就违约了。

73
So to be late or to not make the payment.
所以迟到或不付款。

74
It's a verb, to default.
这是一个动词，违约。

75
Very good.
非常好。

76
And Will, the person asking for the loan has a small problem.
而Will，申请贷款的人有一个小问题。

77
His credit score is not very good.
他的信用评分不是很好。

78
Okay, I think he calls it terrible.
好吧，我想他称之为糟糕。

79
And one of the ways that you get a terrible credit score is by defaulting on a loan.
而获得糟糕信用评分的一个方法是违约贷款。

80
But it also means that maybe you borrow money or you have credit cards and you can't pay off your bills.
但这也意味着你借钱或有信用卡而无法偿还账单。

81
And so a credit score is very important in America and it's like a report card for your finances.
所以信用评分在美国非常重要，就像你的财务报告卡。

82
Right, so for example, if your credit score is a report card and you have an A credit score, that means that the banks won't have a problem with lending you money.
对，所以例如，如果你的信用评分是报告卡，而你有A的信用评分，这意味着银行不会有问题借给你钱。

83
Or if you want to buy a new car, it'll be okay.
或者如果你想买一辆新车，那也没问题。

84
But if you don't pay your bills on time or you default on your loans, then maybe you'll have a C or a D and then people will not really lend you money in the future.
但如果你没有按时支付账单或违约贷款，那么你可能会有C或D，然后人们将不会在未来借给你钱。

85
They won't trust you.
他们不会信任你。

86
Exactly.
正是如此。

87
Alright, so that's credit score.
好吧，这就是信用评分。

88
That's all the words we have for Fluency Builder.
这就是我们在流利构建中提到的所有单词。

89
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back shortly.
我们再听一次对话，稍后再见。

如果我们以10%的年利率借给你$10,000，期限为48个月，你每个月需要支付一部分贷款，称为本金，以及另一小部分年利率。

我其实不太需要这笔钱。

102
Thanks anyways.
不管怎样，谢谢。

103
Alright, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

104
So now why don't we take a look at three key phrases on Fluency Builder.
现在我们来看看流利构建器上的三个关键短语。

105
Let me get this straight.
让我理清一下。

106
We're going to do Fluency Builder?
我们要做流利构建器吗？

107
That's right.
没错。

108
Wait, I don't... wait.
等等，我不... 等等。

109
So, okay, this is our first phrase.
好吧，这是我们的第一个短语。

110
Let me get this straight.
让我理清一下。

111
And this is a fixed phrase that means we always say it the same way.
这是一个固定短语，意思是我们总是以相同的方式说它。

112
Wait, let me get this straight.
等等，让我理清一下。

113
We always say it the same way?
我们总是以相同的方式说吗？

114
Right, so you're asking for a confirmation or you're repeating what that person said just to be sure that it's correct.
对，所以你是在请求确认，或者你是在重复那个人所说的话，以确保它是正确的。

115
Exactly, so maybe you don't understand something or maybe you think you might have misunderstood.
正是如此，也许你不理解某些事情，或者你认为你可能误解了。

116
You say, hey, so let me get this straight and you repeat what the person just said.
你会说，嘿，让我理清一下，然后你重复那个人刚刚说的话。

117
It's a way for you to, like you say, get confirmation on what you've heard.
这是一种方式，让你确认你所听到的内容。

118
Very good.
非常好。

119
Let me get this straight.
让我理清一下。

120
And now moving on, we have the phrase pay it back.
现在继续，我们有短语“偿还”。

121
You have to pay it back.
你必须偿还。

122
Okay, and so in this case we have the verb to pay, but we also have the word back.
好的，在这种情况下，我们有动词“偿还”，但我们也有“回”的词。

123
So pay it back means to repay.
所以“偿还”意味着还款。

124
So if we take out a loan, we obviously have to pay it back to the bank.
如果我们借了贷款，显然我们必须偿还给银行。

125
Right, so you have to pay the loan back.
对，所以你必须偿还贷款。

126
Okay, so just remember that these words often go together, to pay it back.
好的，所以只要记住这些词通常是一起使用的，偿还。

127
I'll pay you back, I promise.
我会还你钱，我保证。

128

129
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

Ah, don't worry about it.
啊，别担心。

131
Alright, and the bank started off saying, we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country.
好的，银行开始时说，我们以拥有全国最低的个人贷款利率为荣。

132
Yeah, right.
是啊，没错。

133
Alright, so we pride ourselves.
好的，所以我们以此为荣。

134
What does it mean if I pride myself in something?
如果我以某种方式自豪，这意味着什么？

135
The word pride means to be really happy about something that has to do with yourself.
“自豪”这个词意味着对与自己有关的事情感到非常高兴。

136
So something that you're proud of is something that you want to tell a lot of other people about.
所以你引以为豪的事情是你想告诉很多其他人。

137
So for example, a father may say, my son just got straight A's and he's an excellent soccer player.
例如，一个父亲可能会说，我的儿子刚刚得了全A，他是一名优秀的足球运动员。

138
And so he's proud of his son.
所以他为他的儿子感到自豪。

139
But to pride oneself means to be really happy with the way that you do something.
但“以某事自豪”意味着对你做某事的方式感到非常高兴。

140
Right, so for example, if I've never smoked, right?
对，所以例如，如果我从未吸烟，对吧？

141
So I can say, I pride myself in being a non-smoker.
我可以说，我为自己是个不吸烟者而感到自豪。

142
Or I could say, I pride myself in always saving lots of money for my paycheck.
或者我可以说，我为总是为我的薪水存很多钱而感到自豪。

143
Very good.
非常好。

144
So it means I try to do this because I know it's a good thing.
所以这意味着我努力做到这一点，因为我知道这是件好事。

145
But you feel very good about this and you feel that people should be proud of you as well.
但你对此感到非常好，并且你觉得人们也应该为你感到自豪。

146
So we could ask our students here, what do you pride yourselves in as a challenge?
所以我们可以问我们的学生，你们以什么为自豪作为挑战？

147
As a challenge for the website.
作为网站的挑战。

148
Alright, so why don't we listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be back.

153
We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans.
我们以拥有全国最低的个人贷款利率为荣。

154
I see.
我明白了。

155
So let me get this straight.
所以让我理清一下。

156
If I borrow, let's say, $10,000, how much will I have to pay each month?
如果我借，假设，$10,000，我每个月需要还多少？

157
It depends on how long you take to pay it back.

If we lend you $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 10% for 48 months, you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan, which is called the principal, and another small portion of the annual interest rate.
如果我们以10%的年利率借给你$10,000，期限为48个月，你每个月需要偿还一部分贷款，称为本金，以及年利率的另一小部分。

159
This, of course, is considering that you don't default on a payment.

160
It sounds good, but there's just one problem.
听起来不错，但只有一个问题。

161
I have a terrible credit score.

162

166

Alright, very good.
好的，非常好。

168
So as you say, saving is important, and well, sometimes, do you think you need a loan?
所以正如你所说，储蓄很重要，有时，你认为你需要贷款吗？

169
I think sometimes people need loans because they want to go into business, for example.
我认为有时人们需要贷款，因为他们想创业，例如。

170
So people who want to go into small businesses or open their own companies need startup capital.
所以想要开小企业或自己的公司的人需要启动资金。

171
And so this is a really great example of when people don't have the money lying around and will go to find a bank that will give them a loan.
这真是一个很好的例子，当人们没有多余的钱时，他们会去找一家愿意给他们贷款的银行。

172
So yeah, I think it's really important, especially for the economy of a country, for business loans or small business loans to be available because sometimes it's very difficult to find a bank that will actually lend a person money to start a business.
所以是的，我认为这非常重要，尤其是对一个国家的经济来说，商业贷款或小企业贷款的可用性，因为有时很难找到一家愿意借钱给人们开公司的银行。

173
Usually they won't have a problem with lending them money to buy a new car.
通常他们在借钱给人们买新车时不会有问题。

174
But to start up a business, it's completely the opposite.
但要开办一家公司，情况完全相反。

175
It is.
确实如此。

176
And one of the really popular trends in foreign investment right now is called micro-lending.
目前外资投资中一个非常流行的趋势叫做小额贷款。

177
So micro-loans.
所以小额贷款。

178
And that means that if I want to help people in a very poor country, I can donate, I can lend $100 for someone to buy a sewing machine.
这意味着如果我想帮助一个非常贫穷的国家的人，我可以捐赠，我可以借出$100给某人买缝纫机。

179
Or for someone to buy a small computer, $500 for a small computer, and that is a micro-loan.
或者借出$500给某人买一台小电脑，这就是小额贷款。

180
It's a very, very small loan for one thing and that can help them towards their goal of being a business person.
这是一个非常非常小的贷款，可以帮助他们实现成为商人的目标。

181
Right.
对。

182
And you're not really getting money out of it, though.
但你并没有真正从中获得金钱。

183
You're not charging like 100% interest rate.
你没有收取100%的利率。

184
You're not.
你没有。

185
You're charging like 1 or 2% interest, very low interest, and you're giving people a chance to pay the money back because it's such a small amount.
你收取1%或2%的利息，非常低的利息，并且你给人们一个偿还的机会，因为金额如此之小。

186
Wow, that's really good.
哇，这真的很好。

187
A really positive thing.
一件非常积极的事情。
