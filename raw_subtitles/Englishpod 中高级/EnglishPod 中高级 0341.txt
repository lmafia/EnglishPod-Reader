Let me just put my apron on.
让我先穿上围裙。

10
Okay, so the first thing we're going to do is preheat the oven.
好的，第一件事是预热烤箱。

11
That way we have it at the desired temperature once we've finished preparing everything.
这样我们准备好一切后，烤箱就会达到所需温度。

12
Set it to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
设置为375华氏度。

13
Got it.
明白了。

14
Now we're going to make the batter.
现在我们要做面糊。

15
Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency.
取一些黄油和糖，轻轻混合，直到有良好的稠度。

16
Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing.
然后加入香草提取物和鸡蛋，继续混合。

17
Do I have to use the whisk, or can I use the electric mixer?
我需要用打蛋器吗，还是可以用电动搅拌器？

18
Go ahead and use the mixer, but put it on medium speed.
可以用搅拌器，但要调到中速。

19
I'm going to sift the flour and baking powder separately, and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients.
我会单独筛面粉和泡打粉，然后我们可以和牛奶及其他成分混合。

20
Okay, so now we need a baking pan, right?
好的，现在我们需要一个烤盘，对吗？

21
Yeah, but grease and flour at first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes.
是的，但要先涂油和撒面粉，这样蛋糕在烘烤时就不会粘在上面。

22
Done!
完成！

23
So how long do we bake it for?
那我们烤多久？

24
We can leave it in there for about 25 minutes, then we let it cool for 10 minutes before we remove the cake from the pan.

25
Wow, this is a lot easier than I thought!
哇，这比我想象的要简单得多！

26
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at some of those key words on language takeaway.
好吧，我们回来了，现在来看看一些关键的语言要点。

27
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

28
Well first of all, we have a special thing to keep our clothes clean while we are cooking.
首先，我们有一个特别的东西来保持我们在烹饪时衣服的干净。

29
What is this thing called, Marco?
这个东西叫什么，Marco？

30
This is called an apron.
这个叫围裙。

31
An apron.
围裙。

32
So it's not actually a shirt, it's a piece of fabric that you would maybe tie around your waist or around your neck to protect your clothes from flour and butter and oil.
所以它实际上不是一件衬衫，而是一块布，你可以把它系在腰间或脖子上，以保护你的衣服不被面粉、黄油和油弄脏。

33
That's right, so it's very common to wear an apron while you're cooking or maybe while you're cleaning the house or the kitchen in order to avoid getting dirty, like you say.
没错，所以在烹饪时，或者在打扫房子或厨房时，穿围裙是很常见的，以避免弄脏，正如你所说。

34
So we're going to start baking our cake and the first thing that we do is we turn on the oven in order to have it at the desired temperature.
所以我们要开始烤蛋糕，第一件事是打开烤箱，以便达到所需温度。

35
Now this is something you might see in a recipe that says the desired temperature is 450 degrees.
现在这可能在食谱中会看到，所需温度是450度。

36
So that means the temperature you want to achieve.
这意味着你想要达到的温度。

37
Maybe when you turn the oven on it's only 100 degrees.
也许当你打开烤箱时，它只有100度。

38
So you have to wait for the desired temperature which is what is indicated in the recipe.
所以你必须等到所需温度，也就是食谱中所指示的温度。

39
That's right.
没错。

40
So this is what we want.
所以这就是我们想要的。

41
We want the desired temperature of 375 degrees.
我们想要的所需温度是375度。

42
So now we got that done and now we're going to make the batter.
现在我们完成了这一步，接下来要做面糊。

43
Alright, the batter is the liquid.
好的，面糊是液体。

44
It's the cake before the cake becomes a cake.
它是蛋糕在变成蛋糕之前的状态。

45
So it's usually like a very thick liquid, like a very thick, almost buttery, milky substance.
所以它通常是一种非常稠的液体，像是非常稠、几乎是黄油状的奶状物质。

46
And after you cook it, it turns hard.
烹饪后，它会变硬。

47
So batter is the liquid form.
所以面糊是液态形式。

48
Right.
对。

49
So when you're making a cake, you make batter.
所以当你在做蛋糕时，你会制作面糊。

50
Now it's different because if you're making pizza or you're making bread, it's not called batter.
现在不同的是，如果你在做比萨或面包，它就不叫面糊。

51
No, if you're making pizza or bread because those are thicker, they're called dough.
不，如果你在做比萨或面包，因为那些更厚，它们叫面团。

52
But when it's still like milk, you know, or water, it's like a liquid, we call it a batter.
但当它仍然像牛奶或水一样，是液体时，我们称之为面糊。

53
A batter.
面糊。

54
Very good.
非常好。

55
So obviously to make the batter we add sugar, we add butter, we add eggs.
所以显然要制作面糊，我们添加糖、黄油和鸡蛋。

56
And then what we want to do is we want to mix it.
然后我们想要做的是混合它。

57
And so the other person asks, well, what do I do?
于是另一个人问，我该怎么办？

58
Do I have to use a whisk or an electric mixer?
我需要用打蛋器还是电动搅拌器？

59
Alright, these are two very important tools that you will find in most kitchens.
好的，这两种工具在大多数厨房中都非常重要。

60
A whisk is like a spoon but it's made of metal and it's empty inside.
打蛋器就像勺子，但它是金属制成的，里面是空的。

61
And we use it for things like eggs or milk and sugar.
我们用它来处理鸡蛋、牛奶和糖。

62
And it can go very, very quickly.
它可以非常快速地搅拌。

63
It makes a kss, kss, kss, kss sound.
发出kss, kss, kss, kss的声音。

64
Like a whisk sound.
就像打蛋器的声音。

65
Like wire all around it.
像是周围有金属丝。

66
Yeah, it's wire that's woven together.
是的，它是编织在一起的金属丝。

67
And so it's a very, very handy tool.
所以这是一个非常方便的工具。

68
But you only use one hand to use it.
但你只用一只手来使用它。

69
But an electric mixer is what the name says.
但电动搅拌器就是它的名字所说的。

70
It's electric.
它是电动的。

71
You plug it in and it does the whisking automatically.
你插上电源，它会自动搅拌。

72
That's right.
没错。

73
Alright, so this is what we want to use.
好的，这就是我们想要使用的。

74
And before we put the batter into the baking pan, what we want to do first is we want to grease and flour the sides of the baking pan so then, you know, it won't stick.
在我们把面糊放入烤盘之前，首先要做的是给烤盘的边涂油和撒面粉，这样就不会粘了。

75
Alright, so to grease something means to use oil or butter to make sure that the meat or the dough does not stick later.
好的，涂油的意思是用油或黄油确保肉或面团以后不粘。

76
That's right.
没错。

77
So you can even use it for, obviously in cooking terms, if you put butter or something like this.
所以你可以在烹饪时使用它，如果你放黄油或类似的东西。

78
But even grease, like the black grease, maybe you need to put it in your door because maybe it's making that weird sound.
但即使是油脂，比如黑色油脂，也许你需要把它放在门上，因为它可能发出奇怪的声音。

79
Right, so to grease something is to add oil or to add butter in order to, you know, keep something from sticking.
对，所以涂油的意思是添加油或黄油，以防止某物粘住。

80
That's right.
没错。

81
Okay, so a lot of words there.
好的，有很多单词。

82
Now why don't we pass on to some phrases.

The real phrase you're going to see in a cookbook is preheat the oven.

86

87
So we have the prefix there, pre, to preheat something.
所以我们有前缀pre，表示预热某物。

88
And that means to begin or to start heating.
这意味着开始加热。

89
Now this is because when I turn my oven on, right Marco, it's not 450 degrees.
