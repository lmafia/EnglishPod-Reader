What's that person called?

47
Alright, so someone who works at a library is a librarian.

48
That's right.

So this person organizes the books, knows about all the books that are there, and basically takes care of the library.
所以这个人组织书籍，了解所有的书，并基本上照顾图书馆。

50
That's right.
没错。

51
So if you need help in the library, it's probably a good idea to ask the librarian where the book you're looking for is.
所以如果你在图书馆需要帮助，问图书管理员你要找的书在哪里是个好主意。

52
That's right.
没错。

53
And today we went in looking for a specific type of book.
今天我们是为了找特定类型的书而来的。

54
We wanted a book that had nursery rhymes.
我们想要一本有儿歌的书。

55
Alright, nursery rhymes.
好的，儿歌。

56
Now these are kind of like songs or poems, things that we tell little children and babies.

57
So, Mary had a little lamb, little lamb.
比如，玛丽有一只小羊，小羊。

58
That is a nursery rhyme.
那是一首儿歌。

59
It's a playful poem for children.
这是给孩子们的有趣诗歌。

60
That's right.
没错。

61
So obviously since we are looking for nursery rhyme books, the librarian told us that we need to go to the children's section.
所以显然因为我们在找儿歌书，图书管理员告诉我们需要去儿童区。

62
That's right.
没错。

63
But before we get to borrow this book, there are a couple of things we need because the person doesn't have a library card.
但在借这本书之前，我们需要一些东西，因为那个人没有图书馆卡。

64
Now the question is, how do I get a library card?
现在问题是，我该如何获得图书馆卡？

65
And what was the librarian's response, Marco?
图书管理员的回答是什么，Marco？

66
Well, it was pretty simple.
嗯，很简单。

67
All we needed was to see that person's driver's license or a utility bill.
我们只需要查看那个人的驾照或水电费账单。

68
Alright, so a driver's license is an ID card, an identification card that you get that allows you to drive a car.
好的，所以驾照是一种身份证明，允许你开车的身份证。

69
Now each state has a different kind of driver's license and different rules for how to get one, but this is a very common, almost the most common kind of identification in America.
每个州的驾照类型和获取规则不同，但这是美国最常见的身份证明。

70
That's right.
没错。

71
So basically you show them your driver's license and it has a picture of you there, your telephone number, and even your address.
所以基本上你给他们看你的驾照，上面有你的照片、电话号码，甚至你的地址。

72
That's right.
没错。

73
But not everybody has a driver's license.
但并不是每个人都有驾照。

74
Some people don't drive, some people can't drive, some people don't want to drive.
有些人不驾驶，有些人不能驾驶，有些人不想驾驶。

75
So they would have to show something else.
所以他们需要出示其他东西。

76
And a good way to show that you live somewhere is to show your utility bill.
显示你住在某个地方的好方法是出示你的水电费账单。

77
That's right.
没错。

78
So a utility is basically water, electricity, gas, or your telephone bill.
水电费基本上是水、电、气或电话账单。

79
And it arrives to your house and that's where it's, well obviously it says your address there and who the bill is directed to, so you can prove that you live there.
它会寄到你家，账单上显然会写上你的地址和账单的收件人，这样你就可以证明你住在那里。

80
That's right, because why would somebody else pay for the water at that house?
没错，因为为什么其他人会为那栋房子的水费买单呢？

81
It's obviously you.
显然是你。

82
So these are a couple kinds of identification you can use to get a library card.
所以这些是你可以用来获得图书馆卡的几种身份证明。

83
Alright, and while we're taking the books, we can borrow them for two weeks, but if we need to have them for a longer period of time, we can take them back to the library and have them renewed.
好的，当我们借书时，我们可以借两周，但如果我们需要更长时间，可以带回图书馆续借。

84
So to renew something, renew, means to continue to borrow it.
所以续借意味着继续借用。

85
You have to re-borrow.
你必须重新借用。

86
But we don't say re-borrow, we say renew.
但我们不说重新借用，我们说续借。

87
So that means we get it for another two weeks.
这意味着我们再借两周。

88
That's right.
没错。

89
So things that expire, usually you need to renew.
所以到期的东西，通常需要续借。

90
Like for example, your driver's license.
比如说，你的驾照。

91
Usually it will last maybe five years, but then you need to renew your driver's license.
通常它会持续五年，但之后你需要续借你的驾照。

92
And if you don't renew it, if you forget to renew something, maybe there'll be a problem.
如果你不续借，如果你忘记续借，可能会有问题。

93
Like in the case of the library, you have to pay for the late fees.
比如在图书馆的情况下，你必须支付逾期费用。

94
Your book is overdue, you have to pay for it.
你的书逾期了，你必须支付。

95
Or in the case of a driver's license, if your driver's license is overdue, well, you probably have to get a new one.
或者在驾照的情况下，如果你的驾照逾期了，你可能需要重新申请一张。

96
That's right.
没错。

97
Okay, so a lot of vocab there.
好的，有很多词汇。

98
Why don't we review everything, and we'll be right back.
我们来复习一下所有内容，我们马上回来。
