It really is an amazing work of architecture and art.

18
The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb, the walls are covered with gems and emeralds.

23

24
Well, let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year.

26
Alright, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

27
So let's talk about these very interesting places all over the world, now on Language Takeaway.
现在让我们在Language Takeaway中谈谈这些世界各地非常有趣的地方。

28
Language Takeaway.
Language Takeaway。

29
So the set phrase for this, Marco, is the seven wonders of the world.
所以Marco，这个短语是世界七大奇迹。

30
Now the key here is the word wonder.
这里的关键是“奇迹”这个词。

31
What is a wonder?
什么是奇迹？

32
Right, a wonder is something very amazing, incredible.
对，奇迹是非常惊人、不可思议的东西。

33
It's something that's beyond your imagination almost.
它几乎是超出你想象的东西。

34
That's right, you can't even imagine how man or how someone created it.
没错，你甚至无法想象人类或某人是如何创造它的。

35
And so wonderful is a similar word, that's an adjective, something that's just great, fantastic, is wonderful.
所以“美妙”是一个类似的词，是形容词，表示某事很棒、很奇妙。

36
A wonder is something very, very special.
奇迹是非常特别的东西。

37
And here we have seven of them.
这里我们有七个。

38
That's right.
没错。

39
So it's a list, basically, that you can see even online about these wonders all over the world.
所以这基本上是一个名单，你甚至可以在网上看到这些世界各地的奇迹。

40
And they're so special because they are amazing works of art and architecture.
它们之所以特别，是因为它们是惊人的艺术和建筑作品。

41
And starting off with one of the most famous ones is in China.
开始时最著名的一个在中国。

42
It's the Great Wall of China.
它是中国的长城。

43
I think what's special about this, I've heard, is that when astronauts are in space it's so long and so distinct they can actually see the Great Wall.
我听说这个地方特别之处在于，当宇航员在太空时，它如此漫长且独特，他们实际上可以看到长城。

44
Yeah, that's what I've heard as well.
是的，我也听说过。

45
It's a very long wall, thousands of kilometers long.
它是一面非常长的墙，长达数千公里。

46
That's right, and it goes east to west all across the northern border of China.
没错，它从东到西贯穿中国北部边界。

47
That's right.
没错。

48
So it's a very big wall and what's interesting about it is that it was built such a long time ago and that the techniques used to make it were very special.
所以它是一面非常大的墙，令人感兴趣的是，它是在很久以前建造的，建造它的技术非常特别。

49
That's right, and sometimes you might hear us talk about the Great Wall instead of the Great Wall of China.
没错，有时你可能会听我们说长城，而不是中国的长城。

50
And so that's just a hint, it's easy to say Great Wall, you can say them both ways though.
这只是一个提示，简单说长城，你可以两种方式说。

51
Exactly.
没错。

52
Now moving west towards India we have another very amazing work of architecture, it's called the Taj Mahal.
现在向西移动到印度，我们有另一项非常惊人的建筑作品，叫做泰姬陵。

53
Now the Taj Mahal is in North India in a city called Agra and it's very special because it's massive, it's very big, and it's all white marble.
泰姬陵位于印度北部的阿格拉市，它非常特别，因为它巨大，完全是白色大理石。

54
That's right, and it's interesting because this place, the Taj Mahal, is not really a temple, it was actually a tomb.
没错，有趣的是，这个地方，泰姬陵，实际上并不是一座寺庙，而是一个墓。

55
All right, now that's an interesting word to look at.
好吧，现在这是一个有趣的词。

56
A tomb, a tomb is a place where we Bury someone, you know, after someone dies.
墓，墓是我们埋葬某人的地方，你知道，在某人去世后。

57
Maybe if you have a lot of money, you're very rich, you want to put that body in a very special sacred place and that's called a tomb.
也许如果你有很多钱，你非常富有，你想把那个尸体放在一个非常特别的神圣地方，这就叫做墓。

58
That's right, so this is actually what the Taj Mahal is.
没错，这实际上就是泰姬陵。

59
Now we saw in the dialogue that the entire complex of the Taj Mahal is made of white marble, so when we talk about the entire complex, what do we mean?
我们在对话中看到，整个泰姬陵建筑群是由白色大理石制成的，那么当我们谈论整个建筑群时，我们是什么意思？

60
Well, complex here is a noun, you might have heard it in other situations where it's an adjective, it means something different, but here a complex means many buildings together, right?
嗯，建筑群在这里是一个名词，你可能在其他情况下听过它作为形容词，意思不同，但这里的建筑群是指许多建筑在一起，对吗？

61
So you can say the Taj Mahal is one building, but the Taj Mahal complex maybe has four or five buildings together, so a side temple and a gate house, and so we say a complex is a grouping of buildings.
所以你可以说泰姬陵是一座建筑，但泰姬陵建筑群可能有四或五座建筑在一起，比如一个侧庙和一个门楼，所以我们说建筑群是建筑的组合。

62
That's right, very good.
没错，非常好。

63
So now let's move on, let's take a look at Language Takeaway Part 2 and let's continue talking about these wonders of the world.
现在让我们继续，看看Language Takeaway第二部分，继续谈论这些世界奇迹。

64
Now the top of our list in Language Takeaway Part 2 is actually a place I would love to go to, I've never been there.
现在我们在Language Takeaway第二部分的名单顶部实际上是一个我很想去的地方，我从未去过。

65
It's in Jordan, which is a country in the Middle East, and it's called Petra.
它在约旦，这是一个位于中东的国家，叫做佩特拉。

66
Petra, that's right.
佩特拉，没错。

67
This is actually a city, but it's also known as the Lost City of Petra, right?
这实际上是一个城市，但它也被称为失落的佩特拉城，对吗？

68
That's right, and what's unique about this city is that the city is built, it's carved out of stone in this cliff, so it's not just pieces of stone put together, it's actually inside the rocks.
没错，这个城市的独特之处在于，它是从悬崖上的石头雕刻而成的，所以它不仅仅是把石头拼在一起，而是实际上在岩石内部。

69
Exactly.
没错。

70
So it's very famous, you've probably seen it in movies like Indiana Jones, there's a big part of the scenes that go on inside Petra.
所以它非常著名，你可能在《印第安纳·琼斯》等电影中见过它，里面有很多场景发生在佩特拉。

71
Very special place, and again very unique.
非常特别的地方，再次非常独特。

72
Now the next site is actually very far away in South America, and again it's ancient and very intricate.
现在下一个地方实际上在南美，非常遥远，而且又古老又复杂。

73
It's called Machu Picchu.
它叫马丘比丘。

74
That's right, so this is in one of those very old cities that are actually in ruins now, and the interesting thing about it is that it's very high up in like a little mountain.
没错，这实际上是一个非常古老的城市，现在已经是废墟，令人感兴趣的是，它位于一个小山上。

75
And those mountains there, those are the Andes, right?
那些山是安第斯山脉，对吗？

76
That's right.
没错。

77
So Machu Picchu, also a very famous place.
所以马丘比丘也是一个非常著名的地方。

78
Many visitors from all over the world go there as well.
来自世界各地的许多游客也会去那里。

79
And another main attraction around the world are the pyramids.
另一个主要的世界景点是金字塔。

80
So we have some pyramids in Egypt, I think those are the most well-known ones.
所以我们在埃及有一些金字塔，我认为那些是最著名的。

81
That's right, the pyramids in Egypt, like the pyramid at Giza, are very big structures.
没错，埃及的金字塔，比如吉萨的金字塔，是非常大的结构。

82
I mean they're huge, and they were built thousands of years ago, but they're still here because they were built so well.
我是说它们巨大，建于数千年前，但它们仍然存在，因为它们建造得非常好。

83
But they're also very famous pyramids, like the one we heard about today in the dialogue in Mexico.
但还有一些非常著名的金字塔，比如我们今天在对话中听到的墨西哥的金字塔。

84
That's right.
没错。

85
It's a little bit different though, because the pyramids, as most of us know them, they're very smooth on the sides, you would say.
不过这有点不同，因为金字塔，正如我们大多数人所知，它们的侧面非常光滑。

86
Yeah, you can't climb on them, really.
是的，你真的不能爬上去。

87
Right.
对。

88
Well this one in Mexico actually has kind of like steps, so it's a different type of pyramid, but the shape is very similar.
而墨西哥的这个金字塔实际上有点像台阶，所以它是一种不同类型的金字塔，但形状非常相似。

89
All right, so the pyramids here are in a place called Chichen Itza, you might have heard of that.
好吧，这里的金字塔位于一个叫奇琴伊察的地方，你可能听说过。

90
And we have another place though, which is also in South America, in the city of Rio de Janeiro.
但我们还有另一个地方，也在南美，位于里约热内卢市。

91
Now this one is actually a statue, right?
这个实际上是一个雕像，对吗？

92
That's right, it's called the Christ Redeemer.
没错，叫做基督救世主。

93
It's a very big statue, very famous, you've seen it maybe in pictures.
这是一个非常大的雕像，非常著名，你可能在照片中见过它。

94
It's a statue of Jesus with his arms open.
这是一个耶稣的雕像，双臂张开。

95
Now the word redeemer, okay, a redeemer is a person, someone who does something, who redeems.
现在“救世主”这个词，好的，救世主是一个人，做某事的人，拯救的人。

96
What does it mean to be a redeemer?
成为救世主意味着什么？

97
Well a redeemer is a person that saves souls, for example.
嗯，救世主是拯救灵魂的人，例如。

98
So if you redeem yourself, you're redeeming yourself of your sins maybe.
所以如果你救赎自己，你可能是在救赎自己的罪。

99
Well yeah, you're taking value back, right?
嗯，是的，你是在恢复价值，对吧？

100
And so in the case of Jesus, he is taking away the sins of the world, and he's redeeming, you know, that's why his arms are out.
所以在耶稣的情况下，他正在消除世界的罪孽，他在救赎，所以他的手臂是张开的。

101
He's redeeming all people.
他正在拯救所有人。

102
And that's the idea I think behind the Christ Redeemer statue.
这就是我认为基督救世主雕像背后的理念。

103
So the verb redeem, like you can use it in everyday life if you take a coupon and you redeem it.
所以动词“redeem”，就像你在日常生活中使用的，如果你拿着优惠券去兑换。

104
That means you, yeah, you collect the value.
这意味着你，没错，你收集了价值。

105
You collect the value, right?
你收集了价值，对吧？

106
So you can use it, actually, this word in everyday life.
所以你实际上可以在日常生活中使用这个词。

107
You can.
可以。

108
And moving on now towards Europe, we have the famous Colosseum.
现在我们继续前往欧洲，我们有著名的斗兽场。

109
Ooh, now I love this one.

110
I've actually been there, and I know you have too recently.

111

But this is a circular, like a round stadium.

113
So it's a place where you play sports.

114
Well, you did.
嗯，你是说。

115
It's from, you know, thousands of years ago, the Roman Empire, and it's in very good shape, I would say.
它来自，知道吗，几千年前的罗马帝国，我会说它保持得很好。

116
You can still see it.
你仍然可以看到它。

117
Yeah, so it's generally called the Colosseum, although a Colosseum as we know it now can also be the same thing, right?
是的，所以它通常被称为斗兽场，尽管我们现在所知的斗兽场也可以是同样的东西，对吧？

118
A structure where sports or activities are played.
一个进行体育或活动的结构。

119
Basically, yeah, a Colosseum is an old stadium.
基本上，是的，斗兽场是一个古老的体育场。

120
But the Colosseum, like you said, is definitely the Colosseum in Rome.
但正如你所说，斗兽场绝对是罗马的斗兽场。

121
That's right.
没错。

122
And we've probably seen movies of ancient Rome where sports or activities were taking place, specifically gladiator fights.
我们可能看过古罗马的电影，其中进行着体育或活动，特别是角斗士的战斗。

123
So that's our word there, gladiator.
所以我们的词是角斗士。

124
Yeah, that's right.
是的，没错。

125
So a gladiator is actually a person.
所以角斗士实际上是一个人。

126
And a gladiator was a man who, thousands of years ago during the Roman Empire, would fight maybe other men or animals, and he had to fight to stay alive.
角斗士是一个人，几千年前在罗马帝国期间，他可能与其他人或动物战斗，他必须战斗以求生存。

127
So that was his profession, basically, to be a gladiator.
所以这基本上是他的职业，成为一个角斗士。

128
So now as you are a boxer, back then you were a gladiator.
所以现在你是一个拳击手，那个时候你是一个角斗士。

129
Yeah, and there are actually some very famous movies about gladiators, like the movie Gladiator with Russell Crowe.
是的，实际上有一些非常著名的关于角斗士的电影，比如拉塞尔·克劳的电影《角斗士》。

130
So it's a pretty common word these days.
