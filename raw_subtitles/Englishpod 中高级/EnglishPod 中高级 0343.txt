In fact, there are some parts of America where they're very famous for their lobster, like Maine.

112
Now, these are animals that are hard on the outside and soft and white on the inside and they're quite difficult to eat.
这些动物外壳坚硬，内部柔软洁白，吃起来相当困难。

So, they look like big rocks, basically.
所以，它们看起来像大石头。

125
And when you open them inside, you have meat.

126

134
Now, while oysters are big and sometimes quite shiny, clams are smaller, usually white or gray.

135
And they have lines on them and they're shells that you open up and you eat the meat from inside.
它们有条纹，壳可以打开，里面有肉。

136
Right, so I guess if you've ever been on the beach and you're collecting little seashells, usually those are kind of like clams.

Calamari means that it's squid that's been cooked so that people can eat it.
鱿鱼意味着已经烹饪好的鱿鱼，供人们食用。

160
Okay, so basically calamari and squid are the same thing.
好的，所以基本上鱿鱼和鱿鱼是同一种东西。

161
They are the same animal, but calamari means that it's prepared to eat.
它们是同一种动物，但鱿鱼意味着它是准备好吃的。

162
Yes, and usually it's fried, so when squid is fried, it becomes hard, chewy.
是的，通常是油炸的，所以当鱿鱼被油炸时，它变得坚硬，有嚼劲。

163
And that's what calamari tastes like.
这就是鱿鱼的味道。

It's quite chewy.
它相当有嚼劲。

All right, so seafood, we said, usually has the connotation of being a little bit pricey.
好的，所以海鲜，我们说，通常意味着价格有点贵。

187
Why do you think that is?
你认为这是为什么？

188
I think it's pricey because the best seafood doesn't come from seafood farms.
我认为贵是因为最好的海鲜并不是来自海鲜养殖场。

189
It comes from people who go in boats and they collect the seafood in nets.
它来自那些乘船出海，用网捕捞海鲜的人。

190
And also, there are fewer and fewer places now in America where you can find this kind of food because some places have experienced overfishing.
而且，现在美国能找到这种食物的地方越来越少，因为有些地方经历了过度捕捞。

191
Too many people are trying to fish.

192
And also, some places just don't have the right climate for certain animals.
而且，有些地方根本没有适合某些动物的气候。

193
Right.

So, for example, in the United States, you do have...
例如，在美国，你确实有...

195
Well, the whole country is covered in the West Coast by the Pacific Ocean.
嗯，整个国家的西海岸被太平洋覆盖。

196
The East Coast, you have the Atlantic.

So, obviously, you do have some coasts.
所以，显然，你确实有一些海岸。

198
But if you're in the middle of the United States, it's probably hard to get seafood.
但如果你在美国中部，可能很难找到海鲜。

199
So, I imagine it's very expensive.
所以，我想这非常昂贵。

200
It can be very, very expensive.
可能非常非常昂贵。

201
So, oftentimes, we get lake food.
所以，很多时候，我们吃湖里的食物。

202
It's different kind of fish, but we don't have lobsters.
这是不同种类的鱼，但我们没有龙虾。

203
But you'll find that in the West, you get very good salmon because Alaska in the Northwest is very famous for salmon from the Pacific.
但你会发现，在西部，你能吃到非常好的三文鱼，因为阿拉斯加在西北部以太平洋的三文鱼而闻名。

204
And in the East, it's very famous for lobster and crab, which are delicious.
而在东部，它以龙虾和螃蟹而闻名，这些都很美味。

205
Now, even though it's famous for lobster and crab, it's still relatively expensive compared to other dishes.
现在，尽管它以龙虾和螃蟹而闻名，但与其他菜肴相比，仍然相对昂贵。

206
Like, for example, I think a lobster... How much would a lobster dinner cost?

207

So, it's very interesting, but some countries, seafood is very, very inexpensive.

所以，能够去那里随便吃海鲜而不必花300美元吃一顿饭，真是太好了。
