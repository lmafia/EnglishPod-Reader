所以基本上这是某人跪下来说，亲爱的，我想和你永远在一起，你愿意嫁给我吗？

A reception is basically the party part of the wedding where you drink and eat and listen to music and dance.
接待基本上是婚礼的派对部分，你可以喝酒、吃东西、听音乐和跳舞。

85
Okay, a venue.
好吧，场地。

86
So as you said, the reception is the party and the venue is the place where you have it.

Now a venue is not a specific word, right?
现在场地不是一个特定的词，对吧？

88
You can use venue for many different places.

现在继续，当我们谈到接待场地的食物时，我们需要有人来做饭和准备，这时我们会雇用餐饮服务。

113
