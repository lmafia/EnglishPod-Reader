We've got one person talking, telling you how to make the perfect sandwich.

That's right.

7
She's a chef, and she's going to teach us.
她是一位厨师，将教我们。

8
She's going to talk about all the ingredients and some tips on how to make a sandwich.

10
This is going to be a really good lesson.
这将是一次非常好的课程。

11
And I'm already hungry thinking about it, so let's listen to the dialogue.
我已经因为想到它而感到饿了，所以让我们来听对话。

12
We'll be back in a moment.
我们马上回来。

13
Welcome to our show.
欢迎来到我们的节目。

14
Today I'm going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich.
今天我将教你如何制作完美的三明治。

15
Are you ready?
你准备好了吗？

16
Let's get started.
让我们开始吧。

17
Let's start with the basics.
先从基础开始。

18
Bread.
面包。

19
Bread is an important ingredient here.
面包是这里的重要配料。

20
You need to remember one thing.
你需要记住一件事。

21
Choose the bread according to the following criteria.
根据以下标准选择面包。

22
Freshness, crumb, and color.
新鲜度、松软度和颜色。

23
If you want a closed sandwich, I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.
如果你想要一个封闭的三明治，我建议你先把面包在烤面包机或烤箱中烤一下，或者稍微烤一下，直到它变成浅棕色。

24
Now that our bread is ready, let's talk about the ingredients.
现在我们的面包准备好了，来谈谈配料。

25
Of course, each person's palette is different, but I'm going to give you a few tips that you'll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich.
当然，每个人的口味不同，但我会给你一些建议，让你能把任何三明治变成完美的三明治。

26
I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.
我强烈建议你在三明治中放入新鲜蔬菜。

27
Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light.
不要低估它们，因为它们在形成味道方面起着重要作用，会让三明治更加清新和轻盈。

28
The best choices here are evident.
最好的选择显而易见。

29
Cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chili, lettuce, and of course herbs.
黄瓜、西红柿、洋葱、甜椒或辣椒、生菜，当然还有香草。

30
You can't go wrong with them.
你不会错的。

31
As for aubergines, mushrooms, and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.
至于茄子、蘑菇和芦笋，我建议你先用一点橄榄油稍微烤一下。

32
Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich.
最后但同样重要的是，我们可以添加多种调味品到我们的完美三明治中。

33
We can be subtle and add just a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup, or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor.
我们可以简单地加一点盐和胡椒，或者结合芥末酱、蛋黄酱、番茄酱，甚至鱼子酱，以达到更强的味道。

34
It's always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt.
把三明治切成三角形或易于处理的小块总是个好主意，以避免所有配料掉出来弄脏你的衬衫。

35
That's all the time we have for today, but join us next time where we'll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna.
今天的时间就到这里，但请下次加入我们，我们将讨论如何制作完美的千层面。

36
Till next time!
下次见！

37
Alright, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

38
So obviously, I think she knows what she's talking about.
显然，我认为她知道自己在说什么。

39
This is going to be a great sandwich.
这将是一个很棒的三明治。

40
Alright, so she mentioned a lot of ingredients, a couple of different words that we might not understand.
好的，她提到了很多配料，还有一些我们可能不理解的词。

41
So let's take a look at them now in language takeaway.
让我们现在在语言学习中看看它们。

42
Language takeaway.
语言学习。

43
Okay, at the beginning of this monologue, as I said, the chef is talking about things that you need to look for in a bread, because bread is the base of a sandwich.
好的，在这个独白的开始，正如我所说，厨师在谈论你需要在面包中寻找的东西，因为面包是三明治的基础。

44
And she mentioned the word crumb.
她提到了“松软度”这个词。

45
Okay, yeah, she said freshness, crumb, and color.
好的，是的，她说新鲜度、松软度和颜色。

46
So what does she mean by crumb of the bread?
那么她所说的面包的松软度是什么意思？

47
Okay, so crumb, a crumb, is a very, very, very, very small piece of bread.
好的，松软度是非常非常非常小的面包碎片。

48
Like when you put bread in a toaster, maybe it's what falls down, actually.
就像你把面包放进烤面包机时，可能掉下来的东西。

49
We call them breadcrumbs sometimes.
我们有时称它们为面包屑。

50
You can cook with them, but they're basically little pieces of bread that fall off, little grains.
你可以用它们做饭，但它们基本上是掉落的小面包块，小颗粒。

51
Okay, yeah, so usually it happens all the time.
好的，是的，通常这总是发生。

52
You're having cookies or you're having some bread, you bite into it, and little pieces of bread or cookie fall down.
你在吃饼干或面包时，咬下去，面包或饼干的小块掉下来。

53
Those are called crumbs.
那些叫做“松软的”。

54
That's right, and this is a very... and I want to remind everyone that the word crumb has a B on the end.
没错，我想提醒大家，松软度这个词的结尾有个B。

55
C-R-U-M-B.
C-R-U-M-B。

56
But we don't pronounce the B.
但我们不发音B。

57
We just say crumb.
我们只说“松软度”。

58
Yeah, you don't say crumb.
是的，你不说“松软度”。

59
No.
不。

60
Okay, so just crumb.
好的，所以就是“松软度”。

61
Yeah, be careful with that one.
是的，要小心这个。

62
All right, so we have to keep a lookout for the crumb of the bread.
好的，所以我们必须留意面包的松软度。

63
I guess how fresh and how sometimes when you squeeze bread it makes a nice little sound.
我想知道它的新鲜程度，有时当你挤压面包时会发出好听的声音。

64
Crunch, crunch.
咔嚓，咔嚓。

65
Exactly.
正是如此。

66
So, but she's also recommending a couple of different ingredients, and she said, well, it depends on each person's palate.
不过，她还推荐了一些不同的配料，她说，这取决于每个人的口味。

67
So after we've chosen our bread, she talks about a closed sandwich and maybe toasting it.
所以在我们选择了面包后，她谈到了封闭的三明治，也许是烤一下。

68
Okay, so there are two options for sandwiches.
好的，三明治有两种选择。

69
You might see these on menus as well as when you're cooking yourself.
你可能在菜单上看到这些，也可能在自己做饭时看到。

70
A closed sandwich means you have two pieces of bread, one on the bottom and one on top.
封闭的三明治意味着你有两片面包，一片在底部，一片在顶部。

71
It's closed.
它是封闭的。

72
Okay.
好的。

73
But the opposite is an open sandwich.
但相反的是开放式三明治。

74
That means you only have one piece of bread and then maybe you have some meat on top.
这意味着你只有一片面包，可能在上面放一些肉。

75
Oh, okay.
哦，好的。

76
Actually, I always thought that for it to be a sandwich you had to have two pieces of bread.
实际上，我一直认为要成为三明治，你必须有两片面包。

77
Well, now when you... I would challenge you to look on Google for open-faced sandwich or open sandwich.
好吧，现在当你... 我挑战你在谷歌上搜索开放式三明治或开放三明治。

78
You'll find some very interesting things.
你会发现一些非常有趣的东西。

79
Yeah, I've had them.
是的，我吃过。

80
Actually, you can put some meat and some cheese just on top of a piece of bread and you're done.
实际上，你可以把一些肉和奶酪放在一片面包上就完成了。

81
I'm a huge fan of those.
我非常喜欢那些。

82
Yeah.
是的。

83
So that's a closed sandwich though when you have two pieces of bread and the meat in the middle.
所以当你有两片面包和中间的肉时，那是封闭的三明治。

84
And after that she talks a little bit about people's tastes and what people want.
然后她谈了一点关于人们的口味和人们想要什么。

85
But she used a very special word.
但她使用了一个非常特别的词。

86
That's right.
没错。

87
She said each person's palate is different.
她说每个人的口味都不同。

88
Okay, a palate in the context of food and taste means the way that food flavors affect a person individually.
好的，口味在食物和味道的上下文中意味着食物的味道如何影响每个人。

89
That's right.
没错。

90
So sometimes you say that some people have a very good palate so they can maybe tell the difference between a wine from 1978 and a wine from 1980 or something like that.
所以有时你会说有些人有很好的口味，他们可以区分1978年的葡萄酒和1980年的葡萄酒或类似的东西。

91
That's right.
没错。

92
So you can have a palate, a good palate for wine, but also in this case we're talking about food, I could say I have a very sensitive palate so I don't like to use very very strong flavors.
所以你可以有一个口味，对葡萄酒有很好的口味，但在这种情况下，我们谈论的是食物，我可以说我有一个非常敏感的口味，所以我不喜欢使用非常强烈的味道。

93
Okay, so the palate is basically your taste.
好的，所以口味基本上就是你的味觉。

94
It's actually a physical part of your mouth.
它实际上是你嘴里的一个物理部分。

95
It's the top of your mouth.
是你嘴的顶部。

96
Mm-hmm.
嗯嗯。

97
Where your tongue can touch the top of your mouth.
你的舌头可以触碰到你嘴的顶部。

98
The roof of your mouth, exactly.
你的上颚，正是如此。

99
And it's not just your ability to taste sweet.
而且这不仅仅是你品尝甜味的能力。

100
It's sweet and salty and sour and all these different flavors.
还有甜、咸、酸和所有这些不同的味道。

101
Okay, so a person's palate.
好的，所以一个人的味觉。

102
Now, herbs, right?
现在，香草，对吧？

103
Now moving on to the main ingredients.
现在转到主要成分。

104
You mentioned a lot of easy ones like tomatoes, onions, lettuce, but then we got into a little bit more specific things like, for example, this word that's always mispronounced, herbs.
你提到很多简单的，比如西红柿、洋葱、生菜，但接着我们谈到了一些更具体的东西，比如这个总是发音错误的词，香草。

105
Actually, you can say herbs.
其实，你可以说香草。

106
It's a very British thing to do though.
这是一种非常英式的说法。

107
Americans and Canadians say herbs.
美国人和加拿大人说香草。

108
It has an H in the front.
前面有个H。

109
That's why it's confusing.
所以这很让人困惑。

110
Okay, so we can accept basically if somebody says herbs, but I guess in American English it's more commonly the... it's more commonly pronounced as a silent H.
好的，所以基本上如果有人说香草我们可以接受，但我想在美式英语中更常见的是...更常发音为无声的H。

111
That's right.
没错。

112
Herbs.
香草。

113

150
Okay, so now we have our vegetables, we have our bread, but now we need to add a little bit of extra flavor to the sandwich.
好的，所以现在我们有了蔬菜，有了面包，但现在我们需要给三明治添加一点额外的风味。

176
Okay, so a lot of words there, a lot of interesting things going on in our sandwich.

177
Why don't we move on now to Fluency Builder, where we're going to take a look at some phrases.

Now our chef, when she continued talking about her sandwich, she said, I would strongly recommend that you use fresh vegetables in your sandwich.
现在我们的厨师，当她继续谈论她的三明治时，她说，我强烈建议你在三明治中使用新鲜蔬菜。

194
Okay, so you can say I would recommend this, but to strongly recommend is to have a very, very strong feeling about something.

212
So now for our last phrase, right?

214
She when she started talking about the condiment, she said, last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments.

这是一个固定短语，你会经常听到这些词一起出现。

217
Last but not least, what could this possibly mean?

220
But why not least?
但为什么不重要呢？

221
Well, it's not least important.
嗯，它并不是最不重要的。

222
Just because it's last, it doesn't mean that it's not important.
仅仅因为它是最后的，并不意味着它不重要。

223
Okay, so maybe there are many people who have to give presentations in school, and I'm the very, very last person to go, the teacher will say last but not least, Catherine.
好的，所以也许有很多人必须在学校做演讲，而我是最后一个发言的人，老师会说最后但同样重要的是，凯瑟琳。

224
That's right.
没错。

225
Makes me feel better.
让我感觉好一些。

226
Because you're saying you're last, but it doesn't mean you're not important.
因为你在说你是最后一个，但这并不意味着你不重要。

227
Exactly.

228
So when you want to make sure that the last point of your presentation or what you're talking about is not ignored, or you just you want to make sure that it everyone knows that it's also very important.
所以当你想确保你演讲的最后一点或你所谈论的内容不会被忽视，或者你只是想确保每个人都知道它也非常重要时。

So we can say a touch.

So it's so you're just saying, maybe you'll hear this in maybe a cooking show, or you'll read it in books when they'll say a pinch of salt, or a touch of salt or a dash of salt.
所以你只是在说，也许你会在烹饪节目中听到这个，或者你会在书中看到它们说一撮盐，或者少许盐或一点盐。

You could even say it about other things.

If you want a closed sandwich, I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.
如果你想要一个封闭的三明治，我建议你先把面包在烤面包机、烤箱中烤一下，或者稍微烤一下，直到它变成浅棕色。

267
Now that our bread is ready, let's talk about the ingredients.

You can't go wrong with them.

As for aubergines, mushrooms, and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.

275
Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich.
最后但同样重要的是，我们有各种各样的调味品可以添加到我们的完美三明治中。

276
We can be subtle and add just a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup, or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor.
我们可以微妙地添加一点盐和胡椒，或者我们可以结合芥末酱、蛋黄酱、番茄酱，甚至鱼子酱来获得更强的味道。

It's always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt.
将三明治切成三角形或易于处理的块总是个好主意，以避免所有配料掉出来弄脏你的衬衫。

是的，当你吃一顿丰盛的饭时，似乎有时候地方会给你很大、很重的三明治，里面有火腿、意大利腊肠，还有很多东西，所以它们非常填饱肚子。
