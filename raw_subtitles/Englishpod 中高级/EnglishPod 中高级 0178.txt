56
Right exactly and this other word is actually okay to use and when you're talking about presents or you're talking about decorations you say something is tacky.
对，确切地说，这个词实际上是可以使用的，当你谈论礼物或装饰时，你可以说某样东西是俗气的。

57
Okay well if you call something tacky, this is an adjective so something is tacky, it's really a matter of opinion.

59
Maybe that's a problem.
也许这就是问题所在。

61
I think that clothing with lots of bows and glitter and shiny things are very tacky.

63
That's right.
没错。

64
So as you say it's opinion because you think that clothes with bows and Teddy bears on it is tacky.
所以正如你所说，这是观点，因为你认为带有蝴蝶结和泰迪熊的衣服是俗气的。

Well somebody else can think no it's it's cute it's nice.
而其他人可能会认为不，这很可爱，很好。

66
Exactly you know you can also and you can also describe things that people do as being tacky.

All right so the word is tacky and moving on we talked about a gift certificate.
好吧，词是俗气，接下来我们谈到了礼品卡。

71
You should get your mom a gift certificate.

74
Okay so you could have a birth certificate for example it says when you were born where you were born.
好吧，你可以有出生证明，例如，它说明你出生的时间和地点。

75
But in this case a gift certificate is a piece of paper that you give someone to say you have this much money to spend at this store.
但在这种情况下，礼品卡是一张纸，给某人说你有这么多钱可以在这家商店消费。

76
So I could give my mom a gift certificate for a bookstore for fifty dollars and she can go with this piece of paper and spend fifty dollars for free.
所以我可以给我妈妈一张价值五十美元的书店礼品卡，她可以拿着这张纸花五十美元，免费购物。

77
Okay because I already paid.
好吧，因为我已经付过钱了。

78
Yeah so it's kind of a a very popular thing to do because sometimes as in the dialogue you don't know the person's size or you don't know if they like this color.
是的，所以这是一种非常流行的做法，因为有时在对话中你不知道对方的尺码，或者你不知道他们是否喜欢这个颜色。

79
So you're just like look here is you know a gift certificate for a hundred dollars go to the store that I know you really like and get yourself whatever you want something nice.
所以你就像，看看这是你知道的，价值一百美元的礼品卡，去我知道你真的喜欢的商店，买你想要的任何东西，买点好的。

81
But it's less tacky than giving that person cash right?

151
This is a very important construction and it doesn't quite make sense when you hear it so that's what we're going to explain right now.

152

所以你具体说明鞋子有多大或多小，像戒指或鞋子或任何有尺码的东西。

165
Exactly.

166
But the funny thing is you can also exaggerate you could say oh this sweater is so ugly it's ten sizes too big for me.

And our third phrase for today when the person said yeah you're right when it comes down to it I can be pretty tacky.

174
So we looked at tacky but what does he mean when it comes down to it.
所以我们看到了“俗气”，但他说“说到底”是什么意思。

175
Okay well this is very confusing sometimes when we talk about phrases in English but when it comes down to it as a way to say in reality or actually or the truth is yes.
好吧，这在我们谈论英语短语时有时会很困惑，但“说到底”是一种说“实际上”或“事实是”的方式。

所以这是一种说某事是真实的方式。

177
Okay so I can say when it comes down to it Catherine is a good friend.

182
And for our fourth phrase when the person said yeah tell me about it what does it mean tell me about it tell me about what.
对于我们的第四个短语，当那个人说“是的，跟我说说”时，这是什么意思，跟我说说什么。

187
