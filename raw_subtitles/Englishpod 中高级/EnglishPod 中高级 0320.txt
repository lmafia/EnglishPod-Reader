I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try, and I have been here for two years already.
我无论多努力都无法在职业阶梯上进步，我已经在这里两年了。

14
Well, have you thought of getting an MBA?

18
The business schools won't be interested in me.

19
Nonsense!
胡说！

20
The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT.
商学院通过一个叫GMAT的考试来衡量你的能力。

21
GMAT?

Okay, this sounds a little tough.
好吧，这听起来有点难。

28
How am I supposed to practice for this?

29
Up to you.

Alright, we're back, so now let's talk about some of the language we found on Language Takeaway.

36
Language Takeaway.
语言收获。

37
Alright, so there's a lot of great stuff here.
好的，这里有很多很棒的内容。

38
The first one we've got is actually more about a job than school.
我们首先提到的其实是关于工作而不是学校。

39
This is the career ladder.
这是职业阶梯。

40
That's right, Ash is complaining how he can't seem to make any progress in the career ladder.
没错，Ash在抱怨他似乎无法在职业阶梯上取得任何进展。

41
So, what is a career ladder?
那么，什么是职业阶梯？

42
Well, we know what a ladder is.
嗯，我们知道什么是梯子。

43
A ladder is a tool that you use to climb from a low place to a high place.
梯子是你用来从低处爬到高处的工具。

44
So, for example, if you want to go on the roof of your house, you have to use a ladder.
例如，如果你想上你家屋顶，你必须使用梯子。

45
A career ladder is, it's like an analogy.
职业阶梯就像一个比喻。

46
You know, when you start a career, you start at the bottom, and you climb up, up, up to the top.
你知道，当你开始职业生涯时，你从底部开始，然后向上爬，爬到顶端。

47
So, going from the bottom to maybe the president of an organization.
所以，从底部到组织的总裁。

48
So that's called a career ladder.
这就叫做职业阶梯。

49
Yeah, climbing from the bottom of a career area, like for example, being the mailman in an office building, to being the president of that office.
是的，从职业领域的底部爬升，比如在办公楼里做邮递员，到成为那个办公室的总裁。

50
Okay, so this is what Ash is complaining about, that it's hard, or he can't really seem to go up the career ladder.
好吧，这就是Ash在抱怨的，他觉得很难，或者他似乎无法在职业阶梯上向上爬。

51
And so Mindy suggests that he should take the GMAT and go into graduate school.
所以Mindy建议他应该参加GMAT并进入研究生院。

52
So, as we said, the GMAT is a test that you take, but what does it stand for?
正如我们所说，GMAT是你参加的考试，但它代表什么？

53
What is GMAT?
GMAT是什么？

54
GMAT stands for Graduate Management Admission Test.
GMAT代表研究生管理入学考试。

55
Okay, so that's the test that you take when you want to go to school.
好的，这就是你想上学时参加的考试。

56
So, you have to send your scores to the admissions office of the school you want to go to, and they will decide if they're high enough or not.
所以，你必须将你的成绩发送到你想去的学校的招生办公室，他们会决定是否足够高。

57
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

58
So, not everyone can go to graduate school, and you have to take this test and pass it, basically.
所以，并不是每个人都能上研究生院，你必须参加这个考试并通过，基本上。

59
Well, there's no pass-fail, but certain schools will say that a score is high enough, and other schools will say that a higher score is more important.
嗯，没有通过或不通过，但某些学校会说分数足够高，而其他学校会说更高的分数更重要。

60
So, you can maybe go to a better school if you have a better score.
所以，如果你有更好的分数，可能可以去更好的学校。

61
Okay, and well, Mindy went on to explain the three parts of this test.
好的，Mindy接着解释了这个考试的三个部分。

62
The first one she said is analytical writing.
她说的第一个是分析写作。

63
Alright, so analytical writing is a very common part of a test.
好的，分析写作是考试中非常常见的一部分。

64
For example, I think the SAT also has analytical writing, and basically you're asked to read something and then write about it.
例如，我认为SAT也有分析写作，基本上你被要求阅读一些内容，然后写关于它的东西。

65
And analytical means that you have to really use your mind to make an argument.
而分析意味着你必须真正用你的头脑来进行论证。

66
It's not just read and repeat, read and repeat.
这不仅仅是阅读和重复，阅读和重复。

67
Right, so it basically comes from analyzing.
对，所以它基本上来自于分析。

68
You analyze what you read, and then you write about it.
你分析你所阅读的内容，然后写出它。

69
That's right, you have to think, and you have to understand what you read, and then you have to write something that makes sense.
没错，你必须思考，理解你所阅读的内容，然后写出有意义的东西。

70
It's logical.
这是合乎逻辑的。

71
Do you put your opinion in analytical writing?
你在分析写作中加入你的观点吗？

72
No.
不。

73
No, so it's all based on facts.
不，所以这完全基于事实。

74
Based on facts and logic and argument.
基于事实、逻辑和论证。

75
Okay, so you have this part of analytical writing, and then Mindy talks about the quantitative section of the test.
好的，所以你有这个分析写作部分，然后Mindy谈到了考试的定量部分。

76
So, what is this?
那么，这是什么？

77
So, the quantitative section, you think of the word quantify, quantity, quantitative, has to do with numbers.
所以，定量部分，你想到的词是量化、数量、定量，和数字有关。

78
Math, basically.
基本上是数学。

79
So, you have to be able to understand basic math, some algebra, some arithmetic, some statistics, for example.
所以，你必须能够理解基本的数学，一些代数，一些算术，一些统计，例如。

80
So, quantitative sections on tests are the math sections.
所以，考试中的定量部分就是数学部分。

81
Now, from my understanding, even though it is a math section, it's not really like they give you a problem, an equation, and you have to solve it.
根据我的理解，尽管这是数学部分，但并不是说他们给你一个问题，一个方程式，你必须解决它。

82
It's more like analysis, right?
更像是分析，对吧？

83
They give you some information, and you have to use math to solve it.
他们给你一些信息，你必须用数学来解决它。

84
That's right.
没错。

85
So, there are a number of different parts.
所以，有许多不同的部分。

86
One of them is like what you say.
其中一个就像你说的。

87
It's about logic while using algebra to solve these problems.
这是关于逻辑，同时使用代数来解决这些问题。

88
I think the other part of it has to do with statistics and being able to understand trends, graphs, things like that.
我认为它的另一部分与统计有关，能够理解趋势、图表等。

89
So, this is the math section of the exam.
所以，这就是考试的数学部分。

90
So, not only do you have to be able to read, understand, and analyze what you're reading, you have to be able to be good at math.
所以，你不仅要能够阅读、理解和分析你所阅读的内容，还必须擅长数学。

91
And then finally, we have a verbal section.
然后最后，我们有一个语言部分。

92
What is this all about?
这是什么？

93
This is about your English language and grammar skills.
这是关于你的英语语言和语法技能。

94
And so, the verbal section will test your vocabulary knowledge.
所以，语言部分将测试你的词汇知识。

95
Do you understand what big words mean?
你理解大词的意思吗？

96
Also, will test your ability to read passages and analyze them.
还将测试你阅读段落并分析它们的能力。

97
So, I guess this part is one of the most important parts for foreign students who obviously don't speak English as their first language.
所以，我想这一部分对那些显然不是以英语为母语的外国学生来说是最重要的部分之一。

98
This makes sure that you have a good enough English level to be able to take a graduate program in English, right?
这确保你有足够好的英语水平，能够参加英语的研究生项目，对吧？

99
Part of it is that there's a special test that will test your English abilities, but this is absolutely an important part for a non-native English speaker on the GMAT.
其中一部分是有一个特殊的测试来测试你的英语能力，但这绝对是非母语英语使用者在GMAT中一个重要的部分。

100
It's hard for English speakers who were born speaking English, even native English speakers.
对于那些以英语为母语的人，甚至是母语英语使用者来说，这也很难。

101
So, it's something that really you should devote your time to if you are a non-native English speaker, because there will be some very challenging words there.
所以，如果你是非母语英语使用者，这确实是你应该花时间去做的事情，因为那里会有一些非常具有挑战性的单词。

102
Okay, so those are the three sections of the GMAT.
好吧，这就是GMAT的三个部分。

103
And so, to finish off language takeaway, Ash said that he's going to take this test because he wants to become a corporate fat cat.
所以，为了结束语言收获，Ash说他要参加这个测试，因为他想成为一个企业富翁。

104
All right, now this is an interesting term.
好吧，这个词很有趣。

105
This is not something we talk about in the office.
这是我们在办公室里不谈论的事情。

106
This is something we talk about with friends.
这是我们和朋友谈论的事情。

107
So, corporate fat cat.
所以，企业富翁。

108
You think corporate corporation has to do with business.
你认为企业和商业有关。

109
So basically, we're talking about very important businessmen.
所以基本上，我们在谈论非常重要的商人。

110
But fat cat's not a good thing, right?
但富翁并不是好事，对吧？

111
No, it's not really.
不，确实不是。

112
You refer to a fat cat, a corporate fat cat, as a businessman who you consider to have a lot of money, but obviously, you make the analogy that they're fat because they have so much money.
你提到富翁，企业富翁，是指你认为有很多钱的商人，但显然，你在比喻他们因为有很多钱而变得肥胖。

113
And it's kind of a way of saying that businessmen are not the... corporate fat cats are not the best people around.
这有点像在说商人并不是……企业富翁并不是最优秀的人。

114
No, you're basically saying that these guys, these men on top, they're rich, but they're kind of lazy.
不，你基本上是在说这些人，这些高层，他们很富有，但有点懒惰。

115
And so he wants to be a corporate fat cat.
所以他想成为一个企业富翁。

116
He wants to be very rich and powerful and not have to work so hard.
他想非常富有和有权势，而不必那么努力工作。

117
Which obviously is not really the case always.
这显然并不总是如此。

118
But this is a common term that, as you said, you wouldn't really mention it in the office, but it's more of a satirical way of speaking about businessmen.
但这是一个常见的术语，正如你所说的，你不会在办公室提到它，但这更像是对商人的讽刺性说法。

119
All right, so now let's finish off language takeaway and move to some phrases on Fluency Builder.
好吧，现在让我们结束语言收获，转到流利度提升的一些短语。
