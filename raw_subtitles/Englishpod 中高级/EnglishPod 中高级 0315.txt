40
The first one that I wanted to discuss, Marco, is formal.

41
Formal, that's right.

42
We want to be a little bit more formal when we're writing someone we don't really know too much.
当我们写给不太熟悉的人时，我们想要稍微正式一些。

43
That's right.
没错。

44
But we have to be careful because sometimes you can be too formal.
但我们必须小心，因为有时你可能会太正式。

45
So what exactly does formal mean?
那么，正式到底是什么意思？

46
So if you write a formal email, it's very proper, very respectful.
如果你写一封正式的电子邮件，那是非常得体和尊重的。

47
So proper in the way that you wouldn't use colloquial terms or phrasal verbs that you would use with your friends.
所以得体的方式是你不会使用口语或与朋友交流时使用的短语动词。

48
No, a good example is writing to a lawyer or a judge.

49
You want to use formal language.

50
Even with a teacher, you might use more formal language.

52
That's something else.
那是另外一回事。

53
That's right.

So when you're writing something that's formal, it's important to be polite as well.
所以当你写正式的东西时，礼貌也很重要。

55
Now, what is polite?
现在，什么是礼貌？

56
Right.

58
You want to show respect.

所以人们常常被描述为礼貌。

62
He's very polite or she's not polite at all.

63
Right.

65
Always say thank you and you're welcome when you're talking to other people.

66
That's right.

67
And that's one way of being polite.

68
Now, also, when we are describing the way that you speak to someone or the way that you write, you can be very direct.
现在，当我们描述你与某人交谈或写作的方式时，你可以非常直接。

69
Now, being direct means that you say exactly what you want or exactly what you're thinking.
现在，直接意味着你说出你想要的或你在想的确切内容。

70
Okay, so maybe if we're talking to this company, you say, hi, I want this, I will pay this much, thank you, bye.
好吧，所以也许如果我们在和这家公司交谈，你会说，嗨，我想要这个，我会支付这个价钱，谢谢，再见。

71
Right.
对。

72
That's maybe too direct.
这可能太直接了。

73
So sometimes you need to be a little less direct and say nice things in an email.
所以有时你需要稍微少一点直接，在电子邮件中说一些好听的话。

74
So maybe you want to say to someone that you don't really like the clothes they're wearing.
所以也许你想对某人说你不太喜欢他们穿的衣服。

75
You say, hey, do you like my new shirt?
你会说，嘿，你喜欢我这件新衬衫吗？

81
Or I think a different color would be better on you.
或者我觉得换个颜色会更适合你。

82
That's right.

So that's being a little bit less direct.
所以这就是稍微少一点直接。

84
Now, obviously, if you're too direct with someone, you may offend that person.
现在，显然，如果你对某人太直接，你可能会冒犯那个人。

85
All right.
好的。

86
To offend is a verb.
冒犯是一个动词。

87
And to offend someone means to say something that makes them unhappy or upset or even angry.
冒犯某人意味着说一些让他们不高兴、沮丧甚至生气的话。

88
So going back to the same example of the shirt, if you say, I think that shirt is very ugly, that person might be offended.
所以回到同样的衬衫例子，如果你说，我觉得那件衬衫很丑，那个人可能会感到被冒犯。

89
Gosh.
哇。

90
Or maybe if you say, you know, I think people with brown hair are so ugly.

I'm not ugly, but I have brown hair.
我并不丑，但我有棕色头发。

95
That's right.
没错。

96

So you don't want to offend anyone by being too direct or you don't want to have anyone feel offended.
所以你不想通过太直接而冒犯任何人，或者你不想让任何人感到被冒犯。

So talking about ending formal emails or emails that you're writing to clients, colleagues, we can say sincerely in your name.
所以谈到结束正式邮件或写给客户、同事的邮件时，我们可以说“诚挚的”加上你的名字。

264
Sincerely, Marco.
诚挚的，Marco。

265
You can say all the best, best regards.
你可以说“祝一切顺利”、“最好的问候”。

266
Now I've noticed that some people who aren't native English speakers, sometimes they will close a letter, maybe even a formal letter, saying Yours truly, Marco, for example.
现在我注意到一些非英语母语的人，有时他们会在信的结尾，甚至是正式信中说“您诚挚的”，例如Marco。

267
Is that really appropriate for a business setting or a client?
这在商业环境或客户中真的合适吗？

268
I would not use Yours truly.
我不会使用“您诚挚的”。

269
Maybe if you're trying to build a relationship with your client and you're very honest, but it seems to me to be very personal.
也许如果你想与客户建立关系并且非常诚实，但在我看来这显得非常个人化。

270
Very romantic.
非常浪漫。

271
Yes, Yours truly.
是的，“您诚挚的”。

272
So I would say in that case, Use sincerely or Kind regards or regards, which are a little bit more professional and less emotional.
所以我会说在这种情况下，使用“诚挚的”或“亲切的问候”或“问候”，这些更专业且不那么情感化。

273
If you want to have a romantic letter, you can say, you know, All my love or love or Yours truly or Yours faithfully.
如果你想写一封浪漫的信，你可以说，您知道的，“我所有的爱”或“爱”或“您诚挚的”或“您忠实的”。

274
This is a very important topic, I think, because many times in school we do learn how to write letters, but usually they are more personal letters.
我认为这是一个非常重要的话题，因为很多时候在学校我们确实学习如何写信，但通常它们是更个人的信件。

275
And so we memorize that usually at the end of the email or the end of the letter, you say Yours Marco or Yours truly Marco.
所以我们通常记住在邮件或信的结尾，你说“您忠实的Marco”或“您诚挚的Marco”。

276
And although it is correct, it's not really appropriate for a professional setting.
尽管这是正确的，但在专业环境中并不真正合适。

277
That's right.
没错。

278
So just as a reminder, if you're signing off your email or your letter and you're at an office, you're in your company, you want to say best or best regards or some of the things that we talked about here today.
所以作为提醒，如果你在办公室或公司签署你的邮件或信件，你想说“最好的”或“最好的问候”或我们今天讨论的一些内容。

279
Very good.
非常好。

280
All right.
好的。

281
