Hello, everyone.
大家好。

2
Welcome back to EnglishPod.
欢迎回到EnglishPod。

3
My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

4
And my name is Katherine.
我叫Katherine。

5
So today we've got a great upper intermediate level lesson for our learners, and we're talking about what?
今天我们为学习者准备了一节很棒的中高级课程，我们要讨论什么？

6
Healthcare.
医疗保健。

7
Okay, this is a very important topic because it's been in the news recently, especially in the context of American politics.
好的，这是一个非常重要的话题，因为最近它在新闻中频繁出现，尤其是在美国政治的背景下。

8
And so I don't know if you've heard things about this, listeners, but healthcare is a very hot topic.
所以我不知道你们听说过什么，听众们，但医疗保健是一个非常热门的话题。

9
Exactly.
确实如此。

10
So basically what we're talking about is health insurance, whether it's private health insurance or you know, like a standard national insurance program.
我们讨论的基本上是健康保险，无论是私人健康保险还是像标准的国家保险计划。

11
Exactly.
确实如此。

12
And so your country might have a private option where you can pay a private company for insurance or public option like England or Australia, where your country will actually provide healthcare for you at no extra cost.
所以你的国家可能有一个私人选项，你可以为保险支付私人公司，或者像英格兰或澳大利亚那样的公共选项，你的国家实际上会为你提供医疗保健而不收取额外费用。

13
Very good.
非常好。

14
So it's an interesting topic.
这是一个有趣的话题。

15
Why don't we jump directly into the dialogue and we'll be back to explain a couple of things.
我们为什么不直接进入对话，稍后再回来解释一些事情。

16
Hey, honey, how was your day?
嘿，亲爱的，你今天过得怎么样？

17
It was all right.
还不错。

18
I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.
我遇到了Bill，我们聊了一会儿。

19
He's in a bit of a jam.
他遇到了一点麻烦。

20
Why?
为什么？

21
What happened?
发生了什么？

22
Well, his son had an accident.
嗯，他的儿子出了事故。

23
Bill doesn't have health insurance.
Bill没有健康保险。

24
This really got me thinking.
这让我真的在思考。

25
And I wondered if we shouldn't look into a couple of different HMOs.
我在想我们是否应该考虑几种不同的HMO。

26
Yeah, you're right.
是的，你说得对。

27
We aren't getting any younger and our kids are getting older.
我们不再年轻了，孩子们也在长大。

28
Exactly.
确实如此。

29
I searched on the web and found a couple of HMOs with low co-pays and good coverage.
我在网上搜索了一下，找到了几种低共付额和良好覆盖的HMO。

30
The deductibles are low too.
免赔额也很低。

31
Sounds good.
听起来不错。

32
Although, do you think we can qualify for insurance?
不过，你觉得我们能申请到保险吗？

33
Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money.
那些保险公司在钱方面真是海盗。

34
Well, we don't have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions, so we should be fine.
嗯，我们没有任何既往疾病或状况，所以应该没问题。

35
I wish our company or country provided us with health care.
我希望我们的公司或国家能为我们提供医疗保健。

36
Not in a million years.
一百万年也不可能。

37
All right, we're back.
好吧，我们回来了。

38
So a lot of interesting vocab here.
这里有很多有趣的词汇。

39
Why don't we take a look at it real fast in language takeaway.
我们为什么不快速看一下语言要点。

40
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

41
Okay, Marco, this first phrase or acronym actually is three words that go together, HMO, and they're very, very common when you're talking about health care.
好的，Marco，这第一个短语或缩写实际上是三个词组合在一起，HMO，它们在谈论医疗保健时非常常见。

42
Right, so an HMO means Health Maintenance Organization.
对，所以HMO是健康维护组织的意思。

43
Okay, and so this is a part of the health insurance topic where we're talking about a company that will provide health insurance.
好的，这就是我们讨论健康保险时提到的一家公司，它会提供健康保险。

44
Right, so it's a company that provides health insurance basically.
对，所以它基本上是一家提供健康保险的公司。

45
And if you go up to an HMO, some of the information that you'll receive is, for example, what your co-pay will be.
如果你去找HMO，你会收到一些信息，例如，你的共付额是多少。

46
Okay, so sometimes with a private option, when you pay a company to give you health insurance, you can get a lower rate if you help pay for some of your care.
好的，所以有时在私人选项中，当你支付公司给你健康保险时，如果你帮助支付一些护理费用，你可以获得更低的费率。

47
So, for example, a co-pay on a broken arm might be $20, but you pay $20, that's your co-pay, and your health insurance company pays the rest.
例如，骨折的共付额可能是20美元，但你支付20美元，那就是你的共付额，而你的健康保险公司支付其余部分。

48
And so sometimes co-pays are really high, they're really big, and that's kind of a bad deal because if you hurt yourself, you don't want to pay a lot.
所以有时共付额真的很高，真的很大，这种情况就不好了，因为如果你受伤了，你不想支付很多。

49
Right.
对。

50
But sometimes there's no co-pay, in which case your company will pay for all of the coverage.
但有时没有共付额，在这种情况下，你的公司会支付所有的覆盖费用。

51
Alright, so another very similar word is a deductible.
好的，另一个非常相似的词是免赔额。

52
Okay, so deductible is something that is fixed and it's in your insurance policy.
好的，免赔额是固定的，它在你的保险政策中。

53
That means in the contract that you make with the insurance company, the deductible will be stated.
这意味着在你与保险公司签订的合同中，免赔额会被说明。

54
For example, my insurance plan, I have maybe a $500 deductible.
例如，我的保险计划中，我可能有500美元的免赔额。

55
That means that in any situation I get hurt or I get sick, I pay for the first $500 of care and then my insurance company pays for the rest.
这意味着在任何情况下我受伤或生病，我支付前500美元的护理费用，然后我的保险公司支付其余部分。

56
Right.
对。

57
So if I have to have a thousand dollar surgery, I pay $500 and then my insurance company pays the other $500.
所以如果我需要进行一千美元的手术，我支付500美元，然后我的保险公司支付另外500美元。

58
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

59
And well, you have these deductibles and everything and that depends on your coverage, right?
你有这些免赔额和一切，这取决于你的覆盖范围，对吧？

60
So coverage, how much the HMO covers you.
所以覆盖范围，就是HMO为你提供的保障。

61
That's right, and so you can find this also in your contract with your insurance company and coverage will include or not include something.
没错，所以你也可以在与保险公司的合同中找到这一点，覆盖范围将包括或不包括某些内容。

62
So coverage, for example, in a health care plan does not usually include your teeth.
所以例如，医疗保健计划中的覆盖范围通常不包括你的牙齿。

63
That's a separate kind of insurance.
那是另一种保险。

64
Right.
对。

65
But a coverage can include emergency evacuation from a situation or ambulances, for example.
但覆盖范围可以包括紧急撤离或救护车，例如。

66
And so coverage is what is included in your insurance plan.
所以覆盖范围就是你保险计划中包含的内容。

67
Okay, is to qualify for.
好的，资格。

68
All right, so you might have heard this phrase before in the context of sports or academics.
好的，你可能在体育或学术的背景下听过这个短语。

69
So he qualified for a scholarship or she qualified for the varsity volleyball team.
所以他获得了奖学金，或者她获得了校队排球队的资格。

70
But in this case to qualify for is to be able to use.
但在这种情况下，资格是能够使用。

71
To be eligible for.
有资格。

72
So sometimes HMOs like in, for example, the United States will not accept a person who has maybe some health problems already because that would be too much of a risk right for the company.
所以有时HMO，比如在美国，可能不会接受已经有一些健康问题的人，因为这对公司来说风险太大。

73
All right.
好吧。

74
That's right.
没错。

75
Or you could qualify for a reduced rate because you have a very good health history.
或者你可能因为有很好的健康记录而获得降低的费率。

76
Okay, so this is very interesting and we have a couple of other phrases that are very related to this language.
好的，这非常有趣，我们还有几个与此语言相关的短语。

77
So why don't we move on now to fluency builder.
所以我们现在为什么不继续进行流利度提升。

78
Fluency builder.
流利度提升。

79
All right, so in fluency builder today, let's take a look at our first phrase.
好的，在今天的流利度提升中，让我们看看我们的第一个短语。

80
We got to talking for a while.
我们聊了一会儿。

81
Okay, we could say, for example, we started talking or we were talking for a while.
好的，我们可以说，例如，我们开始聊天，或者我们聊了一会儿。

82
But this is a very spoken language kind of phrase where we'd say we got to talking.
但这是一个非常口语化的短语，我们会说我们聊了起来。

83
Right.
对。

84
So it's not really grammatically correct.
所以这并不是严格的语法正确。

85
But because you would say we started talking, but sometimes people say we got to talking.
但因为你会说我们开始聊天，但有时人们会说我们聊了起来。

86
So we got into a conversation, right?
所以我们进入了一个对话，对吧？

87
That's right.
没错。

88
And usually it's about something.
通常是关于某事。

89
So we could say, yeah, we got to talking about how we both went to the same high school, or we got to talking about this movie that we both saw.
所以我们可以说，是的，我们聊了起来，谈论我们都上过同一所高中，或者我们聊了起来，谈论我们都看过的这部电影。

90
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

91
And well, they got to talking for a while.
而且，他们聊了一会儿。

92
And apparently his friend was in a bit of a jam.
显然他的朋友遇到了一点麻烦。

93
Okay, jam is a food, you can eat it, you put it on bread, like marmalade, right?
好的，麻烦是食物，你可以吃它，你把它放在面包上，就像果酱，对吧？

94
Exactly.
确实如此。

95
But in this case, a jam is a fix or a difficult situation.
但在这种情况下，麻烦是指困境或困难的情况。

96
So it has a very different meaning.
所以它有非常不同的含义。

97
And I want to warn you about that first, but to be in a jam or to be in a bit of a jam is to be stuck.
我想先提醒你这一点，但处于麻烦中或有点麻烦是指被困住。

98
Okay, so you're in a difficult situation, you have some problem.
好的，所以你处于困难的境地，有一些问题。

99
Yeah.
是的。

100
So Marco, I'm in a bit of a jam here.
所以Marco，我有点麻烦。

101
Can I get your help with something?
我可以请你帮忙吗？

102
All right, very good.
好的，非常好。

103
Okay, and then the guy was talking about insurance.
好吧，然后那个人在谈论保险。

104
And he said, this really got me thinking.
他说，这让我开始思考。

105
So we got the verb got again there.
所以我们又有了动词“got”。

106
All right, so got me thinking.
好吧，所以“got me thinking”。

107
That means I started thinking about something.
这意味着我开始思考某事。

108
So you know, when we were talking about jam a minute ago, it got me thinking about how much I love breakfast.
所以你知道，当我们刚才谈论果酱时，这让我想到了我有多爱早餐。

109
Very good.

110
So you would use it in that way, right?
所以你会那样使用它，对吧？

111
Like it reminded me, it reminded me or I started to really think about something.
就像它让我想起了，我开始真正思考某事。

112
Okay.
好的。

113
And our last phrase is a pre existing illness.
我们最后一个短语是“既往疾病”。

114
All right, so to exist is to be you know, to be around.
好吧，存在就是存在，你知道的。

115
pre existing means existing before something else.
“既往”意味着在其他事情之前存在。

116
Okay.
好的。

117
And so you often hear this in terms of insurance, when someone asks you about your pre existing condition.
所以你经常在保险方面听到这个，当有人问你关于你的既往病症时。

118
So that means if I'm signing up for an insurance plan, health insurance plan, and I have an interview with you, Marco, and you asked me this question.
这意味着如果我在注册一个健康保险计划时，和你，Marco，进行面谈，你问我这个问题。

119

120
That means what diseases or health problems do I have now right now, right prior to signing up for this insurance?
这意味着我现在有什么疾病或健康问题，正好是在注册这个保险之前？

121
And I say, Oh, I don't have any and you're very happy because that means I'll be cheap.
我说，哦，我没有任何问题，你很高兴，因为这意味着我会便宜。

122
But um, if I say Oh, I have diabetes, then that is something that the insurance companies don't like because it's expensive.
但是，如果我说，哦，我有糖尿病，那么保险公司就不喜欢，因为这很贵。

123
Right?
对吧？

124
Because you're more probable of getting sick or something like that.
因为你更可能生病或类似的事情。

125
Right.
