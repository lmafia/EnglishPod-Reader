6
The last will and testament of someone.

7
Alright, so what is a will and testament?

8
Well basically this is a document that someone writes.

Usually with a lawyer that explains what to do with the person's body and their possessions, their things after they die.
通常是和律师一起写的，说明在他去世后，如何处理他的身体和财产。

10
Right.

11
So many people write these and the family will then use it to discover who gets to receive certain objects and what to do with this person's body.
很多人会写这些，家人会用它来确定谁可以继承某些物品，以及如何处理这个人的身体。

12
Right.

正是如此。

14
So that is a last will and testament.
这就是最后的遗嘱和遗产。

15
We are going to take a look at an example of one.

16
So you would see more or less in English how one is written.
这样你就能大致了解英文中是如何写的。

17
Now obviously they can be very long and very complex.
显然，它们可以非常长且复杂。

18
So we've taken one that has some interesting words there that are a little bit more specific.

If my spouse, Betty Thompson, does not survive me, I give all the rest and residue of my estate to English Pod.
如果我的配偶贝蒂·汤普森未能存活，我将我所有的遗产和剩余财产留给English Pod。

24
If neither Betty Thompson nor English Pod survives me, I give all the rest and residue of my estate to my heirs as determined by the laws of the state of California relating to descent and distribution.
如果贝蒂·汤普森和English Pod都未能存活，我将我所有的遗产和剩余财产留给我的继承人，按照加利福尼亚州关于继承和分配的法律来确定。

37
So he says, I am in sound mind.

38
And sound is an adjective to describe I am in a good state of mind.
而清醒是用来描述我处于良好的精神状态。

39
That's right.
没错。

40
So it means not having any problems or logical or unaffected.

41

It will work.
它会有效。

57
So you can use this adjective with sound body, sound mind, or a sound decision.

64
Moving on, he was talking about the will and he says, I hereby revoke all previous wills and codicils.
接下来，他谈到了遗嘱，他说，我在此撤销所有以前的遗嘱和附录。

65
The verb here is to revoke.
这里的动词是撤销。

66
To revoke.
撤销。

67
This is something that a lot of people hear in America when they drive their car too fast.
这是很多人在美国开车太快时听到的事情。

68
Yeah.
是的。

69
The police catch them and the police revoke their driver's license.
警察抓住他们，警察撤销他们的驾驶执照。

70
And that basically means to take away.

71
That's right.
没错。

72
Yeah, to take, right?
是的，取消，对吧？

73
To take away from.

74
So this man here, Luke Thompson, what he's saying is, I revoke all previous wills.
所以这个人，卢克·汤普森，他所说的是，我撤销所有以前的遗嘱。

75
That means any other will that I wrote before, it's not good anymore.

76
Right.
对。

77
I'm throwing it away.
我把它扔掉。

78
This is the only one that will exist.
这是唯一有效的遗嘱。

79
So you can use this word revoke with many aspects.
所以你可以在很多方面使用这个词撤销。

80
For example, sometimes employees will get their benefits revoked by the company because maybe they don't have enough money anymore.

84
Alright, so to revoke.

85
Now moving on, he was talking about his estate.
现在继续，他谈到了他的遗产。

86
So this is very interesting because he says, I give all the rest and residue of my estate to my spouse.
这很有趣，因为他说，我将我所有的遗产和剩余财产留给我的配偶。

87
Okay, estate, it sounds like a very fancy word.
好吧，遗产，听起来是个很高档的词。

88
It is a fancy word.
确实是个高档词。

89
Sometimes we use this word to mean someone's property, their house.
有时我们用这个词来指某人的财产，他们的房子。

90
But in a will, this means everything the person owns, house, car, things, pets, stocks, investments.
但在遗嘱中，这意味着一个人拥有的所有东西，房子、车、物品、宠物、股票、投资。

91
The estate is essentially everything the person owns as a kind of one unit.
遗产本质上是一个人拥有的所有东西，作为一个整体。

92
Right, exactly.
对，正是如此。

93
So anything that is yours or you may have bought, just consider the estate is a big bag, right?
所以任何属于你或你可能购买的东西，考虑遗产就是一个大袋子，对吧？

94
That's your estate.
那就是你的遗产。

95
And inside this bag is everything that you own.
这个袋子里装着你拥有的一切。

96
You might see advertisements, in fact, in America or in England for estate sales.
你可能会在美国或英国看到关于遗产销售的广告。

97
This means that when someone passes away when they die, their family will sell their things and this is an estate sale.
这意味着当某人去世时，他们的家人会出售他们的物品，这就是遗产销售。

98
You can find beautiful, interesting things in estate sales.
你可以在遗产销售中找到美丽、有趣的东西。

99
Exactly.
确实如此。

100
Very interesting.
非常有趣。

101
So that is a person's estate.
所以这是一个人的遗产。

102
Now remember this is in the legal terms because you also have other things like real estate, as you mentioned, which would be a house, right?
现在记住这是法律术语，因为你还有其他东西，比如你提到的不动产，就是房子，对吧？

103
Okay, now apart from his estate, he was telling everyone as to how they should take care of his body or what they should do with it.
好的，除了他的遗产，他还告诉每个人应该如何照顾他的身体或该怎么处理。

104
And he said, well, I am to be cremated.
他表示，我要火化。

105
Okay, this is important.
好的，这很重要。

106
When a person dies, there are generally two options.
当一个人去世时，通常有两个选择。

107
Their body can be buried in a casket in the ground.
他们的身体可以埋在地下的棺材里。

108
That means they're put in the earth, but a lot of people choose to be cremated.
这意味着他们被放在土里，但很多人选择火化。

109
Alright.
好的。

110
That means that their body will be burned and their ashes, that means the things that are left after they are burned, they will be taken somewhere else.
这意味着他们的身体会被烧掉，剩下的灰烬，也就是烧掉后留下的东西，会被带到其他地方。

111
Right.
对。

112
Like in a bowl or a pot.
比如在一个碗或一个罐子里。

113
Right.
对。

114
And in this case, that's what the person wants.
在这种情况下，这就是这个人想要的。

115
He wants to be cremated.
他想要火化。

116
So that would be the verb to cremate and the noun would be a cremation.
所以动词是火化，名词是火葬。

117
Cremation.
火葬。

118
And what is going to happen to all this stuff?
那么这些东西会发生什么呢？

119
Basically, it's going to be given away to his wife, to English pot, and to his heirs.
基本上，它们会被赠予他的妻子、英格兰的陶器和他的继承人。

120
This is our next word.
这是我们的下一个词。

121
What is an heir?
继承人是什么？

122
Now, if you notice, the H is silent there, so his heirs.
现在，如果你注意到，H是静音的，所以是他的继承人。

123
And those are basically his children, his daughters or his sons.
他们基本上是他的孩子，他的女儿或儿子。

124
Right.
对。

125
My heirs are the people who are related to me, who in this case will receive some of my things.
我的继承人是与我有关系的人，在这种情况下将会收到我的一些东西。

126
Now, is it only the children or also it could be maybe any other relatives?
现在，只有孩子吗，还是也可能是其他亲属？

127
It could be any other relative.
可能是其他亲属。

128
You could say, I'm his heir, he's my great uncle.
你可以说，我是他的继承人，他是我的曾叔叔。

129
It means we're related, but we're not necessarily father and daughter or grandfather and granddaughter.
这意味着我们有关系，但不一定是父女或祖孙关系。

130
An heir is someone who is related to the family.
继承人是与家庭有关系的人。

131
It doesn't have to be a certain relationship.
不一定要有特定的关系。

132
And now it's interesting because from this word we can get inheritance.
现在有趣的是，从这个词我们可以得到遗产。

133
Now, we didn't find it in the dialogue.
现在，我们在对话中没有找到它。

134
So it's very interesting because it comes, they're very similar in spelling, right?
所以这很有趣，因为它们在拼写上非常相似，对吧？

135
Inheritance and heir.

136
Right.
对。

137
Good to remember.
记住这点很好。

138
Yeah, good to remember.

139
You switch the E and the I's, right?

140
That's right.

所以遗产是一种东西。

142

143
So I received an inheritance from my great grandmother.

145

148
He was the heir to a great fortune.

149
Okay, interesting.

150
So again, inheritance wasn't in the dialogue, but I think it's worth mentioning.
所以再次强调，遗产没有出现在对话中，但我认为值得一提。

151
And I think now we can move on to four very interesting items that we have for you on Fluency Builder.
我认为现在我们可以继续讨论四个非常有趣的项目，这些项目我们为你准备了流利度提升。

152
Okay, these first two are words that we normally read or hear in legal documents.

So in the Will and Testament, we hear Luke Thompson who says, I herewith affix my signature.
所以在遗嘱和遗嘱中，我们听到卢克·汤普森说，我特此附上我的签名。

169
That means with the action of signing my name, signing my signature, this will be completed.
这意味着通过签署我的名字，签署我的签名，这将会完成。

所以我特此，你必须有一个动作，而不仅仅是一个词。

210
Think about some of the words that we've just discussed and we'll be back in a moment.
想想我们刚讨论的一些词，我们马上回来。

218
So this is a very interesting topic.

219
Now I wonder, within the will or within the estate, do you also acquire a person's debts?
现在我想知道，在遗嘱或遗产中，你是否也会继承一个人的债务？

220
Ah, that's a good question.
啊，这是个好问题。

221
I think you used to.
我想你以前是会的。

222
Because I know in some countries you do, in some countries you don't.
因为我知道在一些国家你会，在一些国家你不会。

223
I know in some cases some heirs have found themselves in some legal problems because all of a sudden they inherited that person's debts.
我知道在某些情况下，一些继承人发现自己陷入法律问题，因为他们突然继承了那个人的债务。

224
I think that does happen, especially for people whose properties are mortgaged.
我认为这种情况确实发生，尤其是对于那些房产有抵押的人。

225
For example, if your uncle has a house and he didn't pay for it with cash, he has a mortgage, and he dies, and you inherit this house, you also inherit the mortgage.
例如，如果你的叔叔有一栋房子，他没有用现金支付，而是有抵押贷款，他去世了，你继承了这栋房子，你也继承了抵押贷款。

226
So sometimes inheritances are not always a good thing.
所以有时候继承并不总是好事。

227
I think this happened more in the past.
我认为这种情况在过去更常见。

228
There are more protections and safeguards for people today.

229
What is it like in Ecuador?
在厄瓜多尔情况如何？

230
Do people inherit debt?
人们会继承债务吗？

231
Well, obviously most banks, when they give out loans or a mortgage, they have somebody that will kind of co-sign on these things.
嗯，显然大多数银行在发放贷款或抵押贷款时，会有某人共同签署这些东西。

232
And I imagine, I'm not really very sure, but I know that if you inherit in a state that has a mortgage, you are forced to pay it.
我想，我不太确定，但我知道如果你继承了有抵押贷款的遗产，你是被迫支付的。

233
And if you can't, then they will make that other person who co-signed it responsible if he still exists.
如果你不能支付，那么他们会让那个共同签署的人负责，如果他还在的话。

234
I don't know.
我不知道。

235
In these legal systems, it's sometimes very strange because it seems like there would be a lot of gaps.
在这些法律系统中，有时会很奇怪，因为似乎会有很多漏洞。

236
That's right, and everyone wants to protect themselves.
没错，每个人都想保护自己。

237
So we've got the bank that wants to protect itself, it gives a loan, it wants the money back.
所以我们有想保护自己的银行，它发放贷款，想要钱回来。

238
And a person who wants to protect himself from maybe a relative who dies and has debt.
还有一个人想保护自己，免受可能去世的亲属的债务影响。

239
I'm curious to know what our users have to say.
我很好奇我们的用户有什么看法。

240
What is the situation in your country?
你们国家的情况如何？

241
Do most people have a will and testament?
大多数人都有遗嘱和遗嘱吗？

242
What happens with debt?
债务会发生什么？

243
Or what happens if somebody dies and they don't have a will and testament?
或者如果有人去世而没有遗嘱和遗嘱会发生什么？

244
That's a good question too.
这也是个好问题。

245
I don't have an answer for that one.
我没有答案。

246
Alright, so let us know and we'll give you guys some information on that as well.
好吧，让我们知道，我们也会给你们一些信息。

247
EnglishPod.com, we'll see everyone there.
EnglishPod.com，我们在那里见。

248
