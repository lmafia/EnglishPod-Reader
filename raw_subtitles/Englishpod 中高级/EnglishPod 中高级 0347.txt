39
That's the first line of the dialogue.
这是对话的第一句。

40
That's right.
没错。

41
So your arrival card, usually you will get on the airplane before you land, and basically you just have to put your name, your passport number, where you're from, and basic information like this that you must give to the immigration officer.
所以你的入境卡，通常你会在飞机降落前获得，基本上你只需填写你的姓名、护照号码、来自哪里以及必须提供给移民官的基本信息。

That's right, some countries require you to fill out a departure card.

好的，所以有些国家，不是所有国家，但你通常会获得入境卡，这意味着你必须提供你的姓名和基本信息。

46
That's right, so we are at the, we are talking to the immigration officer, and he asks, is this your country of birth or residence?
没错，所以我们在和移民官交谈，他问，这是你的出生国还是居住国？

47
All right, let's break that down.
好的，让我们分解一下。

48
Country of birth.
出生国。

49
So birth, birthday, that makes me think of where I was born.
所以出生，生日，这让我想起我出生的地方。

50
So what country were you born in?
那么你出生在哪个国家？

51
That's another way to ask this question.
这是问这个问题的另一种方式。

52
That's right.
没错。

53
So since we said we are coming from China, the immigration officer wants to know if we are Chinese or if we simply live there.
所以既然我们说我们来自中国，移民官想知道我们是中国人还是只是住在那里。

54
And that's why he says or residence.
这就是他为什么说或居住。

55
So residence, it's a noun, it's a thing.
所以居住，是一个名词，是一个事物。

56
My country of residence is the place where I live.
我的居住国是我居住的地方。

57
So I'm American, but maybe my country of residence is France because I live in France.

58
That's right.
没错。

59
So it's different from your country of birth.
所以这与你的出生国不同。

60
Now moving on, when the immigration officer was asking us about money, we said that we have some traveler's checks and two credit cards.
现在继续，当移民官问我们关于钱时，我们说我们有一些旅行支票和两张信用卡。

61
All right, so credit cards are pretty clear, but what exactly are traveler's checks and how are they different from normal checks?
好的，信用卡很清楚，但旅行支票到底是什么，它们与普通支票有什么不同？

62
So traveler's checks are kind of a convenient way to carry money because you have these little pieces of paper that have a certain amount on them.
所以旅行支票是一种方便携带现金的方式，因为你有这些小纸片，上面有一定的金额。

63
So, for example, $500 each.
例如，每张500美元。

64
And if you lose it, it's not a problem because no one can exchange those checks for cash unless it's you.
如果你丢失它，也没问题，因为除了你，没有人可以将这些支票兑换成现金。

65
All right, so my traveler's check, I buy these from the bank.
好的，所以我的旅行支票，我是从银行购买的。

66
They have my name on them, my passport number on them.
上面有我的名字和护照号码。

67
And to spend them as money, I need to show my passport or proof of identification or proof of identity.
要将它们作为现金使用，我需要出示我的护照或身份证明。

68
So basically, if someone steals my traveler's checks, if I lose my traveler's checks, I don't have to worry because no one else can spend them but me.
所以基本上，如果有人偷了我的旅行支票，或者我丢失了我的旅行支票，我不必担心，因为除了我，没有人可以使用它们。

69
Exactly.
正是如此。

70
They were very, very popular back before credit cards were so popular.
在信用卡流行之前，它们曾经非常受欢迎。

71
Now you don't really see too many traveler's checks, but it's still convenient.
现在你不太会看到旅行支票，但它们仍然很方便。

72
All right, so a lot of language there.
好的，所以有很多语言要点。

So now let's take a look at some of those key questions that the immigration officer asks us on Fluency Builder.
现在让我们看看移民官在流利度提升中问我们的几个关键问题。

100
Fluency Builder.
流利度提升。

101
This first sentence, this first question is actually something that a lot of learners of English have a hard time with.
第一句话，第一个问题实际上是很多英语学习者都很难回答的。

102
Where are you coming from?
你来自哪里？

103
Right.
对。

104
So the immigration officer is sitting there at his desk and you are arriving on an airplane.
所以移民官坐在他的桌子前，而你是乘飞机到达的。

105
So what he wants to know is what country are you arriving from?
他想知道的是你是从哪个国家到达的？

106
So if I am on a flight from France to America, I say I'm arriving from France.
如果我从法国飞往美国，我会说我来自法国。

107
I'm coming from France.
我来自法国。

108
That's right.
没错。

109
But here's a big thing.
但这里有一个大问题。

110
What if he says where are you from?
如果他说你来自哪里？

111
Now he's asking you for your nationality.
现在他在问你的国籍。

112
So then you wouldn't say France because you're not French.
所以你就不能说法国，因为你不是法国人。

113
I'm not French.
我不是法国人。

114
I'm American.
我是美国人。

115
So I say I am American, but I'm coming from France.
所以我说我美国人，但我来自法国。

116
Yes.
是的。

117
So this is a very typical question that English learners confuse because as you can see it's very very similar, but you just have one word that you add on and it completely changes the question.
这是一个非常典型的问题，英语学习者常常混淆，因为如你所见，它们非常相似，但你只需添加一个词，问题就完全改变了。

118
So when the immigration officer asks you where are you coming from you tell them what country you got on the plane.
所以当移民官问你你来自哪里时，你告诉他们你上飞机的国家。

119
Alright, so where did you leave to come to America?
好的，那么你是从哪里出发来到美国的？

120
Did you leave from France, China, Ghana?
你是从法国、中国、加纳出发的吗？

121
So that's the answer to that question.
这就是那个问题的答案。

122
Exactly because most of the time immigration officers will never ask you where you are from because they will see your passport.
正是因为大多数时候移民官不会问你来自哪里，因为他们会看到你的护照。

123
They know they know.
他们知道，他们知道。

124
So okay.
好吧。

125
Now once we give them our passport, we tell them that we just work in China.
现在一旦我们给他们护照，我们告诉他们我们只是工作在中国。

126
We're not Chinese.
我们不是中国人。

127
He asks what is the purpose of your visit to the United States?
他问你来美国的目的是什么？

128
What's the purpose of your visit?
你来访的目的是什么？

129
Now purpose means goal or aim.
现在目的意味着目标或意图。

130
So there are a couple of standard answers to this question, but basically the immigration officer wants to know why are you in America?
所以这个问题有几个标准答案，但基本上移民官想知道你为什么在美国？

131
Why are you coming here?
你为什么来这里？

132
That's right.
没错。

133
So you have, as Catherine says, a couple of different ways of answering that.
所以你有，正如凯瑟琳所说，几种不同的回答方式。

134
We're saying here that we are here on vacation.
我们在这里说我们是来度假的。

135
I'm here on vacation.

136
Tourism.

Seeing family.
看望家人。

141
These are all acceptable answers.
这些都是可以接受的答案。

142
That's right.
没错。

143
So now that we've told the officer all of this information, we actually forgot to fill out our address on our arrival card.
所以现在我们告诉官员所有这些信息，我们实际上忘记在入境卡上填写我们的地址。

144
So he says that we must specify an address.
所以他说我们必须指定一个地址。

145
Alright, so to specify this is a verb.
好的，指定是一个动词。

146
It means to indicate or write down or identify because right now there is no address where we're going to stay.
它的意思是指明、写下或识别，因为现在没有我们要住的地址。

147
So to specify means to basically to tell someone where it is to be exact.
所以指定意味着基本上告诉某人确切的位置。

148
That's right.
没错。

149
So you need to specify an address of where you will be during the time you're in the United States.
所以你需要指定你在美国期间的地址。

150
It could be a hotel, any place.
它可以是一个酒店，任何地方。

151
Right, but it can't be like Chicago.
对，但不能是像芝加哥这样的城市。

152
Right.
对。

153
No, it can't be a city.
不，它不能是一个城市。

154
It's got to be an address.
必须是一个地址。

155
Address.
地址。

156
So 10 South Street, Chicago, Illinois.
所以是南街10号，芝加哥，伊利诺伊州。

157
That's right.
没错。

158
Now we told the immigration officer where we're going to be, and he asks a very important question, also very, very common.
现在我们告诉移民官我们要去的地方，他问了一个非常重要的问题，也非常常见。

159
Do you have enough means to support yourself while you are here?

160
So means in this instance means resources or money.

161
So do you have enough money to pay for your housing, your food?
所以你有足够的钱来支付你的住房、食物吗？

162
That's the question.
这就是问题。

163
So means to support yourself.
所以资金支持自己。

164
That means, can you pay for yourself?
这意味着，你能支付自己的费用吗？

165
Who's paying for this trip?

166
Exactly.
没错。

167
So this is why we say, yeah, we have some traveler's checks and a couple of credit cards.
所以这就是我们说的，是的，我们有一些旅行支票和几张信用卡。

168
And lastly, we also need to answer if we have anything to declare.
最后，我们还需要回答是否有任何需要申报的物品。

169
But what does this mean to declare what?
但这意味着申报什么？

170
To declare at customs.
在海关申报。

171
Okay.
好的。

172
But we don't normally ask to declare at customs.
但我们通常不要求在海关申报。

173
We just say, do you have anything to declare?
我们只是问，你有任何需要申报的物品吗？

174
This is because normally when we travel to other countries, there are special taxes for certain goods.
这是因为通常当我们旅行到其他国家时，某些商品会有特别的税收。

175
For example, if I want to come to America and I have three bottles of wine, I have to give one away because I'm only allowed to bring in two bottles.
例如，如果我想来美国，我带了三瓶酒，我必须放弃一瓶，因为我只能带两瓶。

176
Right.
对。

177
So I have to declare two bottles of wine or money.
所以我必须申报两瓶酒或现金。

178
I'm only allowed to bring $10,000.
我只能带$10,000。

179
If I bring $15,000, I have to write that down and say I have this extra money and then I pay tax.
如果我带$15,000，我必须写下来并说我有这笔额外的钱，然后我支付税。

180
Right.
对。

181
So basically, they will ask you, what are you bringing to America?
所以基本上，他们会问你，你带了什么来美国？

182
And if there are special things like money or things you will sell or alcohol, cigarettes, you have to declare these.
如果有特殊的东西，比如钱或你要出售的东西或酒、香烟，你必须申报这些。

183
You have to explain what you're carrying.
你必须解释你携带的物品。

184
That's right.
没错。

185
So this is a very important question.
所以这是一个非常重要的问题。

186
Also, most of the time, obviously, if you're on tourism, you don't have much to declare.
另外，大多数时候，显然，如果你是旅游，你没有太多需要申报的东西。

187
But maybe like if Catherine says, maybe you are going to buy a house in the United States and you have $20,000 in your luggage, then you need to tell them that.
但也许像凯瑟琳说的，也许你要在美国买房子，而你行李里有$20,000，那你就需要告诉他们。

188
That's right.
没错。

189
So that's called declaring to declare at customs.
所以这叫做在海关申报。

190

Welcome to the United States.

好的，当你到达移民局时，显然这些问题都是非常常见的。

217
You will be asked.
你会被问到。

218
But when you're arriving there, there are actually two different sections that you have to go to, right?

221
Maybe many lines, but they'll have a sign on top.

222
One says U.S.
一条写着美国护照或美国护照持有者，这意味着是美国人回国的队伍。

223
passports or U.S.
但对于大多数来美国旅行的人来说，他们是外国人。

224
passport holders, and that means the line for Americans coming home to America.
他们必须去另一条队伍，也就是非美国护照持有者。

225
But for most people who are traveling to America, they're foreigners.
没错。

226
They have to go to the other line, so that's non-U.S.
现在记住，当你和移民官交谈时，你真的不需要紧张。

227
passport holders.
你知道，只需放轻松，尽量回答问题。

228
That's right.

229
Now remember that you don't really have to get nervous when you're talking to the immigration officer.
没错。

230
You know, just you have to take it easy and just try to answer the questions.
所以没有什么好担心的。

231
Most of them will speak a couple of words in many popular languages, like Chinese or Spanish or Arabic, because obviously some people that go on holiday to the United States, maybe they don't speak English.
这些人是为了确保美国的安全。

232
That's right.
他们想检查行李。

233
So there's nothing to be worried about.
他们想知道谁进入这个国家，他们只是在做他们的工作，基本上是在警戒边界。

234
These people are there to make sure that America is safe.
对。

235
They want to check the bags.
但这很简单。

236
They want to know who's coming into the country, and they're just doing their job being basically policing the borders.
对我来说，海关最烦人的部分就是排队。

237
Right.

238
But it's pretty simple.

239
The most annoying part of customs for me is waiting in line.

240
Yeah, you have so many people arrive at the same time that you can wait in line maybe an hour sometimes.
是的，你会有很多人同时到达，有时你可能要排一个小时的队。

241
Sometimes.
有时是的。

242
So again, just be honest and you know, I think people will try to understand you if you're having a hard time.
所以再次强调，只需诚实，你知道，如果你有困难，我认为人们会尽量理解你。

243
Exactly.
正是如此。
