In the living room, we would have moss green rugs, and a fireplace with a stone mantle and wood paneling on the walls.
在客厅里，我们会有苔藓绿色的地毯，还有一个带石质壁炉和木质墙板的壁炉。

23
In the kitchen, the cupboards would be a pale yellow, and we would have a turquoise metal oven and vinyl flooring.
在厨房，橱柜是淡黄色的，我们会有一个蓝绿色的金属烤箱和乙烯基地板。

24
Um, sweetie, but I was thinking of more modern-style house, an open-concept house or glass, wood, metal, and concrete.
嗯，亲爱的，但我想要更现代风格的房子，开放式设计，或者玻璃、木材、金属和混凝土。

26
Besides, it's just a fad.

28
Sweetie pie, it's not a lot of wasted space.

29
It is relaxing, and the house would be eco-friendly with an in-floor heating system, and designed to retain the heat of the sun in the winter, and keep the house cool in the summer.

32
What about your vintage furniture, dearest?

And instead of a lawn, which is also a lot of wasted space, and would require environmentally harmful pesticides, we would have a fish pond in the backyard, and a garden that would cover the whole yard so we could grow our own food.
而且，后院没有草坪，这也是很多浪费的空间，还需要对环境有害的农药，我们会在后院有一个鱼塘，还有一个覆盖整个院子的花园，这样我们就可以自己种食物。

34
But, Buttercup, I thought you always said that you love visiting your grandmother's house.
但是，黄花菜，我以为你总是说你喜欢去你奶奶的家。

And I thought you, Mr. Scientist, were all up on saving the planet with your technological advancements.

44
Well, that's the beauty of compromise, I think.
嗯，我认为这就是妥协的美。

45
You can go back and forth, but with your loved one or your spouse, you have to make some decisions about what you want and what they want.
你可以来回讨论，但和你所爱的人或配偶，你必须做出一些关于你想要什么和他们想要什么的决定。

46
All you need to do is give a guy his own room in which he can decorate and do whatever he wants with it.
你只需要给一个人一个他可以装饰和随意使用的房间。

47
That's all you need.
这就是你所需要的。

48
No, no, not me, just any guy.

49
You want to decorate the house in any way you want, fine.

50
But just give us one room, you know, like five meters by five meters where we can put anything we want.

56
Anyway, we've got a lot of great words here in Language Takeaways, so let's take a peek at some of those.
不管怎样，我们在语言收获中有很多很棒的词汇，所以让我们来看看其中一些。

57
All right, so the first word that we have, or it's actually a concept, minimal landscaping.
好的，所以我们有的第一个词，实际上是一个概念，最小景观设计。

58
Okay, so minimal is a style, minimal list, actually.
好的，所以最小是一种风格，实际上是最小主义。

59
And minimal landscaping is this kind of style of, well, designing your lawn or your garden.
最小景观设计是一种设计草坪或花园的风格。

60
Okay.
好的。

61
So minimal means not having adornments or decorations.
所以最小意味着没有装饰或装饰物。

62
Okay, so it's kind of like the less is more type thing.
好的，所以这有点像少即是多的概念。

63
Exactly.
正是如此。

64
So minimal architecture could be very simple, lots of clean lines, not much decoration.
所以最小建筑可以非常简单，很多干净的线条，没有太多装饰。

65
It's the opposite of something that's baroque and highly ornamented.
它与华丽和高度装饰的东西相反。

67
I'm into minimal.

好吧，极简主义者。

69
Anyways, we have minimal landscaping, and, well, he's talking about his patio and old-fashioned grill, and he said quaint lawn furniture.
不管怎样，我们有最小景观设计，他在谈论他的露台和老式烤架，他说古雅的草坪家具。

70
Quaint is sometimes, well, it's usually kind of a bad thing.
古雅有时，嗯，通常是个坏事。

71
We say something is quaint in the way of saying that it's cute, but we don't really like it because it's maybe old-fashioned or, you know, kind of old style.
我们说某样东西古雅是说它可爱，但我们并不真的喜欢它，因为它可能是老式的，或者，你知道，有点老派。

72
So, oh, isn't that quaint?
所以，哦，那不是很古雅吗？

73
It's something that people from the city often say about people in the country, at least in America.
这是城市里的人常常对乡村的人说的，至少在美国。

74
So, oh, because, you know, I went to school on the East Coast, and I'm from the Midwest.
所以，哦，因为，你知道，我在东海岸上学，我来自中西部。

75
So people on the East Coast would say, oh, your house is so quaint, you know, small and cute and old-fashioned.
所以东海岸的人会说，哦，你的房子真古雅，你知道，小而可爱而老式。

76
Because they live in a big, fancy New York apartment or whatever.

77
So quaint is usually something that's not the nicest, but... So he's looking for some lawn furniture that's not like plastic or new.
所以古雅通常不是最好的，但……所以他在寻找一些不是塑料或新的草坪家具。

78
It's more like old-fashioned, maybe wood, right?
更像是老式的，也许是木制的，对吧？

79
Right, and kind of traditional and not, yeah, not fancy.
对，传统的，不，嗯，不奢华。

80
It's kind of simple.

81
Now he's also talking about the house, and he wants, well, a two-car port, pastel siding, and a gable roof.
现在他还在谈论房子，他想要，嗯，一个双车车棚，淡色外墙和山墙屋顶。

82
So now we know what a roof is, but what is a gable roof?
所以现在我们知道屋顶是什么，但山墙屋顶是什么？

83
A gable is a thing, right?
山墙是一个东西，对吧？

84
And it's almost like an extension of the roof in certain parts.
它几乎像是屋顶在某些部分的延伸。

85
For example, on a traditional Cape COD-style house, you have windows in the front.
例如，在传统的Cape COD风格的房子上，前面有窗户。

86
They're not a part of the roof.
它们不是屋顶的一部分。

87
They're an extension.

88
They come out.
它们突出。

89
Popping out like eyes.
像眼睛一样突出。

90
Exactly, they're coming out like eyes.
正是如此，它们像眼睛一样突出。

91
And so the roof, obviously you need a roof on top of those windows.
所以屋顶，显然你需要在那些窗户上方有一个屋顶。

92
So that kind of roof, that little extension, that's called a gable.
所以那种屋顶，那小延伸，叫做山墙。

93
And so there's a wonderful book that's famous in American history called The House of Seven Gables.
所以有一本在美国历史上非常著名的书叫《七个山墙的房子》。

94
That means that on this roof of the house, there are seven different parts that come out.
这意味着在这座房子的屋顶上，有七个不同的部分突出。

95
Seven gables, it's very unique.
七个山墙，非常独特。

That's right.

104
There was even a TV show in America years ago called Picket Fences.
多年前在美国甚至有个叫《栅栏》的电视节目。

105
And I think a picket fence is kind of this ideal in American culture about having your own home in the suburbs and having your own space.
我认为，栅栏在美国文化中代表着在郊区拥有自己家的理想，拥有自己的空间。

106
And so around your yard, around your garden, you have this white picket fence.
所以在你的院子、花园周围，你有这道白色栅栏。

107
And so a picket is, I think, the pointed part.
我认为，栅栏是指尖的部分。

108
So a picket fence is thin pieces of wood that stand in the ground and are connected to protect your property from other people coming inside.
所以，栅栏是竖立在地面上的细木条，连接在一起以保护你的财产不被他人进入。

109
Okay.
好的。

110
So that's a white picket fence.
这就是白色栅栏。

111
You'll hear it all the time, usually in movies or in TV shows, they talk about having their own little house with their dog and a white picket fence.

One of my favorite fads of the 1980s were those shirts that would change color if the room temperature changed color.
我最喜欢的1980年代的时尚之一是那些在室温变化时会变色的衬衫。

136
So if you go outside and it's hot, they would become bright pink.
所以如果你出去，天气热，它们会变成亮粉色。

137
But if you're in a cold room, they would go blue and green.
但如果你在一个冷的房间，它们会变成蓝色和绿色。

138
It was really fun, but they're definitely out of fashion.
这真的很有趣，但它们肯定已经过时了。

139
Yeah, I don't think they wear them anymore.

所以几乎就像，例如，现在1940年代和50年代的衣服非常流行。

155
A lot of girls are into this kind of style.

156
So it's called vintage clothing because it's not from today's styles.

158
Or you could even call those big, flowing dresses from the 1970s vintage clothing.

A perfect lawn with minimal landscaping, a brick patio in the backyard with an old-fashioned grill, quaint lawn furniture, and a swimming pool.
完美的草坪，最小的景观设计，后院有一个砖砌露台和一个老式烤架，别致的草坪家具和一个游泳池。

What about your vintage furniture, dearest?

And instead of a lawn, which is also a lot of wasted space and would require environmentally harmful pesticides, we would have a fish pond in the backyard and a garden that would cover the whole yard so we could grow our own food.
而且，代替草坪，这也是很多浪费的空间，还需要对环境有害的杀虫剂，我们会在后院有一个鱼塘和一个覆盖整个院子的花园，这样我们就可以自己种食物。
