30
Okay, so New Year's resolution, let's break this phrase down.
好的，新年决心，让我们拆解这个短语。

31
The first phrase is New Year's, so the New Year is January 1st in the West, and it is celebrated on the 31st of December at night when the clock changes to the New Year, and a New Year's resolution, remember that S there, is something that you want to do or to change in the New Year.
第一个短语是新年，所以在西方，新年是1月1日，庆祝活动在12月31日晚上，当时钟变成新年时进行，而新年决心，记住那个S，是你想在新年做或改变的事情。

32
It's a fresh start.
这是一个新的开始。

33
Okay, so you pretty much, the verb that you use there is to resolve to do something, so my New Year's resolution is to go to the gym every day.
好吧，你基本上使用的动词是决心去做某事，所以我的新年决心是每天去健身房。

34
It's like a promise to yourself.

确切地说，我们可以在最后谈论这个，但很多公司试图利用这个来向美国人销售愚蠢的东西，所以我们一会儿再谈。

37
The two people in this dialogue are talking about the idea of spending more time with friends and family, and the other person says, well sometimes it's hard to do that because you have to provide your family with goods and services.
对话中的两个人在谈论花更多时间与朋友和家人在一起的想法，另一个人说，有时这很难做到，因为你必须为家人提供商品和服务。
