3
My name is Katherine, and today we've got an upper intermediate level lesson for you all about money.
我叫Katherine，今天我们有一节关于金钱的中高级课程。

4
That's right.
没错。

5
We are going to talk about the stock market.
我们将讨论股市。

6
So a very interesting topic, very current as well, because, well, throughout the world, stock markets are not doing very well.
这是一个非常有趣的话题，也很时事，因为，全球的股市表现都不太好。

7
That's right.
没错。

8
And you may have seen on the television a lot of information about this.
你可能在电视上看到很多关于这个的信息。

9
So today we're going to hopefully explain some of the things and phrases and words that you've been hearing.
所以今天我们希望能解释一些你们听到的事情、短语和词汇。

10
But first, we've got a couple of important indicators, a couple of acronyms, actually, that you're going to hear about.
但首先，我们有几个重要的指标，实际上是几个缩略词，你将会听到。

11
So let's look at those in today's vocabulary preview.
那么让我们在今天的词汇预览中看看这些。

12
All right.
好的。

13
So the first word that we have on vocabulary preview is the NASDAQ.
所以我们在词汇预览中的第一个词是NASDAQ。

14
NASDAQ.
NASDAQ。

15
NASDAQ.
NASDAQ。

16
N-A-S-D-A-Q.
N-A-S-D-A-Q。

17
So this is basically the American stock market.
这基本上是美国的股市。

18
Right.
对。

19
It's an acronym.
这是一个缩略词。

20
Now, it's a really, really long acronym, so we're not going to get into it, but it is basically the American stock market where all these companies are trading stock, publicly traded companies.
现在，这是一个非常非常长的缩略词，所以我们不深入讨论，但它基本上是所有这些公司交易股票的美国股市，公开交易的公司。

21
Right.
对。

22
So publicly traded companies, you're basically trading their stocks through NASDAQ.
所以公开交易的公司，你基本上是通过NASDAQ交易他们的股票。

23
Right.
对。

24
And now the next one that we have is an indicator which tells us how well some companies or some stock are doing, and that's the Dow Jones indicator.
现在我们下一个是一个指标，它告诉我们一些公司或股票的表现如何，那就是道琼斯指标。

25
Dow Jones indicator.
道琼斯指标。

26
So maybe if the Dow Jones is really low for something, we think, man, it's not doing so well.
所以如果道琼斯很低，我们可能会想，嗯，它表现得不好。

27
Right.
对。

28
If it goes up, things are improving.
如果它上涨，情况就好转了。

29
Right.
对。

30
So usually the Dow Jones has the... it's based upon the 50 biggest companies in the United States, the 50 biggest publicly traded companies.
所以通常道琼斯是基于美国50家最大的公司，50家最大的公开交易公司。

31
Now, you can divide it into like industrial companies or pharmaceutical companies, et cetera.
现在，你可以将其分为工业公司或制药公司等。

32
But in general, that's the indicator and how it works.
但一般来说，这就是指标及其运作方式。

33
Great.
很好。

34
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and find out how these words are used in context.
那么让我们听听今天的对话，看看这些词是如何在上下文中使用的。

35
And we're back in a moment to talk about what's going on.
我们马上回来讨论发生了什么。

36
Sorry to bother you, sir, but I have some bad news.
抱歉打扰您，先生，但我有一些坏消息。

37
What is it?

43
Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth one week ago.
我们的投资组合价值只有一周前的一半。

44
How is this possible?

45
You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return.
你应该和我们的股票经纪人沟通，确保我们的证券和投资是安全的，并且能获得盈利回报。

46
I know, sir.
我知道，先生。

47
We didn't expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden.
我们没想到牛市会突然变成熊市。

48
On the other hand, you still have some high yield, trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our losses and reinvest in emerging markets.
另一方面，你仍然有一些高收益的垃圾债券和政府债券，这将给我们足够的流动性来减少损失并重新投资于新兴市场。

49
We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box.
我们可以将这场悲剧转化为我们的优势，激发我们的创新思维。

50
Do what you have to do.
你该做什么就做什么。

51
One other thing.
还有一件事。

52
Don't tell the rest of the stockholders about this if they find out it's the end of this company.
如果其他股东知道这件事，那这家公司就完了，别告诉他们。

53
All right, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

54
So a lot of interesting words there.
所以有很多有趣的词。

55
I think a lot of them were very specific to the stock market and very maybe a little bit difficult.
我觉得很多词非常特定于股市，可能有点难。

56
So why don't we take a look at a couple of those and language takeaway.
那么我们来看看其中几个词和语言要点。

57
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

58
OK, so this first word is a very important word in banking and finance.
好的，第一个词在银行和金融中非常重要。

59
We talk about portfolios a lot.
我们经常谈论投资组合。

60
So portfolio.
所以投资组合。

61
Right.
对。

62
So basically a portfolio is the variety of things that you own.
所以投资组合基本上是你拥有的各种东西。

63
For example, in the stock market, it could be stocks, it could be bonds, it can be mutual funds, etc.
例如，在股市中，它可以是股票、债券、共同基金等。

64
Or, for example, if you're a company, your product portfolio could be all the products that your company owns.
或者，例如，如果你是一家公司，你的产品组合可以是你公司拥有的所有产品。

65
That's right.
没错。

66
So in this case, our portfolio is worth half what it was a week ago.
所以在这种情况下，我们的投资组合价值只有一周前的一半。

67
And so this is this is a sentence that means we've lost half of the money we invested.
这句话的意思是我们损失了我们投资的一半钱。

68
All of our investments are in a portfolio.
我们所有的投资都在一个投资组合中。

69
We talk about them as a portfolio.
我们将它们称为投资组合。

70
And when we lose money, we mean our portfolio is worth less now than it was before.
当我们亏损时，我们的投资组合的价值比之前少了。

71
Exactly.
正是如此。

72
And well, moving on, he starts to talk about the bull market and the bear market.
接下来，他开始谈论牛市和熊市。

73
So what is what is this all about?
这到底是怎么回事？

74
Well, a bull is an animal with horns, right?
嗯，牛是一种有角的动物，对吧？

75
And a bear is another animal.
而熊是另一种动物。

76
So we're not talking about animals here, right?
所以我们这里不是在谈论动物，对吧？

77
We're talking about special finance phrases.
我们在谈论特殊的金融术语。

78
Right.
对。

79
So the bull market would be a again, talking about companies and trading.
所以牛市是再次谈论公司和交易。

80
It would be maybe a market that's growing very rapidly.
这可能是一个快速增长的市场。

81
That's very, very strong.
非常强劲。

82
That's a bull market.
这就是牛市。

83
So people often talk about China's bull market, right?
所以人们常常谈论中国的牛市，对吧？

84
How China continues to grow and grow and grow and grow.
中国如何不断增长。

85
But a market that slows down, like the United States last year, would be a bear market.
但像去年美国那样放缓的市场就是熊市。

86
Right.
对。

87
So think of a bear.
所以想象一下熊。

88
Maybe it's sleeping.
也许它在睡觉。

89
It goes into hibernation.
它进入冬眠。

90
That's a bear market.
这就是熊市。

91
So a slow market.
所以是一个缓慢的市场。

92
It's not really growing.
它并没有真正增长。

93
Very good.
非常好。

94
But talking about a portfolio again, we might have stocks, but in this case, the two people are talking about their bonds.
但再次谈论投资组合，我们可能有股票，但在这种情况下，两个人在谈论他们的债券。

95
So he says you still have some high yield to trash bonds and government bonds.
所以他说你仍然有一些高收益的垃圾债券和政府债券。

96
What's a high yield bond and what's a trash bond?
什么是高收益债券，什么是垃圾债券？

97
OK, so when we think about the word yield is how much it gives, right?
好的，当我们想到收益这个词时，就是它给了多少，对吧？

98
So how much we are getting from it.
所以我们从中获得了多少。

99
So something that is high yield means that you're getting a lot from it.
所以高收益意味着你从中获得了很多。

100
For example, this orange tree yields 300 oranges per year.
例如，这棵橙树每年产300个橙子。

101
OK, so how much we get from it.
好的，那我们能得到多少。

102
Exactly.
正是如此。

103
So we're getting 300 oranges.
所以我们得到300个橙子。

104
That's how much it's yielding.
这就是它的产量。

105
And so basically that's what yield means.
所以基本上这就是产量的意思。

106
So when we talk about trash bonds, this on the other hand, it's a word that's maybe a little bit tricky, but a bond is a promise that you get from the seller that he's going to pay you back the money that you give him with interest.
当我们谈论垃圾债券时，这个词可能有点棘手，但债券是你从卖方那里得到的承诺，他会把你给他的钱连同利息还给你。

107
Right.
对。

108
But a trash bond is a very risky bond.
但垃圾债券是非常高风险的债券。

109
It means that the seller might not pay you back because, you know, he's still trying to get all the money.
这意味着卖方可能不会还你钱，因为他还在努力筹集所有的钱。

110
All right.
好吧。

111
But a high yield trash bond means that you might make a lot of money from this bond unless, of course, it's not very dependable.
但高收益垃圾债券意味着你可能会从这债券中赚很多钱，当然，前提是它不是很可靠。

112
Exactly.
正是如此。

113
So it's risky.
所以这是有风险的。

114
Of course, since it's riskier, it has more yield.
当然，由于它更具风险性，它的收益也更高。

115
Great.
很好。

116
So high yields trash bond.
所以高收益垃圾债券。

117
And then what about this?
那么这个呢？

118
They will give us liquidity to cut our losses.
它们会给我们流动性以减少损失。

119
Liquidity.

120
We hear all about liquidity in finance.
我们在金融中听到很多关于流动性的讨论。

121
Exactly.
正是如此。

122
Maybe in your company, the accountant will talk about this.
也许在你的公司，会计会谈论这个。

123
And that's basically just to have money cash in hand.
基本上就是手头有现金。

124
So you have money to pay things or to buy things.
所以你有钱支付或购买东西。

125
Right.
对。

126
So it's available.
所以它是可用的。

127
Available.

128
Yeah.
是的。

129
Not with credit.

130

134
Let's think outside the box.

We could reinvest in emerging markets.

136
And this is a very hot topic lately, talking about emerging markets.

138
To rise.
上升。

139
Yeah.
是的。

140
To come out.
出现。

141
So it's almost like new or growing markets.
所以这几乎就像是新的或正在增长的市场。

142
So in this case, a market, an emerging market would be, for example, the Southeast Asian market, which is growing quickly, or even, you could say, West African market.
在这种情况下，新兴市场可能是，例如，快速增长的东南亚市场，或者你甚至可以说是西非市场。

143
