好吧，那个人谈到成为这个名为Granger's Gourmet Bombons公司的唯一分销商。

69
This is a person or a company, and the distributor is someone who distributes or sells a product, right?

He will get all these goods from the factory, and then he will be the one that gives it to the different retail stores.
他会从工厂获取所有这些商品，然后他会将其提供给不同的零售店。

So he can have many clients, and he is the main person who you get it from.

So obviously they don't get it directly from the factory.

Okay, so this person, a distributor or a company, is in the middle of the transaction.

On one side there is the manufacturer, and on the other side there is the retail market or stores.

But what happens when we want to move a good out of a country?
但是当我们想要将商品运出一个国家时会发生什么？

83
Okay, so that is our third word for today.
好的，这就是我们今天的第三个词。

84
Usually in customs we have to pay a tariff for these goods, or a tax.
通常在海关我们需要为这些商品支付关税，或者说税。

Okay, so a tariff is a special kind of tax that you pay when you are trying to export or send outside of your country goods that you've made in that country.
好的，关税是一种特殊的税，当你试图出口或将你在该国制造的商品发送到国外时需要支付的税。
