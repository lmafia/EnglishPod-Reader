钉枪。

77

Now this is an advanced tool, so you don't have to use a hammer.
现在这是一个高级工具，所以你不需要使用锤子。

82
It's kind of hard to explain, so why don't we listen to the sound this tool makes?
这有点难以解释，所以我们不如听听这个工具发出的声音？

83
Well, I guess like its name suggests, it's a gun for putting nails in wood.
嗯，我想就像它的名字所暗示的那样，它是一个用来把钉子打入木头的枪。

100
You have a band saw, you have a circular saw, and this one makes this sound.

131
We'll do our best to describe it for you.

139
Fluency builder.

所以当承包商开始给他们指示时，他说，我需要每个人今天都付出110%。

141
To give 110%.
付出110%。

143
