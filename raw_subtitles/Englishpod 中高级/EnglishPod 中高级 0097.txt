好的，所以是一股突然的冷空气进入一个地方。

164
So we say a cold front is moving in.
所以我们说一个冷锋正在逼近。

165
So we always think of these cold fronts or warm fronts as moving.
所以我们总是认为这些冷锋或暖锋是移动的。

166
So you can either say they're moving in, or you can say a cold front is coming in.
所以你可以说它们正在逼近，或者你可以说一个冷锋正在来临。

So when I say it's coming in from... You're talking about its origin, where it starts.
所以当我说它从...吹来时，你在谈论它的来源，开始的地方。

172
Okay, so if I change the noun and I say, and I don't say winds anymore, but maybe I'll say my friends.
好的，所以如果我换个名词，我不再说风，而是说我的朋友。

173
My friends are coming in from...
