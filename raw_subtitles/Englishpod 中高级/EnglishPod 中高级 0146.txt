Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another edition here at EnglishPod.
大家好，欢迎回到EnglishPod的另一期节目。

2
My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

3
And my name is Catherine, and today we've got a great upper intermediate level lesson for you all about animal and human rights.
我叫Catherine，今天我们有一节关于动物和人权的高级中级课程。

4
Right.
对。

5
So it's a very debatable topic.
这是一个非常有争议的话题。

6
People want to protect animals, mistreatment of animals.
人们想要保护动物，反对虐待动物。

7
And this is what we're going to talk about today, protecting animals and giving them rights.
今天我们要讨论的就是保护动物和赋予它们权利。

8
Do you think animals have rights?
你认为动物有权利吗？

9
Well, you know, I think we could leave that for the end.
嗯，我想我们可以留到最后再讨论这个。

10
I don't want to, you know, influence the argument here in today's dialogue.
我不想在今天的对话中影响这个论点。

11
But yeah, as you've said, I think it's very much a topic that people can go both ways on.
但正如你所说，我认为这是一个人们可以有不同看法的话题。

12
So why don't we listen to our dialogue as two people discuss animal rights, and let's get their opinions on things.
那我们为什么不听听对话，让两个人讨论动物权利，看看他们的看法呢？

13
You should have seen the TV show that was on last night.
你应该看看昨晚的电视节目。

14
The topic it covered was really interesting.
讨论的话题非常有趣。

15
Animal rights.
动物权利。

16
Do you really believe in that?
你真的相信这个吗？

17
If they're going to focus on something, they should do it on civil rights.
如果他们要专注于某个话题，应该是公民权利。

18
Yes, but we can't deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless, and are completely at the mercy of human beings.
是的，但我们不能否认动物是脆弱的、无助的，完全处于人类的支配之下。

19
I understand your point, but we continue to have transgressions against human rights.
我理解你的观点，但我们仍然有对人权的侵犯。

20
If so much attention weren't devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.
如果没有那么多关注动物的话题，我们就会更多地集中精力拯救人类，而不是保护考拉。

21
You can't compare apples and oranges.
你不能拿苹果和橘子比较。

22
I believe that both topics are important and that we can't ignore them.
我相信这两个话题都很重要，我们不能忽视它们。

23
The mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance.
虐待动物会造成巨大的环境失衡。

24
I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.
我认为政府应该禁止偷猎等活动。

25
Well, you are right on that point.
嗯，你说得对。

26
This is the reason that I don't buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products.
这就是我不买皮革，尽量购买合成产品的原因。

27
At least you're doing your part.
至少你在尽自己的一份力。

28
My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family.
我的贡献是养一只宠物，把它当作家里的家庭成员。

29
As long as you don't treat it better than your wife, it's fine.
只要你不把它当得比你的妻子好就行。

30
All right, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

31
And both of them have good points, right?
他们都有很好的观点，对吧？

32
In favor and against, and as you said, they also talk about human rights, which is also a very important topic.
有支持的也有反对的，正如你所说，他们也谈到了人权，这也是一个非常重要的话题。

33
But before we discuss this topic, why don't we take a look at the language that was used now in Language Takeaway.
但在我们讨论这个话题之前，为什么不先看看现在在语言要点中使用的语言呢？

34
All right, so in Language Takeaway, our first word today is vulnerable.
好的，在语言要点中，今天的第一个单词是脆弱。

35
Okay, vulnerable is a great word.
好的，脆弱是个好词。

36
It's a way to describe something.
这是用来描述某事的方式。

37
And so something is vulnerable if it can't really protect itself.
所以某事是脆弱的，如果它不能真正保护自己。

38
So you are in danger of being hurt.
所以你处于受伤的危险中。

39
Exactly.
正是如此。

40
Right, so you're vulnerable.
对，所以你是脆弱的。

41
Now, this isn't only used for animals, right?
现在，这不仅仅用于动物，对吧？

42
It can be like an army is vulnerable if they don't have strong defenses on the border.
如果军队没有强大的边界防御，他们也是脆弱的。

43
Right, or my emotions.
对，或者我的情感。

44
I'm feeling vulnerable because I just had a really horrible week and I'm really depressed and I'm emotionally vulnerable.
我感到脆弱，因为我刚经历了一个非常糟糕的星期，我真的很沮丧，情感上很脆弱。

45
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

46
So, vulnerable.
所以，脆弱。

47
And they also talked about transgressions against human rights.
他们还谈到了对人权的侵犯。

48
All right, so a transgression is a thing.
好的，侵犯是一个名词。

49
It's a noun.
侵犯就像是对某人或某事做一些有害的事情。

50
And a transgression is like doing something harmful to or against someone or something.
所以侵犯是一个名词。

51
So a transgression, it's a noun.
那是不是做一些不好的事情？

52
So is it doing something in a bad way?
正是如此，这是件坏事。

53
Exactly, it's a bad thing.
它总是负面的。

54
It's always negative.
不是积极的，对吧？

55
It's not positive, right?
对，所以在许多祷告中，例如在基督教信仰中，你会说，主啊，原谅我的侵犯。

56
Right, and so in many prayers, for example, in the Christian faith, you say, you know, Lord forgive me for my transgressions.
因为有点越过了从做好事到做坏事的界限。

57
For having kind of crossed the line from doing good things to bad things.
所以你在做坏事。

58
So you're doing bad things.
非常好。

59
Very good.
所以这是个很好的说法。

60
So that's a good way of putting it.
越过界限。

61
To cross the line.
有点超出你应该的范围。

62
To kind of go beyond where you should.
好的，所以侵犯。

63
All right, so transgressions.
现在，世界上另一个非常严重的问题是偷猎。

64
And now another very serious problem in the world is poaching.
这是他们说应该控制的事情之一。

65
That's one of the things that they said they should control.
偷猎。

66
Poaching.
好的，你可能在不同的语境中听过这个词，因为它确实有另一个意思，但我只会解释我们在这里讨论的一个意思，即杀死动物，特别是为了运动或出售它们的皮毛。

67
All right, you might have heard this word in a different context because it does have another meaning, but I'm just going to explain the one meaning here that we're talking about, which is killing animals, especially for sport or for selling their skins and their fur.
对，所以这就是偷猎。

68
Right, so that's poaching.
偷猎和狩猎有什么区别？

69
What's the difference between poaching and hunting?

70
Hunting can be legal.
狩猎可以是合法的。

71
Poaching is illegal.
偷猎是非法的。

72
Okay, so that's the main difference.
好的，这就是主要区别。

73
Hunting is usually for sport.
狩猎通常是为了运动。

74
You hunt either for food or for sport, right?
你狩猎是为了食物还是为了运动，对吧？

75
Legal hunting.
合法狩猎。

76
But poaching is usually you want to sell, like you said, the fur or the skins or something.
但偷猎通常是你想出售，比如你说的皮毛或皮肤之类的东西。

77
Or the tusks on rhinos or something like that.
或者是犀牛的象牙之类的东西。

78
Exactly.
正是如此。

79
All right, so poaching.
好的，所以偷猎。

80
And then they talked about synthetic products.
然后他们谈到了合成产品。

81
So what is a synthetic product?
那么什么是合成产品？

82
Well, a synthetic product is something that is man-made.
嗯，合成产品是人造的东西。

83
So it's not natural in that it doesn't come from the earth.
所以它不是自然的，因为它不来自地球。

84
Cotton is a natural product and plastic, for example, is synthetic.
棉花是自然产品，而塑料，例如，是合成的。

85
Or nylon.
或者尼龙。

86
Nylon is a really good synthetic product.
尼龙是一个非常好的合成产品。

87
And so people who don't want to use animal products, like wool or leather, they prefer to use synthetic products.
所以不想使用动物产品的人，比如羊毛或皮革，他们更喜欢使用合成产品。

88
And I think maybe you've heard this in clothing.
我想你可能在衣物中听过这个。

89
It's called synthetic fibers, right?
它被称为合成纤维，对吧？

90
Like nylon or polyester.
像尼龙或聚酯。

91
Exactly.
正是如此。

92
These are all the words that we have for language takeaway today.
这些就是我们今天语言要点中的所有单词。

93
So why don't we move on now to a couple of very interesting phrases that we saw in the dialogue now in Fluency Builder.
那么我们现在为什么不继续看一下在流利表达中看到的几个非常有趣的短语呢？

94
Fluency Builder.
流利表达。

95
Okay, this first phrase is, well, it's a common one, but it's definitely not used in very happy circumstances.
好的，第一个短语是，嗯，这是一个常见的短语，但绝对不是在非常快乐的情况下使用。

96
We say that something or someone is at the mercy of someone else.
我们说某事或某人处于某人的支配之下。

97
Okay, so animals are at the mercy of human beings.
好的，所以动物处于人类的支配之下。

98
What does this mean exactly?
这到底是什么意思？

99
Mercy.
仁慈。

100
So basically it means that the animals, in this case, don't have control of what's going on.
所以基本上这意味着动物，在这种情况下，无法控制发生的事情。

101
So human beings are the ones that control everything.
所以人类控制一切。

102
So if I decide to kill them, then they are at my mercy, at my will, at my whim.
如果我决定杀死它们，那么它们就完全听从我的意愿。

103
Exactly.
正是如此。

104
And so you could say, I'm at your mercy, Marco, please just like help me out with this.
所以你可以说，我在你的掌控之中，马尔科，请帮我一下。

105
It's like you're the one in control.
就像你是控制者。

106
You're the one who can help the situation.
你是能帮助这个情况的人。

107
Will you help?
你会帮忙吗？

108
Exactly.
正是如此。

109
I'm at the mercy of someone.
我在某人的掌控之中。

110
And then they were talking and debating this thing and an interesting comparison came up.
然后他们在讨论这个事情时，出现了一个有趣的比较。

111
You can't compare apples and oranges.
你不能拿苹果和橙子比较。

112
All right, you're going to hear this all the time in English.
好吧，你会在英语中经常听到这个。

113
It's not just a funny little phrase that the person uses.
这不仅仅是一个人使用的有趣短语。

114
It's a very common idiom.
这是一个非常常见的习语。

115
And so we say, it's like apples and oranges, or you can't compare apples and oranges.
所以我们说，这就像苹果和橙子，或者你不能比较苹果和橙子。

116
And this is essentially saying these are two different things.
这基本上是在说这两者是不同的东西。

117
Completely different.
完全不同。

118
Completely different.
完全不同。

119
So I can't compare him and her because it's apples and oranges.
所以我不能比较他和她，因为这是苹果和橙子。

120
They're two different things, two different people.
他们是两种不同的东西，两种不同的人。

121
Right.
对。

122
Because that's what, in the movie, you said they were like peas and carrots.
因为在电影中，你说他们就像豌豆和胡萝卜。

123
They just go together well.
他们搭配得很好。

124
They go together.
他们很合拍。

125
Does that make sense?
这有道理吗？

126
Not really.
不太。

127
Forrest Gump is a little bit strange like that.
《阿甘正传》有点奇怪。

128
But I think the meaning is that if I say that's a big apple and I say that's a small apple, they're all apples so I can compare them.
但我认为意思是，如果我说这是一个大苹果，我说这是一个小苹果，它们都是苹果，所以我可以比较它们。

129
But I say this is a really big orange and that's a really big apple.
但我说这是一个非常大的橙子，那是一个非常大的苹果。

130
Well, they're different.
嗯，它们是不同的。

131
You just can't compare them.
你就是不能比较它们。

132
All right.
好吧。

133
And towards the end, the person said that you're doing your part.
在最后，那个说你在尽自己的一份力。

134
You're doing your part.
你在尽自己的一份力。

135
Yeah.
是的。

136
So this is a hard one to understand sometimes because it's not like a part in a play.
所以有时候这很难理解，因为这不是剧中的一个角色。

137
It's more like a part in society.
这更像是社会中的一个角色。

138
You're helping make society or culture or civilization better.
你在帮助改善社会、文化或文明。

139
So you're contributing.
所以你在贡献。

140
So, for example, what would be an example of a person doing their part towards society?
那么，例如，什么是一个人在社会中尽自己的一份力的例子？

141
Well, for example, I don't own a car.
嗯，例如，我没有车。

142
I ride my bike.
我骑自行车。

143
And it's my way of doing my part to help the environment.
这是我为帮助环境尽自己的一份力。

144
Okay.
好的。

145
Very good.
非常好。

146
Because obviously I can't buy a factory that's very green or I can't do all these things to change the world.
因为显然我不能买一个非常环保的工厂，或者我不能做所有这些事情来改变世界。

147
So I'm going to do small things.
所以我会做一些小事情。

148
Those are my way of doing my part.
这些是我尽自己的一份力的方式。

149
Okay.
好的。

150
So another example would be recycling.
另一个例子是回收。

151
That's doing your part.
这就是尽自己的一份力。

152
Exactly.
正是如此。

153
Or in this case, the person bought only synthetic products, nothing made from nature.
或者在这种情况下，这个人只购买合成产品，什么都不买自然产品。

154
All right.
好吧。

155
Very good.
非常好。

156
So very interesting phrases.
所以非常有趣的短语。

157
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll be right back.
我们为什么不最后再听一次我们的对话，然后我们马上回来。

158
You should have seen the TV show that was on last night.
你应该看看昨晚的电视节目。

159
The topic it covered was really interesting.
它讨论的话题非常有趣。

160
Animal rights.
动物权利。

161
Do you really believe in that?
你真的相信这个吗？

162
If they're going to focus on something, they should do it on civil rights.
如果他们要专注于某事，他们应该专注于民权。

163
Yes, but we can't deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless, and are completely at the mercy of human beings.
是的，但我们不能否认动物是脆弱的、无助的，完全处于人类的掌控之中。

164
I understand your point, but we continue to have transgressions against human rights.
我理解你的观点，但我们仍然有对人权的侵犯。

165
In this case, if so much attention weren't devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.
在这种情况下，如果没有那么多关注动物的话题，我们就会更多地集中在拯救一个人而不是保护一只考拉。

166
You can't compare apples and oranges.
你不能比较苹果和橙子。

167
I believe that both topics are important and that we can't ignore them.
我相信这两个话题都很重要，我们不能忽视它们。

168
The mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance.
对动物的虐待会造成巨大的环境失衡。

169
I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.
我相信政府应该禁止偷猎等活动。

170
Well, you are right on that point.
嗯，你在这一点上是对的。

171
This is the reason that I don't buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products.
这就是我不买皮革，尽量购买合成产品的原因。

172
At least you're doing your part.
至少你在尽自己的一份力。

173
My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family.
我的贡献是养一只宠物，把它当作家庭成员来对待。

174
As long as you don't treat it better than your wife, it's fine.
只要你不把它当得比你的妻子更好就可以。

175
Alright, so a debatable topic, animals and animal rights.
好吧，所以这是一个有争议的话题，动物和动物权利。

176
What do you think?
你怎么看？

177
Well, I'll say this.
嗯，我会这么说。

178
I would be a hypocrite if I said that it's bad to hurt animals because I'm a meat eater.
如果我说伤害动物是错的，那我就是个伪君子，因为我是个肉食者。

179
I like to eat meat and I like to wear leather.
我喜欢吃肉，也喜欢穿皮革。

180
But I do think it's bad to mistreat animals.
但我确实认为虐待动物是错的。

181
So I really try to buy free range chicken or meat from places I know that treat the animals well.
所以我真的尽量购买放养的鸡或我知道对动物好的地方的肉。

182
And I definitely disagree with poaching and with using animals, especially endangered animals, for money and cash purposes.
我绝对不同意偷猎和利用动物，尤其是濒危动物，来赚钱。

183
And so that's my position.
这就是我的立场。

184
But, well, serious, I know you eat meat too.
但是，嗯，认真说，我知道你也吃肉。

185
No, yeah, of course.
不，是的，当然。

186
And I think even though protection of animals is a very important topic and you don't want the mistreatment of these little creatures that are very vulnerable to us because we're smarter than them in the end.
我认为即使动物保护是一个非常重要的话题，你也不想让这些脆弱的小生物受到虐待，因为我们最终比它们聪明。

187
But I think also it has to do a lot with superstitions sometimes and kind of mystical and magical things.
但我认为这有时也与迷信和某种神秘的东西有关。

188
For example, people killing rhinos because they believe that the rhino horn has amazing curing properties or the same thing with elephant tusks and stuff like that.
例如，人们杀死犀牛，因为他们相信犀牛角具有神奇的治愈特性，象牙也是如此。

189
So it also involves this certain aspect that people almost don't know any better.
所以这也涉及到某种人们几乎不知道更好的方面。

190
They truly believe that these things actually work or that they will help them.
他们真的相信这些东西有效，或者会帮助他们。

191
So they don't consider, like the dialogue said, the imbalance that they create in the environment or the consequences.
所以他们没有考虑到，正如对话所说，他们在环境中造成的失衡或后果。

192
Or there might be some very serious evolutionary consequences that we cannot even imagine.
或者可能会有一些非常严重的进化后果，我们甚至无法想象。

193
And so, you know, things change kind of over time, sometimes quickly and sometimes slowly.
所以，你知道，事情随着时间的推移而变化，有时快速，有时缓慢。

194
But if we force change really quickly, who knows what the results are going to be.
但如果我们强迫快速变化，谁知道结果会是什么。

195
It might be really negative for us.
这可能对我们非常负面。

196
Exactly.
正是如此。

197
And that's what we want to know now.
这就是我们现在想知道的。

198
What do you think about these topics?
你对这些话题怎么看？

199
Because in the end, the environment, animals, they're all connected.
因为最终，环境、动物，它们都是相互关联的。

200
If you wipe out all the foxes in a forest, then you're going to have too many snakes running around, right?
如果你在森林中消灭所有的狐狸，那么你就会有太多的蛇在四处游荡，对吧？

201
So what do you think?
那你觉得怎么样？

202
