And today we're talking about being on the road.
今天我们要谈论在路上的事情。

6
Yeah, we're gonna be on the road, but we're gonna encounter a little bit of car problems.
是的，我们要在路上，但会遇到一些汽车问题。

7
My favorite kind.
我最喜欢的那种。

8
I think it's happened to everyone.
我想这发生在每个人身上。

9
You're on the road or maybe you're coming back from work.

10
You get a flat tire or something happens to your car, right?
你轮胎爆了，或者你的车出了什么事，对吧？

11
And it's always when you're in a rush.
而且总是在你赶时间的时候。

12
And so, all of the circumstances definitely, well, they don't help, let's just say.
所以，所有的情况肯定，嗯，没什么帮助，简单来说。

13
Alright, so before we listen to this dialogue, let's take a look at some of the words in today's vocabulary preview.
好吧，在我们听这个对话之前，先看看今天词汇预览中的一些单词。

14
Alright, so we're gonna take a look at two words.
好吧，我们要看两个单词。

15
They're kind of strange, I don't know, kind of difficult to understand, so that's where we're gonna explain them.
它们有点奇怪，我不知道，有点难以理解，所以我们会解释一下。

16
The first one is to spew.
第一个是“喷出”。

17
It's a verb, okay?
这是一个动词，好的？

18
To spew.
喷出。

19
Well, what can spew?

22
An engine can spew.

23
A person can spew.
人也可以喷出。

24
Yeah, that's not very nice.
是的，这可不太好。

25
No.

26
So basically, it's to like expel or to... Shoot out.
所以基本上，它是像排出或... 喷出。

27
Shoot out from your mouth or something liquid.
从你的嘴里或某种液体喷出。

28
So in the case of a person, right?
所以在一个人的情况下，对吧？

29
So if a person spews, it means a person throws up, but it's usually very forceful.
如果一个人喷出，意味着一个人呕吐，但通常是非常猛烈的。

30
Alright, it's very messy.
好吧，这很麻烦。

31
A volcano can spew lava.
火山可以喷出熔岩。

32
Exactly.
正是如此。

33
So, a volcano is spewing lava.

So it's an informal way, very popular, very common, I would say, to describe that something is not working.
所以这是一种非正式的说法，非常流行，我会说，描述某物不工作的状态。

40
I don't think many people actually say, well, it's broken or it's damaged.
我觉得很多人其实不会说，嗯，它坏了或者它损坏了。

41
Yeah, they're pretty much mixed, I think, but you will definitely hear busted if you're talking to native English speakers.
是的，我认为它们基本上是混合的，但如果你和以英语为母语的人交谈，你肯定会听到“坏了”。

42
Or even like, for example, your arm.
或者甚至，比如说，你的手臂。

43
Oh, he's got a busted arm.
哦，他的手臂坏了。

44
Exactly.
正是如此。

45
So busted.

46
All right, so let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.
好吧，让我们第一次听听我们的对话。

47
Let's see what's going on with this car trouble, and then we'll come back and explain some things.
让我们看看这次汽车故障发生了什么，然后我们再回来解释一些事情。

48
Howdy.
嗨。

49
Nice car.
好车。

50
What seems to be the problem?

My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month.
我爸爸上个月给我买了这辆车作为生日礼物。

60
It's brand new.
它是全新的。

61
Well, Missy, the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator.
好吧，小姑娘，你看到的白烟是散热器的蒸汽。

62
You overheated your engine, so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission.
你的引擎过热了，所以活塞坏了，变速箱也坏了。

63
You should have called us and we could have told you over here when your car died.
你应该打电话给我们，我们可以在你的车坏掉时告诉你。

64
So how long is this gonna take?
那这要多久？

65
An hour?
一个小时？

66
I'm afraid a bit more than that.
恐怕要多一点。

67
We need to order the spare parts, take apart your electrical system, fuel pump and engine, and then put it back together again.
我们需要订购备件，拆卸你的电气系统、燃油泵和引擎，然后再组装起来。

68
You're gonna have to leave it here for at least two weeks.
你得把它留在这里至少两周。

69
What?
什么？

70
How am I supposed to go to school or go shopping?
我该怎么去上学或购物？

71
This is not happening.
这不可能发生。

72
So if I were the mechanic, I would not be very happy to be dealing with someone like this girl.
所以如果我是机械师，我不会很高兴和这样的女孩打交道。

73
Well, maybe it's a little bit stereotypical that we put it as a girl because guys and girls, so many people don't know anything about cars or mechanics.
嗯，也许把它设定为女孩有点刻板印象，因为男孩和女孩，很多人对汽车或机械一无所知。

74
And in the States, there's a lot of female mechanics too, so it's mixed.
在美国，也有很多女性机械师，所以这是混合的。

75
But definitely it's something that happens all the time and probably the mechanic will overcharge her as well because apparently she doesn't know what she's doing.
但这绝对是经常发生的事情，可能机械师也会多收她的钱，因为显然她不知道自己在做什么。

76
And that's one of the reasons we want to give you the vocabulary to deal with these situations.
这也是我们想给你提供词汇以应对这些情况的原因之一。

77
So let's look at some of those car words in today's language take away.
所以让我们看看今天语言学习中的一些汽车词汇。

78
Alright, so we're gonna take a look at very specific words related to cars and the engines and everything.
好吧，我们要看一些与汽车和引擎及其他相关的非常具体的单词。

79
So let's start with the first one.
所以让我们从第一个开始。

80
Radiator.
散热器。

81
Radiator.
散热器。

82
Alright, so the radiator of the car.
好吧，汽车的散热器。

83
So radiator is something that you normally find in the front of the car near the engine.
散热器通常位于汽车前部靠近引擎的位置。

84
It usually gets very, very hot, right?
它通常会变得非常非常热，对吧？

85
Yeah.
是的。

86
So one of the big issues is radiators getting too hot because there's no way to cool them down.
所以一个大问题是散热器过热，因为没有办法让它冷却下来。

87
So if you live in a place that's very hot, the radiator keeps your engine cool because it has water in it.
所以如果你住在一个非常热的地方，散热器可以保持你的引擎冷却，因为里面有水。

88
So if it overheats, or maybe you didn't put enough water in there, then it'll start spewing steam like in this dialogue.
所以如果它过热，或者你可能没有放足够的水进去，那么它就会开始像在这个对话中那样喷出蒸汽。

89
And if you have a problem with your radiator, you could actually do a lot of damage to your engine, which is why this is important.
如果你的散热器有问题，你实际上可能会对你的引擎造成很大的损害，这就是为什么这很重要。

90
Exactly.
正是如此。

91
And that's what happened in this dialogue.
这就是在这个对话中发生的事情。

92
So a radiator now because the radiator wasn't working well, it overheated the engine, and he said they had some busted pistons.
所以散热器现在因为散热器工作不良，导致引擎过热，他说他们有一些坏掉的活塞。

93
So broken pistons, pistons are important because they're kind of like valves that go up and down.
所以坏掉的活塞，活塞很重要，因为它们就像上下移动的阀门。

94
Right.
对。

95
So inside your engine, you have mini explosions, and the pistons move up and down.
所以在你的引擎内部，你有微型爆炸，活塞上下移动。

96
And that's what actually moves your car.
这实际上是推动你的车的动力。

97
Right.
对。

98
And so pistons in general are things in mechanics.
所以活塞通常是机械中的东西。

99
So like a trumpet has pistons, things that go up and down, and that allow for the flow of air or something like that.
所以像小号有活塞，东西上下移动，允许空气或其他东西的流动。

100
Very good.
非常好。

101
So that's a piston.
所以这就是活塞。

102
And well, another very common mechanic term is the transmission.
还有一个非常常见的机械术语是变速器。

103
Alright, so the transmission, what happens if your transmission dies?
好吧，如果你的变速器坏了，会发生什么？

104
Can you still drive?
你还能开车吗？

105
You basically can't move, or maybe you only have one gear or two gears.
基本上你不能移动，或者你可能只有一个档或两个档。

106
Alright, so think about transmission as coming from the word to transmit.
好吧，把变速器想象成来自“传输”这个词。

107
That means to transfer.
这意味着转移。

108
So this is the part of the car that transfers energy or the power to actually move the car.
所以这是汽车中转移能量或动力以实际移动汽车的部分。

109
So the transmission.
所以是变速器。

110
And we've got the mechanic who says, well, we've got to order you some spare parts.
我们有机械师说，我们得为你订购一些备件。

111
So first, let's look at the word spare.
首先，让我们看看“备件”这个词。

112
What's another word for spare?
备件的另一个词是什么？

113
Additional, maybe extra.
额外的，可能是多余的。

114
Right.
对。

115
So spare means extra parts are, well, pieces.
所以备件意味着额外的部分，就是，嗯，零件。

116
So he's talking about ordering a new transmission, new pistons, things to replace the broken things.
所以他在谈论订购新的变速器、新的活塞，替换坏掉的东西。

117
Spare parts.
备件。

118
So this is where you go to the mechanic to get some spare parts and get them installed.
所以这是你去机械师那里获取一些备件并安装它们的地方。

119
You probably don't have many spare parts at home, right?
你家里可能没有很多备件，对吧？

120
You got a transmission lying around.
你有变速器闲置吗？

121
Yeah, so spare parts.
是的，所以备件。

122
And the last word that we're going to take a look at is a fuel pump.
我们要看的最后一个词是燃油泵。

123
Okay, so a pump is, you could have a bike pump, a water pump, water pump.
好吧，泵是，你可以有一个自行车泵，一个水泵，水泵。

124
So these are something, these are some things that we use very, very often, but a fuel pump is something that allows gas gasoline to get into your engine.
这些是我们非常非常常用的东西，但燃油泵是允许汽油进入发动机的东西。

125
So it's basically a device that pushes gasoline into the engine so you can start.
所以它基本上是一个将汽油推入发动机的装置，以便你可以启动。

126
And that's the same thing with the water pump.
水泵也是同样的事情。

127
It's a device that pushes water.
它是一个推水的装置。

128
Or an air pump is something that pushes air into your tires and your bicycle.
或者空气泵是将空气推入你的轮胎和自行车的东西。

129
Exactly, so a fuel pump, water pump, etc.
正是如此，所以燃油泵、水泵等等。

130
Wow, I feel like we know a lot about cars.
哇，我觉得我们对汽车了解很多。

131
Apparently we do, see?
显然我们知道，看到吗？

132
Alright, so now that we've taken a look at all of these great words, let's move on to a couple of phrases in Fluency Builder.
好吧，现在我们已经看过所有这些很棒的词汇，让我们继续学习一些流利构建中的短语。

133
Alright, these are phrases that you hear sometimes when you're talking about electronics, but in today's lesson, we're also talking about specific car phrases, so you're going to hear these all the time at the mechanics.
好吧，这些是你在谈论电子产品时有时会听到的短语，但在今天的课程中，我们也在谈论特定的汽车短语，所以你会在机械师那里经常听到这些。

134
Right, and the first one is, the car suddenly died on me.
对，第一句是，汽车突然坏了。

135
Alright, to die on.
好吧，坏掉。

136
So we keep these two words together, die on.
所以我们把这两个词放在一起，坏掉。

137
Oh man, so while you were driving, your car died.
哦，天哪，所以当你开车时，你的车坏了。

138
It stopped moving.
它停止移动。

139
So that means that it doesn't work anymore.
所以这意味着它不再工作。

140
And it's not only for cars, right?
而且这不仅仅是汽车，对吧？

141
You can say my MP3 player died on me today.
你可以说我的MP3播放器今天坏了。

142
Exactly, and what it means is, it's not like you left it and you forgot about it and you tried it again and it didn't work.
正是如此，它的意思是，不是你把它放下忘记了，然后再试一次它不工作。

143
It means while you're using it, it dies.
这意味着在你使用它时，它坏了。

144
Exactly.
正是如此。

145
It doesn't work.
它不工作。

146
So I think this phrase is a good one to give some other examples, so let's listen.
所以我认为这个短语是一个很好的例子，给出一些其他例子，所以让我们听听。

147
Example 2.
示例2。

148
Get that medicine over here fast or this guy's gonna die on me.
快把那药拿过来，否则这个家伙要死了。

149
Example 3.
示例3。

150
I forgot to charge my mobile phone.
我忘了给我的手机充电。

151
It's gonna die on me soon.
它快要没电了。

152
And so this next one is a phrase you hear, the first thing you hear maybe, when you tell someone you have a car problem.
所以下一个是你听到的短语，也许是你告诉某人你有汽车问题时听到的第一件事。

153
Right, you tell them to pop the hood.
对，你告诉他们打开引擎盖。

154
Or let's pop the hood.
或者让我们打开引擎盖。

155
This means let's open the front part of the car, the hood, to look at the engine, transmission, all those parts.
这意味着让我们打开汽车的前面部分，引擎盖，看看发动机、变速器，所有那些部分。

156
Exactly.
正是如此。

157
So you can say open the hood, but the most common one is pop the hood.
所以你可以说打开引擎盖，但最常见的是打开引擎盖。

158
So the reason is because there's a little spring, and you have to pull inside the car and it goes pop, and there's a little jump.
原因是因为有一个小弹簧，你必须在车内拉动，它会“啪”的一声跳起来。

159
Yeah, exactly.
是的，正是如此。

160
So it's literally popping.
所以它字面上是弹开的。

161
Right, or you can also say the trunk, right, the back part of the car.
对，或者你也可以说后备箱，对吧，汽车的后面部分。

162
Hey, can you pop the trunk for me?
嘿，你能帮我打开后备箱吗？

163
I've got to put some stuff inside.
我得把一些东西放进去。

164
Exactly, so pop the hood, pop the trunk.
正是如此，所以打开引擎盖，打开后备箱。

165
And on the next we've got this this girl actually who's talking about her car because she just got this car.
接下来我们有这个女孩在谈论她的车，因为她刚买了这辆车。

166
So it's another way to say it's a new car.
所以这是另一种说法，表示这是辆新车。

167
It's brand new.
它是全新的。

168
Is that more new than new?
这比新更新吗？

169
It's like newer, newer than you.
就像是更新，比你更新。

170
All right, so brand, you think about brands like Ford or Gucci.
好吧，所以品牌，你想到的品牌像福特或古驰。

171
These are brands, but brand new means she maybe got it like today.
这些是品牌，但全新意味着她可能今天刚得到它。

172
So it's brand new.
所以它是全新的。

173
It's very, very new.
它非常非常新。

174
Did you see my brand new watch?
你看到我全新的手表了吗？

175
Wow, it is nice.
哇，真不错。

176
All right, so brand new.
好吧，所以全新。

177
And well, the last phrase that we have for you today is to take apart something.
最后我们今天要讲的短语是拆解某物。

178
All right, so this is very popular with young children.
好吧，这在小孩子中非常流行。

179
Like they like to take things apart so they can find out how they work.
他们喜欢拆解东西，以便找出它们是如何工作的。

180
But to take apart means to take all the pieces and to pull them out.
但拆解意味着把所有的零件取出。

181
Yeah, I used to do that a lot when I was a kid.
是的，我小时候经常这样做。

182
I used to take apart any, any electronic device to kind of see how it works.
我曾经拆解任何电子设备，看看它是如何工作的。

183
And then I would try to put it back together again.
然后我会尝试把它重新组装起来。

184
That's why you're so smart.
这就是你这么聪明的原因。

185
Well, it never really worked.
嗯，这从来没有真正成功过。

186
It works half the time.
它一半的时间能工作。

187
So the problem is always putting them back together again, right?
所以问题总是重新组装它们，对吧？

188
Exactly.
正是如此。

189
So you can take it apart, but then you put it back together and there's always a screw missing or a screw that's extra or two or three parts.
所以你可以拆解它，但然后你重新组装时，总是缺少一个螺丝或多一个螺丝，或者两三个零件。

190
Not a good sign.
这不是一个好兆头。

191
All right, so we've taken a look at a lot of great words and phrases.
好吧，我们已经看过很多很棒的词汇和短语。

192
So let's listen to this dialogue for the last time.
所以让我们最后再听一次这个对话。

193
Howdy, nice car.

197
Luckily, I managed to start it up and drive it here.
幸运的是，我设法把它启动并开到这里。

198
What do you think it is?
你觉得是什么问题？

199
Not sure yet.
还不确定。

200
How about you pop the hood and we can take a look.
不如你打开引擎盖，我们看看。

201
Doesn't look good.
