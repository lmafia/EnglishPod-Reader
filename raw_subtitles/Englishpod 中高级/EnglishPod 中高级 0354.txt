Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.
大家好，欢迎来到EnglishPod。

2
My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

3
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about a kind of education that is quite unique, actually, a little bit different from the kind of education that most people get.
我叫Catherine，今天我们要谈论一种相当独特的教育方式，实际上与大多数人接受的教育有些不同。

4
That's right.
没错。

5
So we normally go to school to learn, but on this occasion, we're going to talk about a different way of obtaining your education.
我们通常去学校学习，但这次我们要谈论一种不同的获取教育的方式。

6
We're talking about homeschooling someone.
我们在谈论家庭教育。

7
Let's check this word out in today's vocabulary preview.
让我们在今天的词汇预览中看看这个词。

8
All right, so the word is homeschool to homeschool someone.
好的，这个词是家庭教育，给某人进行家庭教育。

9
It's, I guess, a verb.
我想，这算是一个动词。

10
And what does it mean if you're homeschooled?
如果你接受家庭教育，那是什么意思呢？

11
Well, you think about the word school, home.
嗯，你想想“学校”和“家”这个词。

12
It means that you study at home, but you don't go to school every day.
这意味着你在家学习，但你并不是每天都去学校。

13
Instead, you have a parent or maybe a friend of a parent who comes to your house to teach you every day.
相反，你有一个父母或父母的朋友每天来你家教你。

14
So it's basically like having a tutor for, but not to help you with school, but to actually teach you everything that you learn at school.
所以这基本上就像有一个家教，但不是帮助你上学，而是教你在学校学到的所有东西。

15
That's right.
没错。

16
And some people are homeschooled with their siblings, so brothers and sisters.
有些人和兄弟姐妹一起接受家庭教育。

17
Other people are homeschooled alone.
其他人则是单独接受家庭教育。

18
We'll talk about some of these things in a moment, but let's take a listen to our dialogue.
我们稍后会谈论这些事情，但先来听听我们的对话。

19
I think we should homeschool our children when we decide to have kids.
我认为我们应该在决定要孩子时给他们进行家庭教育。

20
What?
什么？

21
Why?
为什么？

22
Well, our public schools here are not very good, and private schools are just too expensive.
嗯，我们这里的公立学校并不好，私立学校又太贵了。

23
I have been reading up on some homeschooling, and it has a lot of advantages.
我一直在阅读一些关于家庭教育的资料，它有很多优点。

24
Like what?
比如什么？

25
I think that by doing something like that, we would be isolating our children from social interaction.
我认为这样做会让我们的孩子与社会互动隔离。

26
Well, first of all, I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way.
首先，我可以以更轻松有趣的方式教他们在学校学到的所有东西。

27
I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses.
我还认为一对一的课堂效果更好，因为你可以更专注于他们的优点或缺点。

28
I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea.
我认为你和我的父母都不会同意这样的想法。

29
I'll bring it up over Sunday brunch.
我会在周日早午餐时提起这个。

30
Good luck with that.
祝你好运。

31
All right, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

32
So now let's take a look at some of that language.
现在让我们看看一些语言。

33
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

34
Language takeaway.
语言要点。

35
So as we mentioned in the introduction to today's podcast, homeschooling is one of many different educational options.
正如我们在今天播客的介绍中提到的，家庭教育是许多不同教育选择之一。

36
The most common ones are in the beginning of the dialogue, public and private school.
最常见的选择是在对话开始时提到的公立和私立学校。

37
Right, so in most places you will have public schools where basically the education is paid for by the government.
没错，所以在大多数地方，你会有公立学校，基本上教育是由政府支付的。

38
Yeah, that's right.
是的，没错。

39
So public schools are schools that are available to all students.
所以公立学校是对所有学生开放的学校。

40
You don't have to pay to attend them.
你不需要支付学费就可以上学。

41
This is, of course, in America.
当然，这是在美国。

42
In Britain, the system is a bit different.
在英国，系统有点不同。

43
But in America, you have the public schools, which most kids go to.
但在美国，大多数孩子上公立学校。

44
Of course, if your parents don't want you to study in public school, there's another option that's called private school.
当然，如果你的父母不想让你上公立学校，还有一个叫做私立学校的选择。

45
That's right.
没错。

46
So a private school, as the name says, it's not really private.
所以私立学校，顾名思义，并不是真正的私立。

47
But what happens is that it's not available free for everyone.
但发生的事情是，它并不是对所有人免费开放的。

48
You have to actually pay to go to the school.
你必须实际支付才能上学。

49
That's right.
没错。

50
The school has a tuition, kind of like a private college or university.
学校有学费，有点像私立大学。

51
So you have to pay every semester or every year.
所以你必须每学期或每年支付。

52
And usually these schools also have application standards.
通常这些学校也有申请标准。

53
So they interview you, they interview your parents.
所以他们会面试你，面试你的父母。

54
So there's a lot of different things you have to do to attend these schools.
所以要上这些学校，你需要做很多不同的事情。

55
So they're a bit more exclusive.
所以它们有点更具排他性。

56
That's right.
没错。

57
Now, so these are basically some three options.
现在，这基本上是三种选择。

58
You have homeschooling, public schools, private schools.
你有家庭教育、公立学校和私立学校。

59
And well, the two parents are kind of discussing the options of why it would be maybe not a good idea to homeschool one of the kids.
而且，两个父母正在讨论为什么家庭教育可能不是一个好主意。

60
And she says that it would be isolating our children from social interaction.
她说这会让我们的孩子与社会互动隔离。

61
All right.
好的。

62
So let's take a word.
那么我们来看看一个词。

63
So first, let's take a look at the word to isolate.
首先，让我们看看“隔离”这个词。

64
This is a verb.
这是一个动词。

65
And I like to think of island, isolate, kind of similar in a way.
我喜欢把“岛”和“隔离”想象成某种相似的东西。

66
Basically, to isolate from is to keep away from.
基本上，隔离就是保持远离。

67
So if your student or your child is being homeschooled, he or she might be isolated from other students.
所以如果你的学生或孩子正在接受家庭教育，他或她可能会与其他学生隔离。

68
They're not near or with other students.
他们不在其他学生身边。

69
That's right.
没错。

70
So to isolate means to keep away from or to keep separately.
所以“隔离”意味着保持远离或单独保持。

71
So like you said, maybe if you're on an island, you are isolated from the rest of the world.
就像你说的，也许如果你在一个岛上，你就与世界其他地方隔离。

72
That's right.
没错。

73
Or if I live in the country far away from the city, I feel isolated from other people.
或者如果我住在远离城市的乡村，我会感到与其他人隔离。

74
So she's saying that the kid might be isolated from social interaction.
所以她说孩子可能会与社会互动隔离。

75
All right, now social interaction.
好的，现在“社会互动”。

76
This is a two word phrase.
这是一个双词短语。

77
We usually take it as a phrase.
我们通常把它当作一个短语。

78
This basically means talking to or playing with other people, other kids.
这基本上意味着与其他人、其他孩子交谈或玩耍。

79
Right.
没错。

80
So I guess in this case, it's a it's personal or physical social interaction, because nowadays, you have social interaction via the Internet.
所以我想在这种情况下，它是个人或身体的社会互动，因为现在你可以通过互联网进行社会互动。

81
That's right.
没错。

82
But in the case of a student going to school, it would be, of course, playing on the playground, attending class, but social interaction means talking to or being with other people.
但在学生上学的情况下，当然是指在操场上玩耍、上课，但社会互动意味着与其他人交谈或在一起。

83
That's right.
没错。

84
Well, and the other parent argued that there are many advantages.
而且另一个父母争辩说有很多优点。

85
And specifically, he said that having a one on one class is better for the kids.
他特别提到一对一的课堂对孩子更好。

86
All right, so this word one on one refers to one teacher, one student, right?
好的，所以这个词“一对一”指的是一个老师，一个学生，对吧？

87
One parent, one child.
一个父母，一个孩子。

88
It means when you're talking to someone and there's no one else around.
这意味着当你和某人交谈时，周围没有其他人。

89
All right.
好的。

90
So usually tutors teach you one on one, right?
所以通常家教是以一对一的方式教你，对吧？

91
You sit at a table and your tutor helps you study.
你坐在桌子旁，家教帮助你学习。

92
But in the case of homeschooling, the student learns one on one so learns directly from the teacher.
但在家庭教育的情况下，学生以一对一的方式学习，所以直接向老师学习。

93
Right.
没错。

94
And that's different from public schools, obviously, because you have one teacher for maybe 30 students.
这显然与公立学校不同，因为你可能有一个老师教30个学生。

95
That's right.
没错。

96
So that's not one on one.
所以这不是一对一。

97
That's one on many.
这是“一对多”。

98
Right, exactly.
对，完全正确。

99
But one on one is also a word you can use when you talk about meetings.
但“一对一”也是你在谈论会议时可以使用的一个词。

100
So you could say, Hey, Marco, can we have a one on one meeting later?
所以你可以说，嘿，Marco，我们可以稍后进行一次一对一的会议吗？

101
I'd like to talk to you alone.
我想单独和你谈谈。

102
So that means I'm not going to talk to you with other people.
所以这意味着我不会和其他人一起和你谈。

103
Right.
对。

104
Okay.
好的。

105
It's like a private meeting.
这就像一个私人会议。

106
Yeah.
是的。

但是，如果他们没有上高中，在家教育的人怎么上大学呢？

212
Well, I believe that most people, when they finish homeschooling, will take some tests to prove that they've actually learned the material that is required by the state.
嗯，我相信大多数人在完成在家教育后，会参加一些考试，以证明他们确实学到了州要求的材料。

213
Because, you know, in America, each state sets the educational standards.

What do you think about homeschooling?

222
Would you send your kids to homeschool?

223
I don't think I would do homeschooling because I think it's really important for students to or for children to learn how to get along with others and to learn to negotiate and to learn to play and to also learn to respect their teachers because you have a different relationship with your parents than you do your teachers.
我认为我不会选择在家教育，因为我认为学生或孩子学习如何与他人相处、学习谈判、玩耍以及尊重老师是非常重要的，因为你与父母的关系与老师不同。

224
And I think there's a lot of valuable social lessons you can learn at school.
我认为在学校可以学到很多有价值的社交课程。

225
But I do understand why a lot of people choose this option, especially if the schools in their area are poor performing schools so that the students aren't learning enough.
但我理解很多人选择这个选项的原因，尤其是如果他们所在地区的学校表现不佳，学生没有学到足够的知识。

226
Or if maybe they're not safe because some schools, there's some bullying or there's some violence.
或者如果学校不安全，因为有些学校存在欺凌或暴力。

227
And so for those reasons, I definitely understand the motivation to do homeschooling.

But then again, you can't... I mean, you can get homeschooled from kindergarten all the way through high school, right?
