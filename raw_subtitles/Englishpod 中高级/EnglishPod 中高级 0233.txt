And well, we're going to talk about a lot of the specific vocab that he used about this topic.
我们将讨论他在这个话题上使用的许多具体词汇。

Peter说，我好久没见你了。

49
I haven't seen you in ages.
我好久没见你了。

50
Right.
对。

51
So, obviously, he hasn't seen him in a long time.
所以，显然，他很久没见到他了。

52
And that's what in ages means.
这就是“in ages”的意思。

53
That's right.
没错。

54
So, we haven't seen each other in ages.
所以，我们很久没见面了。

55
So, what other ways can we use in ages or the word ages?
那么，我们还可以用“in ages”或“ages”这个词的其他方式是什么？

56
Well, you could actually say it's been ages.
嗯，你实际上可以说“it's been ages”。

57
So, that means it's been a long time.
这意味着很久了。

58
It's been a long time.
很久了。

59
Or we haven't gone out for ages.
或者我们很久没出去过。

60
Okay, so then you can use it with for.
好的，那么你可以和“for”一起使用。

61
For ages.
“for ages”。

62
For ages, in ages.
“for ages”，“in ages”。

63
So, the key word here is ages, which means a long time.
所以，这里的关键词是“ages”，意思是很长时间。

64
Long time.
很长时间。

65
Okay.
好的。

66
And well, he hasn't seen him in ages.

67
And the guy's like, well, you know what?
然后那个人说，嗯，你知道吗？

68
I've actually gone into trading.
我实际上开始做交易了。

69
So, that means he started doing some trading.
这意味着他开始做一些交易。

70
Right.
对。

71
Now, trading is a very broad word because you can trade, as in this case, currencies, which is basically to buy and sell currencies.
现在，交易是一个非常广泛的词，因为你可以交易，像在这种情况下，货币，基本上是买卖货币。

72
But you could also trade stocks, right?
但你也可以交易股票，对吧？

73
You can trade stocks or even people that are involved in import-export.
你可以交易股票，甚至参与进出口的人。

74
They are involved in trading.

75
Trading.
交易。

76
So, basically, trading is buying and selling something.
所以，基本上，交易就是买卖某物。

77
Right.
对。

78
So, you're trading.
所以，你在交易。

79
You are exchanging a product for money or money for a product.
你是在用产品换钱，或者用钱换产品。

80
But the difference is you're not actually making any products.
但不同的是，你实际上并没有制造任何产品。

81
Right.
对。

82
Okay.
好的。

83
So, that's called trading.
所以，这叫做交易。

84
You're not really manufacturing anything.
你并没有真正制造任何东西。

85
You're just exchanging goods and services and money.
你只是交换商品、服务和金钱。

86
Alright.
好吧。

87
So, that's for trading.
所以，这就是交易。

88
Now, moving on, he was explaining how the foreign exchange market works.
现在，继续，他在解释外汇市场是如何运作的。

89
And he says, I don't have to invest a huge amount.
他说，我不需要投资大量资金。

90
I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to 100 times that much.
我投入保证金，然后可以买卖多达100倍的金额。

91
So, Marco, here's the question.
所以，Marco，问题是。

92
What is a margin deposit?
什么是保证金存款？

93
Because a deposit is basically money that you put, invest somewhere, or that you pay in.
因为存款基本上是你放入、投资某处的钱，或者你支付的金额。

94
Right.
对。

95
Well, basically, a margin deposit is like a percentage.
嗯，基本上，保证金存款就像一个百分比。

96
So, he basically puts in a percentage of what he intends to buy.
所以，他基本上投入了他打算购买的金额的一个百分比。

97
So, for example, a margin deposit of $1,000 might be $1 or $10.
例如，1000美元的保证金存款可能是1美元或10美元。

98
Okay.
好的。

99
So, maybe if it's $10, you're talking about a 1% margin.
所以，也许如果是10美元，你在谈论1%的保证金。

100
Exactly.
正是如此。

101
So, that's what he means by a margin deposit.
所以，这就是他所说的保证金存款。

102
And that's why he explains that you don't have to have a large amount of money in order to trade in the foreign exchange market.
这就是为什么他解释说你不需要有大量资金才能在外汇市场交易。

103
You just put in a margin deposit and then you can work around that.
你只需投入保证金存款，然后你可以围绕这个进行操作。

104
Well, it sounds pretty easy, but then he explains some more details about it, and it gets to be a little bit more complicated.
嗯，听起来很简单，但接下来他解释了一些细节，变得有点复杂。

105
That's right.
没错。

106
He explained about how he makes money and how he bought some Chinese renminbi.
他解释了他是如何赚钱的，以及他是如何购买一些中国人民币的。

107
And then he sold it because it appreciated drastically.
然后他卖掉了，因为它大幅升值。

108
So, he bought it when it was cheap and he sold it when it was expensive, so the price changed.
所以，他在便宜的时候买入，在贵的时候卖出，价格发生了变化。

109
Right.
对。

110
So, this kind of price change when something goes from cheap to expensive, it's called appreciating, appreciation.
所以，这种价格变化，当某物从便宜变贵时，称为升值。

111
So, the verb is to appreciate.
所以，动词是升值。

112
It's very different from using it in the sense of you appreciate someone, right?
这与你欣赏某人的用法非常不同，对吧？

113
Like, oh, I really appreciate you.
就像，哦，我真的很欣赏你。

114
Yeah, no, it's very different.
是的，不，这非常不同。

115
We could say this about most goods or investments.
我们可以对大多数商品或投资这样说。

116
For example, my parents bought a house in 1970, and the value of the house has really appreciated over the last 40 years.
例如，我的父母在1970年买了一栋房子，房子的价值在过去40年里确实升值了。

117
So, now the value is much, much greater.
所以，现在价值大得多。

118
And actually, just mentioning it while we're on the topic, to appreciate, as you say, is something becomes more expensive.
其实，提到这一点，升值，正如你所说，是某物变得更贵。

119
The opposite, when something becomes cheaper or maybe the value goes down, is to depreciate.
相反，当某物变得更便宜或价值下降时，称为贬值。

120
Depreciate, so that D at the beginning means it's going down.
贬值，所以开头的D意味着它在下降。

121
Right.
对。

122
Okay, and moving on to our last word for language takeaway.
好的，接下来是我们最后一个语言要点。

123
So, when he was talking about selling the Chinese currency, he said that he sold it at an amazing bid.
所以，当他谈到出售中国货币时，他说他以一个惊人的出价卖掉了它。

124
Okay, let's talk about bid here.
好的，我们来谈谈出价。

125
B-I-D, bid.
B-I-D，出价。

126
What does this mean?
这是什么意思？

127
So, to bid is to place an offer for something.
所以，出价是为某物提出报价。

128
Okay, so for example, at an auction when someone is selling many old objects or some art, I can bid $100, and maybe someone doesn't accept my bid.
好的，例如，在拍卖会上，当有人出售许多旧物品或一些艺术品时，我可以出价$100，也许有人不接受我的出价。

129
But if they do accept my bid, then I pay for it.
但如果他们接受我的出价，那么我就支付。

130
Right, so basically a bid is just another way of saying an offer.
对，所以基本上出价就是另一种说法，表示报价。

131
You're offering a certain amount of money for that product or that service, and you see it a lot, for example, on eBay, right?
你为那个产品或服务提供一定金额的钱，你在eBay上经常看到，对吧？

132
That's right, so eBay is an auction website, basically, and someone who's selling someone can see many, many bids, and they select the best bid.
没错，所以eBay基本上是一个拍卖网站，卖家可以看到许多出价，然后选择最佳出价。

133
Exactly, so that's what a bid is.
正是如此，这就是出价。

134
So, that's all we have for language takeaway.
所以，这就是我们语言要点的全部内容。

135
Let's move on now to fluency builder.
现在让我们进入流利度提升。

136
Fluency builder.
流利度提升。

137
Marco, what have you been up to lately?
马尔科，你最近在忙什么？

138
I never see you.
我从未见过你。

139
Right, this is actually a very common sentence.
对，这实际上是一个非常常见的句子。

140
What have you been up to?
你在忙什么？

141
But most English learners don't really understand what it means.
但大多数英语学习者并不真正理解这是什么意思。

142
Well, this is a really interesting point because I say this all the time.
嗯，这是一个非常有趣的观点，因为我一直在说这个。

143
This is very native, very colloquial.
这非常地道，非常口语化。

144
What have you been up to?
你在忙什么？

145
It's almost the same as saying what's up.
这几乎与说“最近怎么样”是一样的。

146
What's up, or where have you been recently?
最近怎么样，或者你最近在哪里？

147
What have you been doing recently?
你最近在做什么？

148
Right.
对。

149
How's your life?
你的生活怎么样？

150
Right, so this part, up to, what have you been up to?
对，所以这一部分，忙于， 你在忙什么？

151
It doesn't really say much if you translate it literally, but basically it's what have you been doing?
如果你逐字翻译并没有太多意义，但基本上是你在做什么？

152
What have you been spending your time on?
你在花时间做什么？

153
So to be up to means to do something, to do.
所以，忙于意味着做某事，去做。

154
Right, and there are many other definitions of up to, but in this case, what have you been up to means that what have you been doing.
对，还有许多其他的“忙于”的定义，但在这种情况下，你在忙什么意味着你在做什么。

155
So next time you see a friend you haven't seen in a week or two, you can say, what have you been up to?
所以下次你见到一个一两周没见的朋友时，你可以说，你在忙什么？

156
All right, and John answers, well, you know, on top of the norm, wife, kids, and work, that phrase right there, on top of the norm.
好的，约翰回答说，嗯，你知道，除了正常的，妻子、孩子和工作，那个短语，除了正常。

157
Well, the norm here means the normal.
嗯，这里的“正常”意味着正常。

158
That means basically normal life.
这基本上意味着正常生活。

159
I've been working, I've got my kids, my wife, on top of the norm.
我一直在工作，我有我的孩子，我的妻子，除了正常。

160
Just life is normal.
生活就是正常。

161
Right, so the norm, or the wife, kids, and work, on top of that, I'm actually gone into trading, right?
对，所以正常的情况，正常的生活是妻子、孩子和工作，除此之外，我实际上还进入了交易，对吧？

162
So the normal situation, the normal life is wife, kids, and work, and then he's saying, on top of that, I've actually been doing this.
所以正常的情况，正常的生活是妻子、孩子和工作，然后他说，除此之外，我实际上在做这个。

163
Exactly.
正是如此。

164
Okay, and now moving on to when he's explaining, again, the market and the currencies, he talked about an asking price.
好的，现在继续，当他再次解释市场和货币时，他谈到了要价。

165
Okay, asking price.
好的，要价。

166
This is, remember we were talking about bids?
记得我们在谈论出价吗？

167
We could say that someone has an asking price, which is the price they would like to receive for an object or a service that they are selling.
我们可以说某人有一个要价，这是他们希望为他们出售的物品或服务所收到的价格。

168
And so, for example, I'm going to sell my desk.
所以，例如，我要卖我的桌子。

169
My asking price is $100.
我的要价是$100。

170
Maybe you don't want to pay that much, but my asking price is the way that I'm going to start.
也许你不想支付那么多，但我的要价是我开始的方式。

171
That's how much I want for it.
这就是我想要的价格。

172
Right, so that's your asking price.
对，所以这就是你的要价。

173
That's how much you ideally want to sell it for, but you can negotiate.
这就是你理想中想要出售的价格，但你可以谈判。

174
You are willing to accept maybe a lower offer.
你愿意接受可能更低的报价。

175
Exactly.
正是如此。

176
Okay, and what is our last phrase?
好的，我们最后一个短语是什么？

177
A split-second decision.
一瞬间的决定。

178
This is really, really important.
这真的非常重要。

179
These words go together very often.
这些词经常一起使用。

180
Split-second and decision.
一瞬间和决定。

181
Okay, so that basically means that you made a very quick decision.
好的，这基本上意味着你做了一个非常快速的决定。

182
That's right.
没错。

183
Split-second.
一瞬间。

184
Very fast.
非常快。

185
It's almost like it's less than a second.
几乎就像不到一秒。

186
And so a split-second decision means a decision in no time.
所以一瞬间的决定意味着在短时间内做出的决定。

187
It's very, very quick.
非常非常快。

188
So we can actually mix split-second with other things, right?
所以我们实际上可以将一瞬间与其他事物结合，对吧？

189
For example, so maybe you can say he reacted in a split-second and avoided the crash.
例如，你可以说他在一瞬间做出了反应，避免了碰撞。

190
Okay, so good for him.
好的，所以他做得很好。

191
He reacted quickly enough to avoid the accident.
他反应足够快以避免事故。

192

Okay, so that's all we have for Fluency Builder.

197
Why don't we go back, listen to this dialogue one more time, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.
我们为什么不回去，再听一遍这个对话，然后再回来聊聊。

210

219
So I made a split-second decision and sold all of my RMB at an amazing bid.

224
You're kidding.
你在开玩笑吧。

225
I'm on.
我是认真的。

226
Where do I sign up?
我在哪里注册？

227
So Marco, you have to explain this to me.
所以马尔科，你得给我解释一下。

228
We're talking about currency today.
今天我们在谈论货币。

229
So every nation has a currency.
每个国家都有自己的货币。

230
For example, in the dialogue, we learned that India has rupees, pounds are in Britain.
例如，在对话中，我们了解到印度有卢比，英国有英镑。

231
Britain has pounds and Australia has Australian dollars.
英国有英镑，澳大利亚有澳大利亚元。

232
America has American dollars.
美国有美元。

233
But you just said earlier that Ecuador has American dollars too.
但你刚才说厄瓜多尔也有美元。

234
That's right.
没错。

235
Actually, Ecuador went through a very difficult economic situation in late 1998, early 1999, where there was a hyperinflation.
实际上，厄瓜多尔在1998年底到1999年初经历了非常困难的经济形势，出现了恶性通货膨胀。

236
So basically, there was an inflation that was very, very, very large.
所以基本上，通货膨胀非常非常严重。

237
So that means that the old currency lost its value very fast.
这意味着旧货币的价值迅速下降。

238
Exactly.
正是如此。

239
So for example, if the currency before in Ecuador used to be sucres.
例如，厄瓜多尔之前的货币是苏克雷。

240
So if 10 sucres was $1, all of a sudden, it was 50 sucres was $1.
如果10苏克雷是1美元，突然变成50苏克雷是1美元。

241
Oh, wow.
哦，哇。

242
So and it got to the point where goods and services went from $3,000 to $1 to $25,000 to $1.
这导致商品和服务的价格从3000美元到1美元涨到25000美元到1美元。

243
Okay, so people have bags full of money, and it's not really worth anything.
好吧，人们口袋里装满了钱，但实际上没什么价值。

244
Exactly.
正是如此。

245
So what happened was the central bank couldn't absorb this currency depreciation.
所以发生的事情是中央银行无法吸收这种货币贬值。

246
They couldn't really regulate prices.
他们无法真正调控价格。

247
Obviously, salaries were about the same.
显然，工资差不多。

248
So you have a lot less money comparatively.
所以相对而言，你的钱少得多。

249
And so the government decided that there were two options.
所以政府决定有两个选择。

250
Either they would follow Argentina's example, what they did a couple of years before, and set a fixed rate.
要么他们跟随阿根廷的例子，几年前他们所做的，设定一个固定汇率。

251
So in Argentina, it's three pesos to $1.
在阿根廷，三比索兑换1美元。

252
Or we would just get rid of our currency and just use US dollars.
要么我们就放弃我们的货币，直接使用美元。

253
So that's what they did, right?
所以他们就这样做了，对吧？

254
They used US dollars.
他们使用美元。

255
And now, if you ever travel to Ecuador, you will use US dollars.
现在，如果你去厄瓜多尔，你会使用美元。

256
The same exact bills that you use in the US are the same exact bills in Ecuador.
你在美国使用的钞票在厄瓜多尔也是一样的。

257
So no need to exchange currency.
所以不需要兑换货币。

258
No need to exchange currency.
不需要兑换货币。
