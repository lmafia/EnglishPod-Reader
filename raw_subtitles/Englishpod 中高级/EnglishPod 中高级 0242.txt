Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.
大家好，欢迎来到EnglishPod。

2
My name is Marco.
我叫Marco。

3
My name is Katherine, and today we have a very technical, very advanced lesson for you.
我叫Katherine，今天我们有一节非常技术性、非常高级的课程。

4
This is all about one of my favorite subjects.
这都是关于我最喜欢的主题之一。

5
That's right, we're going to talk about music, but specifically we're going to talk about the piano and learning how to play the piano.
没错，我们要谈论音乐，特别是钢琴和学习如何演奏钢琴。

6
So we're going to talk about very specific vocab related to this instrument.
所以我们将讨论与这个乐器相关的非常具体的词汇。

7
Right, so piano and playing music, not listening to music.
对，钢琴和演奏音乐，而不是听音乐。

8
Right.
对。

9
So we're going to hear a lot of interesting words and phrases here.
所以我们会听到很多有趣的单词和短语。

10
Some of them actually come from foreign languages like Italian.
其中一些实际上来自外语，比如意大利语。

11
So listen up, we'll be back in a moment.
所以请注意，我们马上回来。

12
And when we come back, we'll be talking about what these words and phrases mean.
当我们回来时，我们将讨论这些单词和短语的意思。

13
Hi, Cody, how did practicing go this week?
嗨，Cody，这周的练习怎么样？

14
Well, I had several tests and an oral presentation this week, so I didn't get a chance to memorize the second page.
嗯，我这周有几次测试和一次口头报告，所以没机会记住第二页。

15
But I think I mastered the tricky section.
但我觉得我掌握了那个棘手的部分。

16
Great.
很好。

17
Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first.
首先热身，做一些音阶和琶音。

18
Good, good.
好的，好的。

19
This week, work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the 16th notes.
这周，练习在演奏最后部分的十六分音符时保持节奏稳定。

20
Now, let's take a look at this tricky section.
现在，让我们看看这个棘手的部分。

21
Charlene, before I start, I was wondering if it was okay if I put a small crescendo in here and then a decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here.
Charlene，在我开始之前，我想知道我能否在这里加一个小的渐强，然后在这里再渐弱回到极轻。

22
It might work.
可能可以。

23
I'll have to hear it.
我得听听。

24
Show me what you've done.
给我看看你做了什么。

25
Not bad.
不错。

26
It was horrible.
太糟糕了。

27
I played it much better at home.
我在家演奏得好多了。

28
It's just nerves.
只是紧张。

29
Just play the right hand for now.
现在只演奏右手。

30
Good, good.
好的，好的。

31
Don't forget the accidentals.
别忘了意外音。

32
The key signature says that note should be a G sharp, but now it's a G natural.
调号显示那个音应该是G升，而现在是G自然。

33
Now add the bass clef.
现在加上低音谱号。

34
Oh, you're going too fast.
哦，你太快了。

35
Remember the tempo for this piece is Andante.
记住这首曲子的速度是行板。

36
Is that better?
这样更好吗？

37
Yes, much better.
是的，好多了。

38
Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal.
注意你抬脚离开踏板的地方。

39
What was that?
那是什么？

40
Sorry, the stretch for that octave is always hard to make.
对不起，那个八度的伸展总是很难做到。

41
That's okay.
没关系。

42
Keep going.
继续。

43
You're moving ahead, but it leaps and bounds.
你进展很快，但步伐很大。

44
Watch your dynamics.
注意你的力度。

45
Keep your elbows lifted.
保持肘部抬起。

46
Remember to stroke the keys.
记得轻触琴键。

47
Don't pound.
不要用力敲打。

48
That's better.
这样更好。

49
Remember that as a pianist or any other musician, your technique will be what separates you from the pack just as much or as more so as your musicianship.
记住，作为钢琴家或其他任何音乐家，你的技巧将是你与其他人区别开来的关键，甚至比你的音乐才能更重要。

50
All right, we're back.
好的，我们回来了。

51
So you probably noticed that there are a lot of ways to describe certain aspects of playing the piano.
所以你可能注意到，有很多方式来描述演奏钢琴的某些方面。

52
They talked about scales and all that stuff, so why don't we take a deeper look at this vocab in Language Takeaway Part 1.
他们谈到了音阶和所有那些东西，所以我们为什么不在语言收获第一部分深入看看这些词汇呢。

53
Okay, so the first part of the lesson is the warm up.
好的，课程的第一部分是热身。

54
That's when we start to get our fingers moving and really stretch out.
这是我们开始活动手指并真正伸展的时候。

55
This is an important part of any musician's routine because it's also a way to practice some very basic, very fundamental things, the first of which is a scale.
这是任何音乐家日常生活中重要的一部分，因为这也是练习一些非常基本、非常基础的东西，其中第一个就是音阶。

56
Okay, so actually Cody started warming up with some scales.
好的，实际上Cody开始热身做一些音阶。

57
So what exactly are scales?
那么音阶到底是什么？

58
Well, basically there are different musical notes.
基本上就是不同的音乐音符。

59
Some people know them as do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do.
有些人称它们为do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do。

60
Some people call them C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.
有些人称它们为C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C。

61
But each of those and many others have scales, so that's eight notes together.
但每一个以及许多其他的都有音阶，所以这就是八个音符在一起。

62
Okay, so basically when you're playing scales, you're just playing a sequence of these eight notes.
好的，基本上当你演奏音阶时，你只是在演奏这八个音符的序列。

63
Right, going up or down.
对，向上或向下。

64
Okay, to warm up.
好的，热身。

65
And what about an arpeggio?
那么琶音呢？

66
I think this is Italian, right?
我想这也是意大利语，对吧？

67
Definitely.
当然。

68
Arpeggio is another kind of warm up, where you're not playing every single note, you're playing some notes in a scale.
琶音是另一种热身方式，你不是演奏每一个音符，而是演奏音阶中的一些音符。

69
Alright, so da, da, da, da, da, da.
好吧，da, da, da, da, da, da。

70
That's an arpeggio.
这就是琶音。

71
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

72
And as you said, these are usually for warm ups, right?
正如你所说，这些通常是用于热身，对吧？

73
Yeah, they're also very important because they come into play later when you're talking about the key that a song or piece of music is in.
是的，它们也非常重要，因为在谈论一首歌曲或音乐作品的调时，它们会派上用场。

74
So this helps you memorize the key that some music is in.
所以这有助于你记住某些音乐的调。

75
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

76
So I think related to this is the rhythm of the piece that you're playing.
所以我认为与此相关的是你演奏的曲子的节奏。

77
That's right.
没错。

78
So rhythm is really important.
所以节奏真的很重要。

79
Some people can even say, you know, he's got rhythm or they have rhythm.
有些人甚至可以说，你知道，他有节奏，或者他们有节奏。

80
It's a way to describe the beat of a kind of music.
这是一种描述某种音乐节拍的方式。

81
So sometimes it has to do with how fast or how slow something is.
所以有时它与某事的快慢有关。

82
Other times it has to do with the way that the notes work together.
其他时候则与音符如何协同工作有关。

83
For example, a steady beat would be one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
例如，稳定的节拍是“一、二、三、四，一、二、三、四”。

84
This is a complicated beat.
这是一个复杂的节拍。

85
It goes ta, ti, Tripoli, ta, ti, Tripoli.
它是“ta, ti, Tripoli, ta, ti, Tripoli”。

86
So this is a very difficult kind of rhythm.
所以这是一种非常困难的节奏。

87
Okay, so the rhythm is just kind of... it gives you how fast, how slow it is.
好的，所以节奏就是……它给你快慢的感觉。

88
And I guess if you can take a look at notes and you can play it in many different rhythms, but not necessarily they're going to sound correct.
我想如果你能看看音符，你可以用许多不同的节奏演奏它，但不一定听起来正确。

89
Right, and actually it's interesting.
对，实际上这很有趣。

90
In English we also have a group of instruments that are called rhythm instruments.
在英语中，我们也有一组被称为节奏乐器的乐器。

91
So this would be like the drums.
所以这就像鼓。

92
Okay, so it gives the beat.
好的，所以它给出节拍。

93
Yes.
是的。

94
Very good.
非常好。

95
And well, moving on, I think some other Italian words popped up in here when they talked about crescendo and decrescendo.
好吧，继续，我想在谈到渐强和渐弱时，这里出现了一些其他意大利词。

96
Right, so crescendo is when something becomes louder.
对，所以渐强是指某事变得更响。

97
So I can make a crescendo.
所以我可以做一个渐强。

98
But a decrescendo, de in Italian, just like in English, means it's the opposite.
但渐弱，意大利语中的de，就像英语中一样，意味着相反。

99
So it means it's getting really softer.
所以它意味着变得非常轻。

100
And what about pianissimo?
那么极轻呢？

101
Pianissimo is basically an indication, it also comes from Italian, it's an indication that a player, a musician should play something very, very, very quietly.
Pianissimo基本上是一个指示，它也来自意大利语，表示演奏者应该非常非常安静地演奏某样东西。

102
It's almost like a whisper.
几乎就像耳语。

103
Okay, so these three words have to do with the volume of...
好的，这三个词与...的音量有关。

104
or how loud or not so loud you play the instrument.
或者说你演奏乐器的响亮程度。

105
That's right.
没错。

106
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

107
And well, moving on now, we talk about accidentals.
现在继续，我们谈谈意外音。

108
Okay, this is important.
好的，这很重要。

109
Remember earlier we were talking about scales.
记得之前我们在谈论音阶。

110
Well, for example, the G scale has one sharp.
比如说，G音阶有一个升音。

111
So that's an F sharp.
所以是F升音。

112
So if I'm playing it on the piano, there are seven white keys and one black key.
所以如果我在钢琴上演奏，有七个白键和一个黑键。

113
Okay, so actually here they mention G sharp and then something like G natural.
好的，实际上这里提到G升音，然后是G自然音。

114
All this just like for everyone that's out there is complete Chinese and we have no idea what this is all about.
这一切对外面的人来说完全是中文，我们不知道这是什么。

115
So you have the accidentals and G sharp and you're describing something about sharpness with accidentals.
所以你有意外音和G升音，你在描述与意外音相关的锐度。

116
That's right.
没错。

117
So basically if you look at a piano, you have white keys.
基本上如果你看钢琴，你会看到白键。

118
Right.
对。

119
Those are... those are naturals, they don't have a sharp or a flat.
那些是...那些是自然音，没有升音或降音。

120
The sharps and flats are actually played on the black keys.
升音和降音实际上是在黑键上演奏的。

121
Usually it's a half step from a normal note.
通常是从正常音符的半音。

122
So G, it's a half step.
所以G，是半音。

123
We're talking about different keys.
我们在谈论不同的音。

124
So if something is in the key of G, and all the music people know what this is, key of G, there's one accidental.
所以如果某样东西在G调中，所有音乐人都知道这是什么，G调，有一个意外音。

125
What's the accidental?
意外音是什么？

126
It's always F sharp.
总是F升音。

127
And so an accidental means a sharp or a flat in that key.
所以意外音意味着在那个调中的升音或降音。

128
Okay, and when we talk about sharps on the piano, they're basically the black keys.
好的，当我们谈论钢琴上的升音时，它们基本上是黑键。

129
Yes, well, sharps and flats can both be black keys.
是的，升音和降音都可以是黑键。

130
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

131
And well, apart from accidentals and G sharp, G natural, the teacher also talked about a bass clef.
除了意外音和G升音、G自然音，老师还谈到了低音谱。

132
Okay, this is important for people who play lower instruments, like the bass, you know, the upright bass, that big one, or people who play the piano, obviously.
好的，这对演奏低音乐器的人很重要，比如低音提琴，那个大提琴，或者显然是钢琴。

133
This represents a way of writing the lower notes.
这代表了一种书写低音符的方法。

134
Okay, so you see the lines, those five lines on paper, and people write the notes.
好的，你看到纸上的五条线，人们在上面写音符。

135
Well, sometimes they're for higher instruments, you know, the flute or the trumpet, but sometimes when they're for lower instruments, like the left hand of a piano or for the upright bass, you have to write it in a special register, a special part of the sound kind of continuum, and that's the treble, that's the bass clef.
有时它们是为高音乐器准备的，比如长笛或小号，但有时当它们是为低音乐器准备的，比如钢琴的左手或低音提琴时，你必须在一个特殊的音域中书写，这是高音谱，这是低音谱。

136
Okay, so basically, if anyone has ever seen piano notes, it tells you what to play with your left hand and your right hand.
好的，基本上，如果有人见过钢琴音符，它告诉你用左手和右手演奏什么。

137
So I imagine the bass clef will be everything that's on your left hand because that sounds like deeper, graver, right?
所以我想低音谱会是你左手上所有的音，因为那听起来更深、更沉重，对吧？

138
Yeah, it's lower.
是的，更低。

139
So it's lower on the scale.
所以在音阶上更低。

140
Instead of like, up high, up here, where it's on the treble clef.
而不是像在高音谱上那样高。

141
Alright, so the opposite would be the treble clef.
好吧，所以相反的是高音谱。

142
That's right, the treble clef is up higher, it's most other instruments like the trumpet.
没错，高音谱在上面，适用于大多数其他乐器，比如小号。

143
The bass clef is for lower instruments, and it just means that the way that you read the music on the page is a little bit different.
低音谱适用于低音乐器，这意味着你在页面上阅读音乐的方式有点不同。

144
Okay, very good.
好的，非常好。

145
And, well, we also got into things like tempo, and the piece was described as andante.
我们还讨论了节奏，这首曲子被描述为安达。

146
Andante, this is a very Italian word.
安达，这是一个非常意大利的词。

147
Okay, so andante means that something is played slowly.
好的，所以安达意味着某样东西被缓慢演奏。

148
Okay, so apart from andante, so it's a style or a tempo, I guess tempo is the speed of which it's played, right?
好的，除了安达，它是一种风格或节奏，我想节奏是演奏的速度，对吧？

149
That's right, but you're right to say that it's also a style because in many symphonies, for example, there's a movement, a part of the symphony that's called the andante, and that's when everything starts to get slow and serious or pretty.
没错，但你说得对，它也是一种风格，因为在许多交响乐中，例如，有一个乐章，交响乐的一部分叫做安达，那是当一切开始变得缓慢和严肃或美丽的时候。

150
I've heard, I don't know, in piano I've heard of something called staccato, and I think this is also related to tempo, right?
我听说过，我不知道，在钢琴上我听说过一种叫做断奏的东西，我想这也与节奏有关，对吧？

151
Staccato is the way that you play something, so instead of having these long, pretty notes, you're playing them like this.
断奏是你演奏某样东西的方式，所以不是长长的美丽音符，而是像这样演奏。

152
They're very, very sharp.
它们非常非常尖锐。

153
Right, like a machine gun.
对，就像机枪。

154
Okay, but it's not related to the tempo.
好的，但这与节奏无关。

155
It's kind of more just like the way that you press the keys.
这更像是你按键的方式。

156
Exactly, it's a style for playing.
正是如此，这是一种演奏风格。

157
Okay.
好的。

158
All right, well, the teacher also told the student to be careful where they lift the foot off the pedal, and the student said, oh, I'm just so sorry.
好吧，老师还告诉学生要小心他们抬起脚踏板的地方，学生说，哦，我真的很抱歉。

159
The stretch for that octave is always hard to make.
这个八度的伸展总是很难做到。

160
Okay, so an octave is really, really important in music.
好的，所以八度在音乐中真的很重要。

161
Like we were talking about earlier with a scale, a scale is eight notes.
就像我们之前谈到的音阶，音阶是八个音符。

162
Well, the root, the place the word octave comes from is the number eight, like an octagon.
好吧，八度这个词的根源是数字八，就像八边形。

163
So octave means eight notes together, or like low C, high C, that's an octave.
所以八度意味着八个音符在一起，或者像低C，高C，那是一个八度。

164
Oh, okay.
哦，好的。

165
So think about the piano.
所以想想钢琴。

166
When you're putting your fingers on the keys, covering eight keys means you have to stretch your thumb and your pinky out really, really far.
当你把手指放在键上，覆盖八个键意味着你必须把拇指和小指伸得非常非常远。

167
And so he's saying, ah, sorry, it's hard for me to do this because the octave, that stretch is really hard for my hand.
所以他说，啊，对不起，我很难做到这一点，因为八度，这个伸展对我的手来说真的很难。

168
Right, okay.
对，好的。

169
So this is different from an eighth, right?
所以这与八分音符不同，对吧？

170
Well, it depends.
嗯，这要看。

171
Are you talking about eighth note?
你是在谈论八分音符吗？

172
I don't know, because I just came into the mic, because an octave is eight and an eighth note, is it different, I imagine?
我不知道，因为我刚刚进入麦克风，因为八度是八，而八分音符，我想是不同的，对吧？

173
Yeah, well, you heard in the dialogue 16th note, eighth note.
是的，你在对话中听到十六分音符、八分音符。

174
That's actually talking about the length of a note, how long you hold it.
那实际上是在谈论音符的长度，你保持它的时间。

175
Okay.
好的。

176
So basically you're saying it's the way you measure the music.
所以基本上你是在说这是你测量音乐的方式。

177
You can have four count or three count, but you divide that into pieces.
你可以有四拍或三拍，但你把它分成几部分。

178
It's like a pie in math where you divide it into pieces.
就像数学中的派，你把它分成几部分。

179
So if it's a 16th note or an eighth note, that's the length based on the kind of music you're playing.
所以如果是十六分音符或八分音符，那是基于你演奏的音乐类型的长度。

180
So I imagine 16th note is shorter than eighth.
所以我想十六分音符比八分音符短。

181
Yes.
是的。

182
Okay, at least I got that one right.
好的，至少我对这一点是对的。

183
And 32nd note is shorter than a 16th note.
而三十二分音符比十六分音符短。

184
Wow, you have all the way up to 32nd.
哇，你一直到三十二分音符。

185
64th note is shorter.
六十四分音符更短。

186
Oh, wow.
哦，哇。

187
Okay.
好的。

188
It gets very complicated, very mathy.
这变得非常复杂，非常数学化。

189
All right.
好吧。

190
And towards the end, the teacher recommended for Cody to watch his dynamics.
在最后，老师建议Cody注意他的力度。

191
What does she mean with watch your dynamics?
她说“注意你的力度”是什么意思？

192
I used to get this all the time in music.
我在音乐中经常听到这个。

193
So you're concentrating on your music, you're playing, you're getting the notes, and Cody is stretching his hands, the octaves are so far away, and he forgets to play it loud or soft.
所以你专注于你的音乐，你在演奏，你在获取音符，而Cody在伸展他的手，八度距离太远，他忘记了要演奏得响或轻。

194
Oh, okay.
哦，好的。

195
Because on the page it says, like we heard earlier, decrescendo.
因为在页面上它说，就像我们之前听到的，渐弱。

196
So get much, much softer.
所以要变得非常非常轻柔。

197
So Cody completely forgot.
所以Cody完全忘记了。

198
He's not reading the page and seeing what it says about the volume of the music.
他没有看乐谱，没看到关于音乐音量的说明。

199
So basically the dynamics are like the instructions of how loud to play it or not so loud.
所以基本上，力度就像是关于演奏多大声或不那么大声的指示。

200
Exactly.
正是如此。

201
So does it say pianissimo?
那上面写着“极轻”吗？

202
Or the opposite.
或者相反。

203
Does it say forte?
上面写着“强”吗？

204
And it will actually say this on the notes.
它实际上会在音符上写出来。

205
Forte, it will say that.
强，它会这样写。

206
F-O-R-T-E.
F-O-R-T-E。

207
Or sometimes just F.
或者有时只是F。

208
Oh, okay.
哦，好的。

209
So pi is piano.
所以“pi”是“轻”。

210
That means, like we said earlier, quiet.
这意味着，正如我们之前所说，安静。

211
Pianissimo is P-P-P.
“极轻”是P-P-P。

212
It's very, very quiet.
非常非常安静。

213
F is forte.
F是“强”。

214
Loud.
大声。

215
Okay, so I think, well, if anyone out there plays an instrument you can relate in, you can maybe know about these things that you may know it in your original language.
好吧，我想，如果在场的任何人会演奏乐器，你们可能会对此有所了解，可能会知道这些你们在母语中可能知道的事情。

216
I know many people who play musical instruments and don't really know the technical words in their original language.
我认识很多演奏乐器的人，他们并不真正知道自己母语中的技术词汇。

217
I mean, things like andante and pianissimo, things like this I think are universal, right?
我是说，像“行板”和“极轻”这样的东西，我认为是通用的，对吧？

218
They're used in whatever language.
它们在任何语言中都被使用。

219
Exactly.
正是如此。

220
Very widely used.
使用得非常广泛。

221
But things like the accidentals or bass clef or scales and stuff like that, I think it's obviously in different languages.
但像是变音符、低音谱号或音阶之类的东西，我认为显然是不同语言的。

222
For example, you know Italian, like scales or accidentals.
例如，你知道意大利语，像音阶或变音符。

223
They're different.
它们是不同的。

224
They're different, right?
它们是不同的，对吧？

225
They're different.
它们是不同的。

226
All of the other words.
其他所有词汇。

227
So the instructions on the page, because music is shared all over the world, the instructions on the page are almost always in Italian, so piano, andante, or they're in German.
所以乐谱上的指示，因为音乐在全世界共享，乐谱上的指示几乎总是用意大利语写的，比如“轻”、“行板”，或者用德语写的。

228
Oh, really?
哦，真的吗？

229
But everything else, scales, octaves, these are all in your native language.
但其他所有的，音阶、八度，这些都是用你的母语。

230
And so they're very, very important to study if you want to play.
所以如果你想演奏，它们是非常非常重要的学习内容。

231
And I think very, very useful if you want to study an instrument.
我认为如果你想学习乐器，它们也非常有用。

232
Yeah, of course.
是的，当然。

233
I think it's also a very good idea to just have a general knowledge about these things because, you know, sometimes it's nice to know a little bit about it.
我认为了解这些事情也是一个很好的主意，因为，有时了解一点关于它的知识是很好的。

234
And maybe if a friend is talking about music, you can maybe understand a little bit more about what it's like.
